Due to a bug fix in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/28687 transcription using a multilingual Whisper will default to language detection followed by transcription instead of translation to English.This might be a breaking change for your use case. If you want to instead always translate your audio to English, make sure to pass `language='en'`.
Passing a tuple of `past_key_values` is deprecated and will be removed in Transformers v4.43.0. You should pass an instance of `EncoderDecoderCache` instead, e.g. `past_key_values=EncoderDecoderCache.from_legacy_cache(past_key_values)`.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
