Due to a bug fix in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/28687 transcription using a multilingual Whisper will default to language detection followed by transcription instead of translation to English.This might be a breaking change for your use case. If you want to instead always translate your audio to English, make sure to pass `language='en'`.
Passing a tuple of `past_key_values` is deprecated and will be removed in Transformers v4.43.0. You should pass an instance of `EncoderDecoderCache` instead, e.g. `past_key_values=EncoderDecoderCache.from_legacy_cache(past_key_values)`.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

Well, he's going out to a party like I have. Well, he's already 16 years old.  But I mean I never did.  Well, I won't give you any examples. But anyway, if I told them they couldn't do it, I would try them. Swearing is one of my bad habits.

If they did catch me doing something that I'd be telling them, no, you cannot do, I would apologize and say, mommy was bad and mommy did that. I got sick of my mouth one time because of it.  Well, that's really admirable. Oh, no. I mean, if you want to hear the story, it's funny. Well, the TV just, I was baking pie, and I was taking this pie out of the oven. It was a cherry pie or an apple pie.  I said  I like to sit there for a minute before I take it out. I take it on out and sit on top of it. Well, mommy said a bad word.
