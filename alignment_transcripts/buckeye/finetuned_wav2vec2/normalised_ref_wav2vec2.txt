yes but theres nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured something weirds going on i didnt know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce related just basically dumb because the divorce wasnt going to faze me because the entire marriage was we knew we knew from the beginning it was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so were just kind of waiting around going oh theyre gonna be divorced in a couple months and sure enough so anyway um so i i look at these people and their names are the and so the are coming forward with two police officers behind them and mister is kind of a large gentleman and hes way too somber for this experience and if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce im going to give you some sort of shit for it and at the same time um mrs used to be a principal of mine elementary school

um-hum 

Recording: (23/ 8002) 
well i one thing uh you know being uh uh i came from basically a poor poor uh uh lifestyle uh early life and everything you know so uh um if anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh towards people that had an influence had money and didnt do any thing good with it you know im a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people i dont always practice what i preach but you know thats id be a good philosophy to live by uh and people of other religions and everything um you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raised baptist basically but uh i practice more catholic than anything else now uh but im generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and everything just because i find it interesting 

Recording: (24/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (25/ 8002)

Recording: (26/ 8002) 
yeah but the ones that they really needed to do like two well like seventy one and seventy i mean that i dont its a bottle neck area yknow and they really should have done something with that twenty years ago yknow 

Recording: (27/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (28/ 8002) 
um-hum plus you get so many different students and what i like just walking over here today yknow its kind of thought yknow i wonder how many of these people i walk by yknow are gonna be here in january because yknow a lot of because i did yknow i thought well this is cool man yknow 

Recording: (29/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (30/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (31/ 8002) 
yeah but it was just so funny yknow i know we talked too long but this is so much fun 

Recording: (32/ 8002) 
it was a nice birthday party 

Recording: (33/ 8002) 
unit does it um and it wasnt that i had a bad family unit it was just that there wasnt yknow we never talked about it my sister and were just talking about that because wewere she goes we were like yknow how did people start talking about sex and relationships and what not she goes you dont mom and dad handed me a book im like they did 

Recording: (34/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (35/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (36/ 8002) 
i mean i think thats the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe im gay i dont know if im gay or what well hopefully theyll know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay okay were they gay before but they did like women 

Recording: (37/ 8002) 
only the can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that the people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in a yknow in a place that no child could find it theyre to blame they are theyre to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it but yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents didnt were clueless i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes in to a garage every night and you hear clanging and and theyre buying gun metal and yknow then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing its one thing them having a site on the internet 

Recording: (38/ 8002) 
i do know a few people that are gay um but theyre in their thirties 

Recording: (39/ 8002) 
we have the time 

Recording: (40/ 8002) 
uh huh 

Recording: (41/ 8002) 
i mean if we were that racist of a city then we wouldnt be that accepting to gay pride marches and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back 

Recording: (42/ 8002) 
i dont think its i dont think its really affected me i mean obviously theres more places to go shopping or to eat or you theres more traffic laugh i dont particularly care much for um but it i dont think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other it and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood its it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool i went to public school 

Recording: (43/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah um-hum yeah 

Recording: (44/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (45/ 8002) 
yeah hes not getting that i dont think hes getting that learning hes hes more his uh thats his grandmother yknow watching him and yknow i wish that she would like do more of the learning things that the day cares do do yknow but 

Recording: (46/ 8002) 
its so funny thats what my daughters i do were then were always looking and saying hmm there could do this this this this yeah and plus 

Recording: (47/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i didnt have back problems or anything like that but it was just like the feeling it was like im not right 

Recording: (48/ 8002) 
well its not that theres been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (49/ 8002) 
well yeah its i just give you a rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here 

Recording: (50/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (51/ 8002) 
what department 

Recording: (52/ 8002) 
hate crime is a is an is an interesting term um all crimes all murders are hate related i uh im not sure it thats uh it its difficult i we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was uh in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism um and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime and yknow are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and theres already a a law on the books so i dont think we need to have a hate crime over and above that yknow uh the the people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and shouldnt have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people its going to turn people against uh gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and yknow going to yknow opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things arent better uh yknow that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that wasnt my goal my goal wasnt to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury convict white men of of killing a black man were in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (53/ 8002) 
yeah its 

Recording: (54/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (55/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (56/ 8002) 
is 

Recording: (57/ 8002) 
eighty eight so we we just had our eleventh wedding anniversary yeah 

Recording: (58/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (59/ 8002) 
hed be lost 

Recording: (60/ 8002) 
yeah oh yeah yknow people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so its kind of like the small town thing which would have goods and bads but i dont know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with its still live in town and yknow they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and a lot of participation in that and so 

Recording: (61/ 8002) 
and anymore youre lucky if you know your neighbors because everybodys so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you dont really actually speak to the people youre hearing about are on tv or radio or via telephone or whatever 

Recording: (62/ 8002) 
yeah i think theyre really helpful and i think that its the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it theres really but theres so much fraud and theres so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it yknow like with me i didnt wanna stay on it i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i didnt have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home theres like nine yknow there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that years car i mean she had a brand new yknow like whatever year it was thats the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and yknow i thought 

Recording: (63/ 8002) 
<laugh> uh huh 

Recording: (64/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (65/ 8002) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the honking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a a debate about it but it we didnt really resolve it 

Recording: (66/ 8002) 
right right but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute yknow uh <laugh> its so obvious hello <laugh> but <laugh> oh yeah 

Recording: (67/ 8002) 
very very much so now twenty fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would call we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today were no longer a democratic government as defined back there then uh yeah were still democratic according to our new definition of this developed over time uh but its far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (68/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (69/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (70/ 8002) 
and walks away 

Recording: (71/ 8002) 
because of the gay activism 

Recording: (72/ 8002) 
um he moved to texas because like he was moving into like the he was going to s m u there and like so i moved back from florida back to up up here because i didnt wanna i didnt wanna go with because texas is terrible and like um so then like my mom see like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (73/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (74/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (75/ 8002) 
since march too 

Recording: (76/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (77/ 8002) 
because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialists than they are capitalists and theyre easier to deal with and theyre more reasonable people in my opinion much more reasonable but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and and all im the minority in my family <laugh> believe me <laugh> and uh theyre very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (78/ 8002) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in virginia beach so 

Recording: (79/ 8002) 
and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in the columbus coated fabrics plant which is plant that makes coated fabrics they make uh the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and theres fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (80/ 8002) 
doesnt that mean make 

Recording: (81/ 8002) 
no i 

Recording: (82/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (83/ 8002) 
um-hum i dont know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was called a lot of little things <laugh> 

Recording: (84/ 8002) 
yknow a historic building theyre like oh theres no history in america yknow 

Recording: (85/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (86/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (87/ 8002) 
right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months sober and he worked every day 

Recording: (88/ 8002) 
yeah so it shes funny because shes gained twenty six pounds and yet she doesnt look pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today 

Recording: (89/ 8002) 
ive never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women arent priests is because they dont show any kind of uh spiritual leadership i ive never heard that said and there must be people who think that 

Recording: (90/ 8002) 
that they just dont have those 

Recording: (91/ 8002) 
but thats my plan 

Recording: (92/ 8002) 
uh but if you love the if you love someone you want them to do whats right and you want them to learn and if thats the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but youre loving other people also in other words youre not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here im not gonna let get away with it no im sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for im sorry youve done that dear but and i love you dearly but i try to teach you differently i dont know where you went wrong i dont know what i did wrong whatever but you gotta pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere uh but now you said family yes i think the reason and that at our age we look back everyone was born and everyone was loved by a father and by a when they were little and how their formative years are and the education the um the way they were uh taught as they were growing up does help them to become what that president is what that any politician is any minister or anybody else it the way you are raised i firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that ive done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here yknow and i think that it bears on everybody so thats why it really begins with the family 

Recording: (93/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (94/ 8002) 
okay uh ive been in columbus since nineteen seventy seven and uh im an air traffic controller and i have three more days to work before i retire im i i im retiring sunday so and tomorrows my retirement dinner so uh a little nervous about what i have to do there yknow theyve told me nothing except show up 

Recording: (95/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (96/ 8002) 
so the state would pay for it 

Recording: (97/ 8002) 
oh okay <laugh> oh okay so 

Recording: (98/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (99/ 8002) 
no my mom uh shes not an invalid uh shes seventy two years old but they go out usually to yard sales stuff like that stuff i dont wanna do 

Recording: (100/ 8002) 
so be it yknow we had the out there helping out the the g is fine team effort wasnt it but then after g is came home the little lady went back in to the house and business all these idle lines say hey we can do something here because in those days the little lady said well ill go out and get a little odd job uh we want a little thing mom would do pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad was a primary breadwinner but shed go out and do some odd jobs just to compliment their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit and now i mean im jumping ahead of myself here but business said hey lets produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (101/ 8002) 
oh yeah and and i ill probably step on your toes here but i im not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home and yknow my parents didnt do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to yknow and i did it for years and and i just feel that yknow i i hope you dont have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in daycare and uh yknow after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee id like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie well just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go well be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (102/ 8002) 
<laugh> especially why yknow we try at at five in the morning <laugh> 

Recording: (103/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (104/ 8002)

Recording: (105/ 8002) 
oh yeah thats beautiful yeah 

Recording: (106/ 8002) 
and she said shed get back to me on it well never heard nothing from her and shes done that to me i dont know how many times 

Recording: (107/ 8002) 
um when i went i went with my friend 

Recording: (108/ 8002) 
yknow 

Recording: (109/ 8002) 
um so i just came down here then 

Recording: (110/ 8002) 
i love ohio state but i dont i i guess from a career perspective they say its not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but 

Recording: (111/ 8002) 
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if i slept at night instead of staying up 

Recording: (112/ 8002) 
really and people use do people use them 

Recording: (113/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (114/ 8002) 
so therefore they can theyre not public they can put whatever they want 

Recording: (115/ 8002) 
right well heres heres a can of manwich its a dollar fifty and well give you fifty cents off well gee if i just use the recipe out the microwave cookbook i can make it at home for like three cents but but yknow why its convenience i can throw it in the microwave and itll be done in five minutes yknow like mashed potatoes the microwave or yknow its like hello its yknow i i can understand how people do it because they come home from work and its like i dont want to be a cook i dont want to be a clean up so ill pay somebody do this pay somebody do that and pretty soon you see all the money theyve been making gone 

Recording: (116/ 8002) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (117/ 8002) 
oh my my sisters religious and that that tends to warp her view of everything 

Recording: (118/ 8002)

Recording: (119/ 8002) 
uh he was a uh railroad clerk 

Recording: (120/ 8002)

Recording: (121/ 8002) 
thought about it ive come home get in the car and go out go somewhere yknow or come home get something to eat and yeah that was about it i ah but i think that has a lot to do with it um i dont really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching howdy doody and all that stuff and course it wasnt the uh violent stuff maybe that you can see on tv now or uh but i dont really think the media just hasnt had that much to do with it its just a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast yknow with uh uh the vietnamese guy uh vietcong guy getting his brains blowed out on national tv yknow and uh uh that didnt make me go out and um want to do that yknow so if anything it made me want not want to do it yknow because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army and uh when i got my notice hes like three years older than me yknow and hes so i mean it dont theyll draft you theyll put you on the front line i said well im going to enlist in the airforce anyway so 

Recording: (122/ 8002) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emory and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start yknow try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because theyre like we already made it yknow 

Recording: (123/ 8002) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (124/ 8002) 
they werent even allowed to believe in god 

Recording: (125/ 8002) 
im really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem yknow and so for me thats like okay come on i dont really want i dont want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff i just wanna get going and do the rest of this stuff so 

Recording: (126/ 8002)

Recording: (132/ 8002) 
like 

Recording: (133/ 8002) 
ive lived 

Recording: (134/ 8002) 
yeah it is its nice it works out well 

Recording: (135/ 8002) 
you were you had to go home because mother was ill 

Recording: (136/ 8002) 
that and i imagine thats about half and half right now or maybe its more on this side i dont know so i think that that really is uh in evolution at this time tell you the truth whats gonna cause the world to end i think what they really mean by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way its being run or the way its being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing theres a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very but its very very hard thing to accomplish especially when youve gotten into this like he said me me me and i gotta have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in my own home ive been a collector now i take this back to the depression years when i didnt have anything and my father one time when he was out of work guess what i dont know what welfare agency it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first doll baby i ever had and i remember when i uh tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water and when my mother said well if you dont know how to take care of any better than that ill never buy you another one and believe me she didnt 

Recording: (137/ 8002) 
yep yep theres a big water area its something to do with the little mermaid or whatever but they really enjoy all that we try to do as much as we can with them outdoor type of thing we do a lot of camping we do a lot of vacationing we try to go two times a year at least uh her parents live in cape cod so they 

Recording: (138/ 8002) 
uh to we never used the word ever <laugh> but um im sure plenty of people used the word on us you know <laugh> but we uh we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but um in terms of government i dont we werent ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would <laugh> go along with her yknow but um if a if a we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would very and i then in the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life it was 

Recording: (139/ 8002) 
we start them over again they have never learned and reason why youre throwing out carrying out too much in front of them without saying hey you gotta do this to prove this to me no we we we lack uh one heck a lot of ethical moral standards in this country were losing it every day and until we start looking at ourselves in in the mirror at night and say im proud of myself im proud of what i did i may not have made a dollar today but i understood somebody today

yeah um yeah i its hard because i i do come im a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i dont like i said im not gonna condemn them um at all like i said i have friends it i understand what youre saying um but i think thats something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out that maybe that child um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student ensemble um uh itd be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way um just because if youre gonna teach it to um a large amount of students im not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them probably be making cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i dont 

Recording: (209/ 8002)

Recording: (227/ 8002) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom from that as long as youre listening to them uh some people i dont care what their age was they just blew them off uh and so that plus you have they i think a understanding of um the schooling they came from um

oh it was on saturday 

Recording: (251/ 8002) 
well yknow my and my girls there are certain products that brand name like uh one of them i know is the meijer uh pudding that you can uh take for lunches which they do and its like edventure yknow adventure but its edventure well every once in while hunts will be the same price and theyll be a coupon in the paper so joyce will or joyce or i we we trade she goes the grocery store once then next two weeks i go and the next two weeks she goes so um shell uh yknow shell buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes and i go why are you buying that and she goes it was cheaper than the meijer brand and then when we eat it its like its too sweet yknow or its too overpowering or too sugary and the girls even they the same way they would go we dont like this its too chocolatey so yknow like the manwich stuff its like they just pour sugar in it i guess because thats what people like and so i find that the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but its all like a meijer brand or something like that or food club or something like that 

Recording: (252/ 8002) 
well i think sometimes that its because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown ive always been the kind of person to believe i never told my kids not to do something that i myself was doing examples smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner saying no youre not old enough but i can now there are some things that the kids cant do at this age that somebody can at another age possibly like go out on a date for example well hes going out that party why cant i well hes already sixteen years old now wait till youre sixteen years old and youll be allowed to go to parties because by that time ill expect you be able yknow know what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and i know <laugh> well i wont give you any examples but anyway if if i told them they couldnt do it i would try my swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl uh but anyway i would always and i would apologize if they did catch me doing something that ive been telling them no you cannot do i would apologize say mommy was bad and mommy did that i got soap in my mouth one time because i did that <laugh> well well um oh no i mean now if you want to hear the story its funny well deviate just a teeny bit i was baking a pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie one those that can get juicy sometimes and i hadnt put any aluminum foil or anything underneath there to catch it and just as i started to get it out i spilled it and i said a bad word yknow and just as i said that word leaning down here heres two little shoes <laugh> 

Recording: (253/ 8002) 
well i do think access is too easy but its sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so yknow just beside themselves that it would i dont know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be yknow doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here theres too much of a in my opinion yknow theres too much of a gun culture i mean over there theyve pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that yknow of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously englands such a small country in comparison but i mean thats just amazing to me and but its true i mean the fact that yknow the access is just theres almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of yknow in conversation talking about oh yeah i yknow getting a gun for security and all this stuff its like yknow what your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of yknow happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who wasnt yknow i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (254/ 8002) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (255/ 8002)

Recording: (257/ 8002) 
think what 

Recording: (258/ 8002) 
as uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something <laugh> she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were 

Recording: (259/ 8002) 
oh okay 

Recording: (260/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (261/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (264/ 8002) 
yeah <laugh> i dont really have any childhood recollections of california yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (265/ 8002) 
no because um all the kids take that california achievement test i dont know if youre familiar with that and its like yknow because its say like you and i go to school you go to you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus and we both make straight as well when you take the california achievement test that really the as mean nothing because its like lets see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those because yknow they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh its so look how bad their test scores well yknow if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i dont know what it what it would be but lets just say its uh brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad in probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so they live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobodys there to yknow im not a uh yknow like an ogre or anything but yknow i always keep tabs on my kids yknow like ive always gone to conferences even though they got straight as i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i dont come then its like saying i dont really care so i always go so they know that im keeping tabs on things and i dont demand as i just demand them to do their best and i said yknow if your best is a c then thats what it will be but i said if your best is an a and youre getting a c you got me to talk to so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight as and when they take the um what is that thing the proficiency test zoom through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have uh this probably sounds really biased or bigoted but then you have the kid whose mom and dad arent together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes proficiency test he gets like a th=thirty 

Recording: (266/ 8002) 
oh itll be 

Recording: (267/ 8002) 
no where north land is 

Recording: (268/ 8002) 
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or the other 

Recording: (269/ 8002) 
i my my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said were closing next year and it was hard but yeah once its reached the point thats decision is made and announced and i mean there were good reasons for it um and they explained the reasons and ya know at some point you have to figure out how much do you wanna fight something when its inevitable 

Recording: (270/ 8002) 
the mustiness the old 

Recording: (271/ 8002) 
you dont have too many options yknow 

Recording: (272/ 8002) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they didnt know i was gonna do this so after they get all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no ad libbing no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote 

Recording: (273/ 8002)

Recording: (276/ 8002) 
and none of the other coaches did either 

Recording: (277/ 8002) 
and so it was kind of funny but but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that dont have any hope and 

Recording: (278/ 8002) 
yeah well yeah yeah i mean it happened a lot and um ive had two abortions one illegal and one legal and 

Recording: (279/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (280/ 8002) 
oh george oh w i dont know i havent really formed an opinion i cant 

Recording: (281/ 8002) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot 

Recording: (282/ 8002) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kids gonna hate you 

Recording: (283/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (284/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (285/ 8002) 
like i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 

Recording: (286/ 8002) 
yeah theyre very quantitative as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually thats why i dont like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly theyre like oh it doesnt matter how you treat people and then its all about the bottom line well theyll in my opinion theyll end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover things like that then and if you have a product and that because obviously people arent gonna care yknow so and they theyre they seem very closedminded like like this is the way business has to be but the professors dont seem to be necessarily like that maybe im coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (287/ 8002) 
they didnt they didnt bring that up he only gave ten cents 

Recording: (288/ 8002) 
now what thats industrial nuclearonics or something like that think about now you got the wetlands down there yknow where are kids gonna go 

Recording: (289/ 8002) 
take them to the grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but and i dont do it as regularly now because of the advance in age yknow 

Recording: (290/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (291/ 8002) 
well is there any kind of yknow training i mean do you are they doing like the whole job training after the two years or during the two years 

Recording: (292/ 8002) 
so theyre kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent thats kind of how its divided out between the projects 

Recording: (293/ 8002) 
<laugh> yeah 

Recording: (294/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (295/ 8002) 
yeah yeah i dont i dont know but it then then they second guess the mother and she risked her life and all and they they cant do that i mean yknow its too bad that yknow she wasnt there to to go on with what they were planning on doing but its not our right to to take other countries kids even i mean thats another thing i mean come to america well take everyone and every yknow but then we have all these this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean thats all theyve grown up with is the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they cant make it then theyll just bomb somewhere and then <laugh> but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that yknow you uh you kind of wanna do a study of how long theyve been here and yknow thatd be interesting um i think theres gotta be a line drawn and i think that um yknow if theyre if theyre caught um and and its any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back but um i just think that were just too open with that and theres gotta be a line to say this is as many people as as we care to yknow i mean and i know thats hard but and its hard to draw the line but then other countries if its so miserable there then they need to work on their country because 

Recording: (296/ 8002) 
thats fine

Recording: (305/ 8002)

Recording: (310/ 8002) 
oh yes theyre getting better though they really are theyre much better now than they were twenty years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example

Recording: (321/ 8002)

no humans are violent by nature i believe mean people have been at war since the beginning of man its more or less greed that causes violence its not media media just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do tvs showing you violence that you could do if youre driven to it 

Recording: (328/ 8002) 
and you can hit the road if you want of course the only thing he had was nothing

Recording: (331/ 8002) 
yeah those are nice 

Recording: (332/ 8002) 
um honestly i cant say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it doesnt bother me at all its just something i dont wanna deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean two people of the same sex are living together married or whatnot that doesnt bother me like i said its just more something that i dont know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot its i think its just more because its so different than like what you normally see or things like that 

Recording: (333/ 8002) 
uh shes grown uh uh she yeah shes expanded her horizons if you will and 

Recording: (334/ 8002) 
and uh as with a lot of the resentment thats felt that i experienced toward americans rather saddeningly i think our culture is starting to really infuse itself into europe at least i mean i see instead of us becoming more like them yknow them becoming more like us walmart has bought yknow a big uh retailer there so 

Recording: (335/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (336/ 8002)

Recording: (339/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (340/ 8002)

Recording: (342/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah and then my other sister just recently got divorced um this year or i guess it was um final end of last year and shes got two kids and raising them and so theyre all um most of them except for um linda and bobby bobbys the one in uh connecticut and lindas in akron but everybody else is within ten minutes of each other 

Recording: (343/ 8002) 
gotten somewhere else 

Recording: (344/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (345/ 8002) 
none of it i mean its kind of the traditional light at the um uh uh like a big tunnel with a bright light at the end or uh they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene uh um seeing a dead relative something like that 

Recording: (346/ 8002) 
been highly critical of of organized religion

hm 

Recording: (359/ 8002)

Recording: (360/ 8002) 
i do not like bussing <laugh> i just dont um i think its its kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (361/ 8002) 
well i think in general like lets say if you took a handful of executives from borden or a t and t or someplace like that you would probably find that in general theyre very concerned 

Recording: (362/ 8002) 
yeah but um just to see the church might be fun um we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worship center building and because we were really too too big for the sanctuary that we had 

Recording: (363/ 8002) 
no i dont fear none of the kids 

Recording: (364/ 8002) 
yknow they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and thats thats the bottom line and its sad but theres so i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we ended up settling for 

Recording: (365/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (366/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (367/ 8002) 
because they got beaches and and yeah <laugh> yeah i its like i dont think lake erie can compare i would hurt

Recording: (376/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (377/ 8002) 
which one is that 

Recording: (378/ 8002) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully theyll be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something shes going to have the rest of her life um ill tell you what with todays world and some of these fourteen year olds that look like theyre twenty and you know they they know what theyre doing and no they shouldnt keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved id say to the age seventeen maybe you know i think they should have a parents consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake its going to be if shes gonna be young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother yknow i mean theres a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them yknow and theres so much that for a while there that was going on and its like you i cant believe these women are doing this yknow they just snap <laugh> 

Recording: (379/ 8002)

white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i dont know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean theres money involved but its its not so much money that it would radically change your life in a sort of yknow its not thousands of dollars if it was two hundred i believe and and thats yknow i mean if if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i dont know i think yknow there is the debate about ten years down the line but yknow is there going to be something thats going to make them change yknow what is it yknow what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for yknow what percentage i mean i dont know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice its a lot different than yknow the government saying okay this is your cut off limit but i mean the statistics they were giving on um the average number of children that these women were having and yknow yknow the average number of children that were just taken to the hospital and left there or yknow just dropped off wherever and and the state these children were in and their lifespan and everything else i mean yknow theres the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the the childs life yknow i mean i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and yknow the same is in england yeah everyone saying oh because they were talking about yknow i mean again was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of yknow somehow sort of forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control yknow in whatever way and and again that everyone was up in arms but its sort of like yknow what is that childs quality of life gonna be when their mothers just yknow

Recording: (695/ 8002)

Recording: (696/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (697/ 8002) 
id say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i dont think that you can say everything yknow you have everybody has do this because yknow people are individuals and you have to take that in to consideration i think so 

Recording: (698/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (699/ 8002)

Recording: (701/ 8002)

Recording: (704/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (705/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (706/ 8002) 
and i dont really think its something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like what do they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i dont think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i dont know what i grew up in but ill ill give an example i didnt grow up in lets say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music doesnt mean if somebody doesnt do that theyre not okay i think that would be a good idea or yknow cultures all are different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or do yknow what i mean that that is something different um accept the people you dont have to like what theyre doing but theyre still people so 

Recording: (707/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (708/ 8002) 
i think its important to know what the persons values an customs are and to support whatever it is an if i mean weve done some wild things over there but i mean its i mean weve changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed uh face the north star or uh they needed to have this thing above the bed or under the bed and i mean if its important for them to have prayer then i think its important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (709/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (710/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (711/ 8002) 
but its not gonna work i mean they if youre around people i mean number one theyre around their parents and their siblings and thats socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean youre around people and youre around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that ive read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and theyre not relying so much on their peers and their peers opinions because i i for one example the pokemon craze my son didnt know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and yknow its just like stuff like that its just like they dont they dont know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face yknow and then even still theyre just like oh its cool because everybody else likes it they dont really know what it is or what its about or i mean <laugh> yknow what i mean because its like now they just blow up each other or whatever its like really what is the point to the whole thing and he didnt know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it wasnt cool so that was my our influence on him rather than the peers influence on him 

Recording: (712/ 8002)

as a teacher how would you how could you cut down a student and say no thats not the way it was and its nothing youre learning from a teachers guide no but how do you know if i ask in the first but its a matter of tradition of handing it down to the tradition itself its a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way and its its not necessarily written down but its passed on those days probably written down or not written down but verbal and extended and so its that hand down from generation 

Recording: (924/ 8002)

he says i didnt 

Recording: (1044/ 8002) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (1045/ 8002) 
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but hes a bigot too <laugh> a racist yeah so 

Recording: (1046/ 8002) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um yknow what you spend on things and then theres a form you fill out and how much you have if youve taken any depreciation yknow you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then theres the percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then its just taxed its just not its really not that hard 

Recording: (1047/ 8002) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (1048/ 8002) 
well yeah 

Recording: (1049/ 8002) 
actually i do wasnt even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her oh this sounds cool yknow i had thought of myself as a uh a chemist for a long time and that this opportunity came up yeah id applied to like other places and i got into university of chicago and i wanted to go there and then this came up here and also i mean its just ridiculously cheaper here i didnt want debt after undergrad thats just pathetic um my counselor just kind of found it and hed posted it and he specially um tried to notify the national merit people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princeton right now yknow and theyre all off at their ivy leagues like basically working their butts off to get in when im already in i dont totally understand it 

Recording: (1050/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (1051/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1052/ 8002) 
i never learned math <laugh> we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables he had a big pizza party planned for 

Recording: (1053/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (1054/ 8002) 
yeah so thats taking some running around 

Recording: (1055/ 8002) 
no no im im interested 

Recording: (1056/ 8002) 
um i think uh some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you dont feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i still go through that i think we all go through that at some point or other even yearly for some of us um so im just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and didnt have that blind eye i think thats part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your childs eyes you need to really admit it um i mean you dont wanna do that but 

Recording: (1057/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (1058/ 8002) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home

yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky to run across her 

Recording: (1061/ 8002) 
and theyre not accurate 

Recording: (1062/ 8002) 
even harder 

Recording: (1063/ 8002) 
which i think is kinda nice so i it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just wanna have a room to all myself yknow i dont wanna go some place where im gonna have to like deal with somebody else in there so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home 

Recording: (1064/ 8002) 
so shes very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that uh so shes basically disabled and that goes when they do that its because of your education and also they take into consideration and everything 

Recording: (1065/ 8002) 
really um-hum i think its really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (1066/ 8002) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if youre aware of everything thats here you still in the back of your mind you just have that its its just columbus its just columbus ah maybe its because um people dont take advantage of dont realize whats actually here um dont realize how it i mean yeah its not chicago its not new york its not san fransico theres a lot of places its not but its ah yknow its not a backwater either well they need to get out more <laugh> i mean yknow all this oh well never be a major league city until we have major league sports well yknow i guess um getting out more wouldnt help those people its um ah that that would be yknow that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and um im pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just id im i really do think people dont take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (1067/ 8002) 
thats true 

Recording: (1068/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1069/ 8002)

Recording: (1070/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1071/ 8002) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till theyre in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then its always been a woman

and one of them theyd looked at in columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well gifted children you have the high uh one of the highest drop rate of out rates in schools theyre not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this moneys uh my feeling is you know theres lot of programs in school theres sponsored by the federal government particularly uh to help the the students are that are behind and thats important 

Recording: (1110/ 8002) 
when theyre giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone whos making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i dont care if i get five dollars that wont even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it 

Recording: (1111/ 8002) 
you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided its gonna be the one that runs the show well then thats when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm 

Recording: (1112/ 8002) 
sure um i grew up in lima ohio and which is only about an hour and half from here north i came here in nineteen ninety one i believe here being columbus um i got married about three years ago and right now im in the process of doing a little bit of everything ive worked all my life um until about the past two years and ive just been working like part time and um doing crafts and things like that because ive always been like in the financial analytical end and the other side of my brain wants some work 

Recording: (1113/ 8002) 
so we did it its well hes always had some problems its um his problems staying focused on things unless its something hes extremely interested in then you cant get him away from it um if its something he its the just an example in school he would sit there and hed be rolling around on the floor and stuff while theyre trying to teach something in class or working on a writing assignment or something and half hour to work on it hed be the last five minutes the teacher say you know you really need to get that done hed sit down and write it the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and hed could do it that quickly um i think hes lost ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade the school he went to was an open classroom and uh he had been through some couple the traditional schools already and the principal said we had told the talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him staying focused and she said well we can work with that well about halfway through the year she says its not working and they have an arrangement and with and i doubt if most the people in the parents in the school are even aware of this with childrens hospital the counseling center they set a room aside and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students its open classroom its experimental so theres people coming and going all the time and no but how we were never aware of it i i doubt if most the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him and he was they were the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about and said he was the counselors said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but if came time to answer the questions he knew every answer so he said he that they decided not to precede at that time because this is frustrating too it was our wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week but that was unusual and he wasnt a bad kid 

Recording: (1114/ 8002)

are they but they all look alike 

Recording: (1177/ 8002) 
uh they uh stopped federally funding uh o s u that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and yknow some people moved like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years til i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i dont want to uproot my daughters out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well ill just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (1178/ 8002) 
so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i i would uh call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i dont know i couldnt tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (1179/ 8002)

uh-huh <laugh> 

Recording: (1191/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1192/ 8002) 
thats true 

Recording: (1193/ 8002) 
youre talking to people all over the country and i mean youre becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world and 

Recording: (1194/ 8002) 
oh my god 

Recording: (1195/ 8002) 
and they were in italy and europe and uh there wasnt the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think thats part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from from where i was probably is a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1196/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (1197/ 8002) 
i personally agree with that but thats just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i dont know i i dont think that theres one solution thatll fit every every child and every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so yknow obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms yknow so theyre gonna make that decision on their own i say just and and plus with the internet and everything they they have access to so much information and i think that it falls back on the parents still if youre gonna be a parent you need to be responsible and i dont think that its getting done 

Recording: (1198/ 8002) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (1199/ 8002) 
um up until march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home an then my grandfather whos ninety five got um ill and my aunt had to choose between my son and my grandfather and um shes watching actually my grandfathers doing quite well now but she um watched him so we now have him in a day care um in hilliard 

Recording: (1200/ 8002) 
yeah and 

Recording: (1201/ 8002) 
um in general i think i think the united states has a fairly well developed like class not like class structure in which you cant move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (1202/ 8002) 
all forty eight <laugh> lower thats right youve been to australia <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (1203/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (1204/ 8002)

Recording: (1205/ 8002) 
whenever he well i thought he was gonna be elected uh mayor too but he didnt there but i dont know what that was about but um uh yknow hes got his and their gonna reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes a mistake is saying labeling things racist that are not necessarily racist but anyway 

Recording: (1206/ 8002) 
wouldnt even think about asking 

Recording: (1207/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (1208/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1209/ 8002) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt a child i mean just because youre a black kid living with like a white family doesnt mean you cant still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean its the same thing with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean its no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i cant see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i cant see it being any 

Recording: (1210/ 8002) 
i have to get a job and support myself so 

Recording: (1211/ 8002)

Recording: (1212/ 8002)

grandview has its own school system too but 

Recording: (1214/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1215/ 8002) 
so it brings that and its uh like yknow theyre theyre not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools ill bet you theyre all about the same 

Recording: (1216/ 8002) 
um-hum um wow uh huh um-hum well i have i have two uncles that are southern baptist ministers <laugh> and it used to be when we would visit them in the mid sixties we would have to go i mean if you visit your relative if your relatives visit and youre minister minister you have to go to church <laugh> and uh but the thing is is southern baptist um service always has that period where youre

Recording: (1291/ 8002) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation that you can be converted to homosexuality and i personally dont believe that so it i yknow im not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i thats where this comes from but since i think theyre wrong <laugh> i think it should be my way and i think i think yknow i think the material should be there i think it yknow dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (1292/ 8002) 
huh um 

Recording: (1293/ 8002) 
im im gonna keep doing the same stuff yknow ill find some other kid somewhere else and ill have some time yknow my husband and ill have time together and i i always find some i always have a project yknow its like im always saying well when things slow down around here im gonna like right now i should be home counting money for the i i did a fundraiser for the the school and we raised um we just sell uh morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff and our sales are anywhere from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that sale myself but that also means that i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile so but anyhow im always saying when it slows down but then i always will find another project so and i rehab houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that so

Recording: (1420/ 8002)

right 

Recording: (1573/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (1574/ 8002) 
yeah i just renewed my certification certificate last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and thats kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason um i had one that just had a baby <laugh> and um they its an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once and i it was the algebra two another time but they expected us to at least expected me uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history <laugh> so really requires you to be well rounded <laugh> and i i like kind of like that um ive taught in a couple of other places um community colleges the college in newark i taught a chemistry class there and the community college which is in hillsboro but i taught at their branch and i taught a introduction an introduction to ecology class there an introduction to uh introduction to the arts it was called <laugh> and that was interesting it was those are its kind of an underclass of teachers they dont pay you enough to do that they pay you um per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour <laugh> so 

Recording: (1575/ 8002) 
but like to some people thats considered a city so i think its youre perspective inthat sense 

Recording: (1576/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (1577/ 8002) 
um he doesnt seem he doesnt seem to have any problem its always been yknow what ever she <laugh=wants> i know so far its worked out pretty well so yknow im sure in a situation like that things are gonna come up but well well deal with it 

Recording: (1578/ 8002) 
i think theres been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking him away from the the cousins i mean theyve the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs family well theres not much closer family than your father and that that that they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you dont agree with them or not um i i i it was very unfortunate the way it happened uh but i think the government should not let it go on as long as it had 

Recording: (1579/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah me and my mom are real close 

Recording: (1580/ 8002) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an o s u employee 

Recording: (1581/ 8002) 
yknow and and its just i think that that happens so often there are too many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when youre talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (1582/ 8002) 
about uh thirteen years i think my dad uh once he got through with his residency and everything we moved to mansfield and he joined a practice and weve been living there ever since um mansfields about id say fifty five sixty thousand people and ashland is probably about twenty five to thirty thousand people but um mansfield is sort of fascinating to <laugh> per capita murder rate in mansfield is higher than anywhere else in in ohio <laugh> yeah um its just its very industrialized theres the theres a lot of um a certain community that lives there that normally wouldnt live in a smaller city like that theres just a lot of theres a lot of crime in mansfield um theres a steel factory theres a uh not really theres all sorts of theres all sorts of of um industry in the mansfield area but theres a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed its its been there for a while yeah weve got the mansfield state reformatory where shawshank redemption was where shawshank redemption was recorded yep yep well i dont know if thats our claim to fame but but we do we do have that in mansfield but um ashland is a little bit more and a little bit more of what mat affects a lot more locates more of a its more of a um agricultural county um ashland city is right where i live its yknow i mean were like five minutes outside of ashland city but ashland citys the county seat for ashland county and um mansfield is the county seat for richland county yeah but everybody does everything in mansfield because theres nothing to do in ashland but uh the mansfield branch campus for o s us there well growing up in mansfield was um uh yeah it was really boring it was really boring um my dad was just getting himself settled into the community and and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while um most of my early childhood memories are from where where we lived in mansfield it was uh it was a real it was a real dont talk dont ask community mean you really didnt know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi they never came over so yeah yeah yeah we lived in a suburban area of mansfield sort of like the uh the the white collar area where all the people who were business men were getting themselves established so and then um we switched churches and also my dad opened up he he and his partner opened up another uh branch office in ashland so we moved to the ashland area about about eight years ago almost nine years ago and we moved to ashland to get half way between um dad is my dads not centrally located between the ashland office the hospital thats in ashland the hospitals that are in mansfield hes about he said its about a twenty minute drive from all the places he needs to be um actually yeah we live on an we live on an now we live on an eighty acre farm yeah weve gotten a nice big house a barn some tractors no animals well weve got a dog but but um its its a farm in the sense that weve got a barn weve got tractors we lease we lease some of the land out to a a farmer who who actually works in plants stuff no not to be on a farm no my dads a doctor <laugh> i 

Recording: (1583/ 8002) 
yeah nah because right now yknow because he knows how to hes hes learned id say he knows more than most kindergarteners so i dont even push anything we dont really have a set schedule right now and im just letting him be creative and yknow letting him help around the house and yknow just if i let him watch something thats educational based usually and i let him play on the computer well go to different websites sometimes to check out things and im amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because hes he listens to everything <laugh> 

Recording: (1584/ 8002) 
and he said even in the when he was in high school that they had they had police officers there so thats not like a new thing but he said youd have people with like knives and youd have people with fist fights but you like guns was unheard of you know and i think i dont know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh theyre people feel dejected in high school im sure of it you know like i dont i i didnt feel that way but id like in retrospect i look back and i thought you know im thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so traumatizing to them like thatd be so like for four years every day youre just like teased or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you im not justifying what they do at all but im saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (1585/ 8002) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposely tried to work close or do the back roads its nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or yknow where ive been working on back roads so its not that bad 

Recording: (1586/ 8002) 
well thats its competition to be earliest and the the federal governments trying to stay stay out of the states face and so again thats another one of those things that just live with it i mean theres enough of theres enough things to do and fight in were it life but thats not worth it ya know 

Recording: (1587/ 8002)

Recording: (1634/ 8002) 
thats what you want 

Recording: (1635/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (1636/ 8002) 
i mean dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time and i uh i would tip im my views are typically a little bit more democratic but im not too say that i certainly wouldnt vote um for the person that i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (1637/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1638/ 8002) 
um-hum at this point um im not uh im not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i wouldnt move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so uh such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah theyve threatened it um and if they dont pull their scores up um they will yknow 

Recording: (1639/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1640/ 8002)

um-hum and that hurt her to go she thought she was letting yknow neglecting me i was in 

Recording: (1644/ 8002) 
<laugh> plus i dont really feel like the republicanpartyrepresents the populace at a whole like at their last political convention like in uh the last presidential election in ninety six they said one in ten of the delegates that were attending the convention were millionaires now granted i know more than ten people and not you know what i mean sotomei just feel like thats not a good representation 

Recording: (1645/ 8002) 
yeah so 

Recording: (1646/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1647/ 8002) 
of the thing is theres things you cant explain 

Recording: (1648/ 8002) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (1649/ 8002) 
yeah im a democrat and ive never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always adored mark hatfield i didnt vote for him while i was out there was the weirdest thing because i thought he was a great republican <laugh> but i think uh personally mike coleman was good i ive met uh well <laugh> we had a diamond jubilee at the village and and coleman and teater both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i didnt think that there was much that much difference in them i think yknow she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but um i in terms of having a black mayor i think thats good for columbus i 

Recording: (1650/ 8002) 
al gore really doesnt entice me at all he claims he invented the internet <laugh> 

Recording: (1651/ 8002)

um-hum 

Recording: (1653/ 8002) 
i mean uh i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i couldnt do this couldnt do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i always think of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so yknow because the yknow they just i dont know how i got i sort of feel im mentally okay now but i dont know how i got here because ive been the other way it hurt me yknow and its well yknow 

Recording: (1654/ 8002) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah theres a lot there theres way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like okay ill go to europe 

Recording: (1655/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 8002)

Recording: (1668/ 8002) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1669/ 8002)

Recording: (1670/ 8002)

Recording: (1671/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1672/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1673/ 8002) 
freshman 

Recording: (1674/ 8002)

Recording: (1675/ 8002) 
i do have some relatives that are um step my stepmoms relatives that are there theyre actually members of the mormon church 

Recording: (1676/ 8002)

oh good 

Recording: (1680/ 8002) 
i just cant believe and they said they didnt even know what was going on 

Recording: (1681/ 8002) 
so thats yknow a lot of my decisions were based upon that 

Recording: (1682/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (1683/ 8002) 
for a m cs for um not getting hurt <laugh> she works at fedex and um her crew is always getting hurt mainly her 

Recording: (1684/ 8002) 
i think so i think so um its its so sad to see a girl yknow have so many options closed off now i dont mean its by any stretch that its a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she doesnt intend to make 

Recording: (1685/ 8002) 
well no she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if shes asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (1686/ 8002)

Recording: (1687/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1688/ 8002)

its like yknow like some of these places in florida kind like ruined by tourists yknow like fort lauderdale daytona yeah its like after after the kids get done <laugh> yknow they just like well yknow forget it its like i because um i used to when i was in in um like a freshman um i heard i heard like dont even go to florida because like they they do not want students <laugh> yknow they want your money but they dont like they dont like your they dont like yknow the the trash and and the whatnot that they bring

in the way of benefits 

Recording: (1692/ 8002) 
yeah so its its a really tough thing to do i mean you hafta be sort of organized and i dont know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traffic controller who couldnt youd be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but theyre not college educated and really intelligent but theyre extreme good at it and then the other people uh that i know of one that i work with on a regular basis he is got a masters degree and hes yknow he reads continuously hes always up i mean if you ask him anything about like whats going on on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but hes one of our weakest ones yknow and its um 

Recording: (1693/ 8002)

Recording: (1710/ 8002)

but to go see something like cats or rent theyd still charge you out the butt really okay 

Recording: (1712/ 8002) 
my bill collectors are the ones that scared of that 

Recording: (1713/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (1723/ 8002) 
um-hum

Recording: (1898/ 8002)

Recording: (1899/ 8002) 
yeah it was like freshman or sophomore year 

Recording: (1900/ 8002) 
oh yeah well i dont know <laugh> 

Recording: (1901/ 8002)

Recording: (1902/ 8002) 
what were animals 

Recording: (1903/ 8002) 
yeah i would id say yknow life application things would definitely need to be part of it i dont think that you should throw out english or math or yknow cant believe im saying this history but <laugh> i dont think you should throw out that stuff but i dont think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on youre own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that those other 

Recording: (1904/ 8002) 
then then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (1905/ 8002) 
uh its a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot in there how hot who knows but its been such a strengthening spiritually strengthening thing it also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat um it gets all the crap out of you 

Recording: (1906/ 8002) 
oh boy like action oh fight the bad guys yeah and now its uh yknow like looking sort of postulating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metaphor for things in real life uh and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and upon our culture i think its kinda interesting and now that its coming back out uh i mean i look at things from a little different perspective but i mean yeah of the maybe i think ive done about ten twelve paintings of which im like consider to be done and and like 

Recording: (1907/ 8002) 
yeah and i dont know if its quite that bad but <laugh> but it was certainly some things that hes been doing that arent arent approved of and im not real up on that so 

Recording: (1908/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1909/ 8002) 
all right 

Recording: (1910/ 8002) 
then would be with a black president and i think it would cause problems um i dont know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see here definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (1911/ 8002) 
with six normal kids because l d kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1912/ 8002)

Recording: (1920/ 8002) 
<laugh> yknow we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying im not in for the yknow george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and whos not but i dont think gods gonna come down and do that so well yknow what i mean we cant really decide that but to be honest im for it um it doesnt have to be well im not even sure tubes tied is is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year thats still not still much cheaper than them having kids um and then if they id give more money if theyd clean up their act just for them um as far as it being racist i dont think i think theyre missing the the point because im sure theres some runaway white teenage girls out there too or mexican or what not um 

Recording: (1921/ 8002) 
yeah i got a son hes a senior at otterbein

Recording: (1935/ 8002)

Recording: (1942/ 8002) 
yeah and uh i had the prerogative i coulda gone somewhere else and made more money yknow but well what the bad part was is universitys trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing yknow you do you had step raises and everything so it least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1943/ 8002) 
id say its not any different than having a man i mean its a person shed just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (1944/ 8002)

Recording: (1947/ 8002) 
uh she was through with her pregnancy but she did end up just going to a public school 

Recording: (1948/ 8002) 
uh essentially all the big academics most the uh its actually all over the world its international 

Recording: (1949/ 8002) 
you be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks 

Recording: (1950/ 8002) 
i dont understand that 

Recording: (1951/ 8002) 
i think its really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids dont like being on medication because it makes them different they dont look at it like gee im really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look it like well none of my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it yknow <laugh> they look at it like its a big pain because they gotta run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting theyre time released ones theres only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty percent of population most people try the time release and it wears off and it doesnt do what its supposed to so they go back to the six hour dosage yknow one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then theyre late to the lunch line and yknow they just hate it so but it isnt something they can a lot of kids will not i guess theyre in denial just like we would be they say it doesnt help me i dont need it but when you sit down and say okay what are the things youre able to do when youre on it that you really have trouble with when youre off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1952/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah mm i think it couldve i thought shed get a better education out there uh now at saint louis school public school district she probably district she probably wouldve had the same as here but by being kirkwood yknow and relatively small and everything um i think we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class yknow so uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it yknow uh then i wouldve at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1953/ 8002) 
yeah i mean getting a gun doesnt i mean i was surprised like i would ive never owned a gun but im i think its pretty easy to get one actually 

Recording: (1954/ 8002) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1955/ 8002) 
no he didnt he didnt 

Recording: (1956/ 8002) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote thats the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing id do is register parents because many of them dont vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country doesnt even begin to vote until theyre forty if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i couldnt vote till i was twenty one and i was upset yknow because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i couldnt uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that yknow worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if id known that they werent gonna vote at eighteen and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty i wouldnt of i wouldnt of wasted my time um but anyway um you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age 

Recording: (1957/ 8002) 
i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and cant you have to shave and um you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can unless its really hot theres its different also depending on the climate

without going into too much detail um one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine and theological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he doesnt and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heretic and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i didnt want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were iming each other and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him yknow im like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh yknow talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds theres a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that but thats not what youre thinking youre thinking youre looking at me and youre knowing within your mind hes evil hes wrong and i said thats not right dude i i honestly dont know uh people get really scared theres certain i mean like theres certain denominations that will take one its sort of like the outer limits theyll take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to crystal clarity and theyll just run with it and thats what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of shes not part of it any more denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apostolic christian church were talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the sermon is read in three different languages some really wacky stuff

Recording: (2000/ 8002) 
one thing okay go head well i one thing um i was thinking yknow that i have a perspective on that maybe lots lots of people dont is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (2001/ 8002) 
so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so im to im up to like ninety four right now and i figured that would be a decent i mean it translates over because were on semesters it will get all messed up there but its its like im half way to three fourths done with uh with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now would be like because i after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits wont transfer over it would be a waste of time because most places dont like to take more than half so thats why i just figure right now i should look 

Recording: (2002/ 8002) 
yeah and yeah so i 

Recording: (2003/ 8002) 
well i met a lot more different cultures seen how a lot more different people live and found out how lucky i was

Recording: (2013/ 8002) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way doesnt mean its the right way and um yeah yknow i really struggle with that because <vocnoise=i> i come more from i think the family should teach it but lets be realistic how many families are gonna do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um <laugh> sound like my dad but it seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids shouldnt be

Recording: (2048/ 8002) 
which i feel has been completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh ive inherited this world where there was of uh uh where am i going with this <laugh> um i mean the generation before us had like vietnam and protested against it i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about yknow and im not being clear so im not exactly sure where im going with this i very cynical of uh about about the world ive inherited uh cause i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by fifty years of of you know like international politics sort of like propaganda um that says yknow like to be left of a certain point is bad like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like <laugh> almost like calling someone a communist in in the forties um where as im very cynical about that cause it they feel that it it wasnt it it its been a cultural process that has been developed and now im being handed this current situation which i see is completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical and the reason im cynical is because were handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the the the hypocrisy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but thats why im cynical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i dont know i feel kinda preachy <laugh> like this is my position 

Recording: (2049/ 8002) 
um i dont think that really matters honestly um i mean its i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts youre usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like and dont like um i cant see i cant see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone that they respect but i cant say that theyd be like oh well he does it so im gonna have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (2050/ 8002) 
yeah you just sit at the computer and key the data in or well the system were doing now is you can put in like um the address the u r l for a web resource it goes out and extracts data analyzes whats there and comes up with ya know subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it so ya know its its doing some of that some of that the automatic assigning and subject headings and call numbers thats thats a lot of re were doing a lot of research on that its got a ways to go its getting better

Recording: (2629/ 8002) 
i uh i say you should look what we did is we look in the newspaper and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years 

Recording: (2630/ 8002) 
uhhum 

Recording: (2631/ 8002)

Recording: (2632/ 8002) 
they get so theyre just so poor and they and and you i we felt sometimes like we could help them but they didnt want any help and it was kind of hard to just say okay well i did what i could and 

Recording: (2633/ 8002) 
and as the way i put it its kind of new agey and i dont like new agey stuff but yknow its the best example is moths from the dark when you flip on a light the moths will go right to it a child like that a young man like that is very impressionable very young still and uh these bad spirits will be flocked right to him 

Recording: (2634/ 8002) 
i cant see a lot of substance uh he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then sorta not really backtrack its just like its not anything really firm i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what the points they wanted to make and that i dont hear that coming from bush 

Recording: (2635/ 8002) 
yeah she did that yesterday 

Recording: (2636/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2637/ 8002) 
but the professors seem more centered to me theyre like you have to balance it which im sure is the truth yknow you cant diminish all your bottom line for yknow making your workers feel good but theres still something to it i think 

Recording: (2638/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2639/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2640/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (2647/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (2648/ 8002) 
yeah more yeah or more yknow i dont i dont even know because to start its just such a huge problem and its gotten so out of hand its gonna be everybody all together that has to work its gonna be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because were so concerned about elian this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but yknow you look at our own kids we dont even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean heres this little kid who still has a living parent and and i dont understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally yknow way out of line and 

Recording: (2649/ 8002) 
well hide in your basement i guess and i but i mean what you can 

Recording: (2650/ 8002) 
yeah well i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (2651/ 8002) 
because apparently they apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in front of their face and theyd be like dude that 

Recording: (2652/ 8002) 
even they dont get facts right a lot of time uh 

Recording: (2653/ 8002) 
yeah it is worth more what i cant understand is some people live in upper arlington and they send their kids to private school 

Recording: (2654/ 8002) 
well i havent read enough to know i i saw uh uh uh preliminary thing that they were going to protest and uh but i dont im not informed enough to give an opinion on that <laugh> 

Recording: (2655/ 8002) 
carrying a concealed weapon theyre gonna slap me on the arm

Recording: (2841/ 8002) 
i mean theres always been the nerds and um i dont know when i was growing up in the seventies there really wasnt punk or anything like that and i think um unfortunately i mean theres always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they just pushed you to an extreme certain kinds of kids and yknow they want a i saw yknow i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by a um a jock 

Recording: (2842/ 8002)

Recording: (2843/ 8002) 
when i started dating at almost seventeen um so no i think i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are um i i personally dont think a school can do it 

Recording: (2844/ 8002) 
word yeah 

Recording: (2845/ 8002) 
no but ive i have two daughters and two sons m and i heard my daughters talking about they want to do something special for my sixty fifth birthday so theyd given me a party on my sixtieth so i dont know what its going to be but i think theyll do they they talked about something in the way of a trip so maybe something the three of us can do together so im just 

Recording: (2846/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2847/ 8002) 
um i dont i mean there definitely is that image of yknow dallas and dynasty i think its its worse i think for the the image of the tourist like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded yknow and that was sort of another thing when yknow i went to school there is yknow i had a scholarship thats how i went there yknow and i worked the whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and yknow they just sort of dont grasp the fact that yknow you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films yknow i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pitt and juliette lewis and yknow theyre in the trailer and everything else and yknow their accent and and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like oh yknow something like is that what they talk like or is that what its like in the south and i thought oh my gosh yknow what an image to have of like the south and yknow i was just kind of shocked at this but i think that there yknow with yknow people who are going to university there and things like that there isnt necessarily that opinion maybe yknow in a certain sector like when all youve heard is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think yknow most people like me or whatever they well i shouldnt say like but yknow people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about it but yknow there isnt just that blatant view i mean i think that it is um the consumption thing like i think a lot more realize now that yknow i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like obviously when you give that a closer look so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said yknow across the board we dont even break even were like negative one or something 

Recording: (2848/ 8002)

Recording: (2880/ 8002) 
well i was with um im mormon so we i dont know if you have ever seen how they go two by two always and i was with what we call another sister i was and we would live in an apartment and we would pay for our own mission and there was a mission president and they had different people with responsibilities leaders and they would watch over you and make sure yknow call in the every night and check on you but it was really up to us what we wanted to do we were wed get up leave at nine thirty and be home by nine thirty or whenever it got dark 

Recording: (2881/ 8002) 
was pretty good never had to borrow any money never went on welfare didnt i think i was on food stamps or something for a month 

Recording: (2882/ 8002) 
yeah or yeah or yknow its tough when you know youve got kids that are doing softball soccer yknow all these events and yknow like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually drives from work to the softball and after that she home by nine so shes like i can see how you fall into this drive through window business yknow no but luckily yknow i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can find feed them and i can get them so thats how our life is mister mom 

Recording: (2883/ 8002) 
theres a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (2884/ 8002)

Recording: (2885/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2886/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2887/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2888/ 8002) 
opening of that tunnel and they fired a couple of our shells into the tunnel and then took off 

Recording: (2889/ 8002) 
and they had the strong uh public uh support over there its a really is tight knit community its uh quite different columbus needs to learn a lot from that area and uh its a matter of just uh putting in i guess your hands in the your practicing your faith which we 

Recording: (2890/ 8002) 
and thats so sad for our city 

Recording: (2891/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2892/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2893/ 8002) 
well is it 

Recording: (2894/ 8002) 
yeah so yknow his friend lives on the other side yknow its like a duplex and his friend lived on the other side and he uh he also was uh broken into they came through his bathroom window 

Recording: (2895/ 8002) 
very big <laugh> i probably down the line because like were still struggling to get up yknow <laugh> were waiting for that million dollar chec there that 

Recording: (2896/ 8002) 
so i almost bought one um uh couple weeks ago in fact i went <laugh> i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man whose it was for his mother who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest which is north and i made this this low offer and i never thought that they would i didnt want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was gonna get this house i should get it but i didnt really want now because of the baby coming and were gonna be busy and i didnt wanna get involved in and so i made this offer and then he countered back yknow i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he countered back at ninety six and i said that and yknow i thought well good now i dont worry about hes never gonna come to it so i wrote back and said yknow i appreciate your offer but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i i could do and i didnt even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2897/ 8002) 
uh wont lie there uh lot of happy strippers in town so or i should say exotic dancers 

Recording: (2898/ 8002) 
um i think its probably some of both i think its probably more but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i cant see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women but at the same time i wouldnt say theres anything too over powerful as fars the the number of guys being out there are violent i mean its something that unfortunately does happen but i mean its more how youre brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2899/ 8002) 
so now hes back into lawn care until something else better comes along 

Recording: (2900/ 8002) 
yeah i contributed to too many people theres too many people theres not enough committment its too easy to get divorced and it uh the competition i mean theres just tons and tons of um just people everywhere and young people today i dont i yknow i dont know what the statistics are gonna be but they i dont think they have a good idea of what marriage even is yknow before and also before a marriage was a committment to a a type of lifestyle and that lifestyles gone everybodys independent everybodys going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then might it might work but um i yknow and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (2901/ 8002) 
oh thats great <laugh> 

Recording: (2902/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (2903/ 8002) 
do do do 

Recording: (2904/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2905/ 8002) 
so i yknow they probably all hey you resemble that remark or ynknow 

Recording: (2906/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2907/ 8002) 
yeah but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they didnt ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and her mothers name was harriet 

Recording: (2908/ 8002) 
oh thats almost as bad as rosie cozy i have a 

Recording: (2909/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (2910/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2911/ 8002) 
every day the other one i dont see that much anymore 

Recording: (2912/ 8002) 
yeah medicaid i think i think it 

Recording: (2913/ 8002) 
theres no issue 

Recording: (2914/ 8002) 
well im lucky in that way because um i get travel a lot and it and so yknow if theres something i really wanna see chicagos not that far washingtons not that far um new yorks and i dont get to new york that often but um yknow i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i wanna go to the trouble 

Recording: (2915/ 8002) 
uh-huh his daughters twelve 

Recording: (2916/ 8002) 
well i think all through growing up theres always been yknow different kind of kids 

Recording: (2917/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2918/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2919/ 8002) 
<laugh> do you have a three oclock 

Recording: (2920/ 8002) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general or family 

Recording: (2921/ 8002) 
yep i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but um its amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they dont realize yknow their old guns that they confiscate and they dont realize where theyre going i mean that amazes me um but theres always gonna be the underworld and different ways that kids and people can get guns and its sad i dont know how we could ever limit that but theres so many millions of guns in the world that yknow youre wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but yknow you its like identification thing yknow 

Recording: (2922/ 8002) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the um sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (2923/ 8002) 
oh that was a football game deal 

Recording: (2924/ 8002) 
the thats why its mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2925/ 8002) 
yknow and they did want the children 

Recording: (2926/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2927/ 8002) 
thats true sometimes we have trouble finding enough violists or something yknow an instrument like that um but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for the last few rehearsals um-hum so we sort of have stringers i guess youd call them <laugh> yeah weve actually been on w o s u also uh radio on music um our recording last year yeah of beethovens ninth got on music in midohio <laugh> yeah we used the otterbein college choir um 

Recording: (2928/ 8002) 
hm 

Recording: (2929/ 8002) 
and come back in 

Recording: (2930/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2931/ 8002) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like yknow if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (2932/ 8002) 
um college wise i dont know anyone of college age thats gay 

Recording: (2933/ 8002) 
<laugh> time to go all right im done here <laugh> 

Recording: (2934/ 8002) 
oh i would be surprised 

Recording: (2935/ 8002) 
oh i hafta eat it thats like <laugh> 

Recording: (2936/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (2937/ 8002) 
right she just went there last year 

Recording: (2938/ 8002) 
uh uh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (2939/ 8002) 
um and you kinda knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that thats still thats still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um so i dont i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe theres a couple more things to do theres bigger more comfortable movie theaters and and that kinda stuff it hasnt really 

Recording: (2940/ 8002) 
but just that freedom yknow to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not and then its really clear but if you dont get that and youre always thrust back into it i dont think you can break free 

Recording: (2941/ 8002) 
because conceivably they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (2942/ 8002) 
right right well let me ask you ah about somebody else whos not that well known do you know john gorka have you heard of him hes really worth looking into hes hes funny he has good songs hes a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arlo guthry or somebody i mean he he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does acoustic and um he writes most of his own songs yeah and if you ever see something by him you should get it or if you see it in a friends collection ask to listen to it he has funny funny some of the songs are really funny and some of them are the saddest things youve ever heard yeah yeah <laugh> just just tragic things <laugh> um uh lets see funny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows <laugh> um lets see oh i cant think of too much of them right now but uh yeah 

Recording: (2943/ 8002) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that yknow you shouldnt sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then yknow you shouldnt do it 

Recording: (2944/ 8002) 
usually shes looking for something to eat yknow 

Recording: (2945/ 8002) 
theyve just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her and husband was having problems and my niece is uh eight well she was in fifth grade in theres a elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarettes and everything and i just am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (2946/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2947/ 8002) 
sophomore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my masters 

Recording: (2948/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2949/ 8002) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it doesnt really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean thats kind of a tough question to answer i mean its almost its something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that theyd be adopting um they obviously wouldnt know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (2950/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (2951/ 8002) 
but its mindboggling that its because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now youre talking two whole high schools two football teams yknow its just mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with you know know of hand full of people and dont know anybody else its like yknow a lot more of a tight knit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (2952/ 8002) 
sometimes i think its been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think its been very good because at least it lets us know whats going on in the rest of the world and if it werent for that some of the things we wouldnt know and i think that as you increase your knowledge youre far better off <laugh> than to stay in this little hole over here and this is all i wanna know about 

Recording: (2953/ 8002) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i dont know maybe even she sold drugs or yknow whatever kind of way she made her money but it wouldnt have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to 

Recording: (2954/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2955/ 8002) 
but he just didnt have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (2956/ 8002) 
that 

Recording: (2957/ 8002) 
everybodys 

Recording: (2958/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2959/ 8002) 
as much probably 

Recording: (2960/ 8002) 
how many times youve been in ireland 

Recording: (2961/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (2962/ 8002) 
i do believe i do believe and i think maybe ill ask you because youre one of the younger generation havent you as you have grown older havent you looked back sometime and said boy mom was right about that dad was right about that i think the older a child gets and that includes us too now that were our age because were im almost as old as my mother was when she died im older than my father was when he died i do believe i see now where just living life itd keep your eyes and ears open and your mind you gotta have your mind open to receive what your eyes and ears say i guess um you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school but theres a lot of things youre just not gonna learn except by actual experience and living life and i believe that thats a lot of it right there because i know i started to say a while ago and i dont think i finished it i myself have these wants getting only what i need versus all these little wants and desires because i grew up in the depression and didnt have these things consequently ive got a doll collection a teddy bear collection an angel collection record collection you wouldnt believe a whole one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room the books id started when the kids were little because they did read at home and that libraries were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and consequently ive kept the books and its amazing but some of those grandchildren almost all of them that come over the house said they get bored theyll go over to the book theyll go over that bookcase and theyll start looking for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent now however my one sons gone too far hes got one rooms completely lined with books and a hallway part of is books and i dont know whether the kids ever go and pick those up or not because theyre always going to the library so you see its what is taught at home that really count but we dont need all those material things and now im sitting back and thinking well which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are gonna keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money and travel <laugh> you see what i mean you change your opinions change as you get older and you begin to look back i dont think i was ever a spendthrift to the point that i did things foolishly some things i did do foolish but i mean on a over all basis 

Recording: (2963/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2964/ 8002) 
aw 

Recording: (2965/ 8002)

well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really doesnt motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students theyre probably gonna stay with that because its real easy life 

Recording: (3066/ 8002)

Recording: (3080/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3081/ 8002) 
i dont agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only thing thats gonna happen is its gonna trickle down and youre gonna have to listen to them being miserable and and i think its much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family thats miserable and they fight and then you feel like its your yknow people say its a my fault because this happened yknow and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i i cant imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i dont thats a totally different perspective just to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (3082/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3083/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (3206/ 8002) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give background on him and thats what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see whats going on when the medias only showing one side of the story i mean theres definitely much more out there thats going on than theyre telling you um so i really dont see a big problem with the way the americas going or whatever the youth um and like say i wouldnt say its any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they werent around for it 

Recording: (3207/ 8002)

yeah its usually like about a third or something um i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus its just basically getting out of the house 

Recording: (3219/ 8002) 
um-hum um-hum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they dont take time to raise their kids and establish the morals in the home and theyre just like oh well theyll learn it there whatever and the kids um theyre basic where they learn things is their peers they dont get it everything instilled at home thats pretty much what yknow ive seen talking to my husband and yknow and theres so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before theyre ready 

Recording: (3220/ 8002)

Recording: (3261/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3262/ 8002) 
no i dont see that kind of racism at all 

Recording: (3263/ 8002) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be so bad that it was something that i yknow what i mean and i knew better but you just yknow and its like well i wasnt that strong granted but i was probably the <cutoff=m=most> normal teen and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen yknow ok <laugh> eleven twelve its like ew he we even look alike <laugh> forget it but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (3264/ 8002) 
its its interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had made arrange she was at uh otterbein then she made arrangements that uh she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers so that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in or yknow its just too much stress for me to even think about <laugh> <laugh>

Recording: (3267/ 8002) 
thats the appalachia area yeah um-hum itd be great if somebody yknow they gonna want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government pumps money into an area yknow that tends to be like a uh foreign country gets it yknow and 

Recording: (3268/ 8002) 
huh 

Recording: (3269/ 8002) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (3270/ 8002) 
so its really weird because uh 

Recording: (3271/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3272/ 8002) 
um-hum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher im supposed to get an a whats wrong with you <laugh> whats wrong with you 

Recording: (3273/ 8002) 
um-hum no i feel funny that im i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but yknow it just just didnt work out yknow i was with his father for like nine years since i was sixteen and he just didnt grow up once we had him he didnt change like i changed and so 

Recording: (3274/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3275/ 8002) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (3276/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3277/ 8002) 
um there were one or two 

Recording: (3278/ 8002) 
but thats what i 

Recording: (3279/ 8002) 
yknow <laugh> 

Recording: (3280/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3281/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3282/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3283/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3284/ 8002) 
yes um-hum 

Recording: (3285/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3286/ 8002) 
i dont want either of these people 

Recording: (3287/ 8002) 
yeah hes a real nice guy 

Recording: (3288/ 8002) 
<laugh> yeah you should be were all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so yknow but you can tell how your childs doing of course 

Recording: (3289/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3290/ 8002) 
i had i had fun i enjoyed its one my my favorite classes actually for for an elective 

Recording: (3291/ 8002) 
im just more of a conservative person i mean im not sure exactly what his platform is but ive seen him speak a couple times and i dont know he just impresses me more than al gore 

Recording: (3292/ 8002) 
i think more what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really dont get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism youre still serving jail time and you get <laugh> you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases theyll even chain you up and beat you in public for it um i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that thered be a much less problem with it um i think just the fact that the jails are so over crowded now that they know that theyre gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone youre youre not even gonna get thirty days in jail and youre gonna be let go i mean thats an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (3293/ 8002) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom oh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and yeah it left marks but it and sure it hurt i mean it would sting and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up and ive ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids and none of us were injured none of us were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it wasnt something that truly injured uh now today however uh i suspect my mom could easily be could have been charged with abuse in fact child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that uh green its always a green switch because uh uh the eh old ones they would break you didnt want them break break <laugh> 

Recording: (3294/ 8002) 
yeah right <laugh> 

Recording: (3295/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3296/ 8002) 
oh thats right

yeah yeah <laugh> yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (3366/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3367/ 8002) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh thats the downfall of our society because were thinking more of ourself others and i think as as we become older you start thinking about how um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith its not the materialistic things that the university here uh professes to be the thing 

Recording: (3368/ 8002) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling hes going through who he yknow i ive went through that where yknow you you look at a woman and youre you shes attractive to you yknow but thats just something thats going through your mind and that i think thats like the devil getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or yknow or not drunk and just yknow i would just tell him thats something hes going through and thats wrong for him to do that that he yknow hes a man and i would tell him god didnt put two men on this earth and if he would choose to do that that i wouldnt hate him or disown him or anything like that 

Recording: (3369/ 8002) 
i went to o u for about three months but i just got out of school you know how it is 

Recording: (3370/ 8002) 
well as it turned out he expected us to play the solos <laugh> or didnt play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and um i thought it came out pretty well i have a recording of it for a while there i was worried that we didnt get a recording of it and i was really upset <laugh> 

Recording: (3371/ 8002) 
mm 

Recording: (3372/ 8002) 
hell yeah hell basically tell you he dont have no except for me 

Recording: (3373/ 8002) 
i do it so 

Recording: (3374/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3375/ 8002) 
here in columbus yeah ive ive always lived in columbus yeah 

Recording: (3376/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3377/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3378/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3379/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3380/ 8002) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (3381/ 8002) 
whats different my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle was i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but its there a block away olentangy village im right in where i always was i mean im i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities course im i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (3382/ 8002) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3383/ 8002) 
yeah well theres too many situations out there to have everybody fit in to certain ones that just everyone of thems different 

Recording: (3384/ 8002) 
south pacific yeah 

Recording: (3385/ 8002) 
its in in education its its top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business school is coming up like theyre building a new building but by the ill be gone by the time its done if i decide to stay so its itll be so as far as uh education like for small school and they just opened up their phd program in education and theyre also known for political science but its a real conservative political science its a real conservative school and that doesnt really match my my views on a lot of things um like they its dry they have uh real strict visitation policies things like that my thought is if youre if youre if youre considered an adult enough to move away then you shouldnt have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (3386/ 8002) 
and so thats a whole different thats real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (3387/ 8002) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (3388/ 8002) 
if if you didnt own lets say on a school levy and you didnt uh you you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and im very angry when people say well you dont hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up its built into the rent uh at least its it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord <laugh> uh and i dont ive never lived any place where my rent didnt go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct f proportion and beyond yknow uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing id say and then id also say that yknow uh because uh a a a number of reasons that people dont vote for school levies now is because they dont have kids in the schools yknow but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you dont have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or yknow the the university of virginia and believed in education yknow because he said without an educated citizenry you wont understand the issues yknow but its very difficult today to get to people um ive talked to some ive almost college age students and they dont see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and its not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it doesnt mean anything to them and i dont know why i wish i did but i dont know why 

Recording: (3389/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh yknow the parenting and everything yknow there was something missing in the uh uh the childs life yknow uh uh i bet he wasnt getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i dont understand how they could be building bombs in in their basement and mom and dad not know what was going on yknow i mean uh its just tragedy i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i dont know uh eleven years old or something like that well an accidental shooting him in him and the uh another friend of mine from the same same class yknow um he pulled a gun and shot him yknow and didnt know that the damn thing was loaded but and they were talking about another thing about that yknow where some kid i guess that happened just here in town uh couple about a week ago or something like that yknow where a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really yknow and whos really to fault and whos really at whos guilty i dont know uh id like to have uh not that theyd ever would have but if if one of the two that you that yknow if they would have survived id like to seen what was going through their heads yknow but thats something well never know 

Recording: (3390/ 8002) 
thatd be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (3391/ 8002) 
you could find it all over the place 

Recording: (3392/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (3393/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3394/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (3395/ 8002) 
and then there was another girl who i really didnt think was that smart shes kind of um inner blond and she got in <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (3396/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3397/ 8002) 
i mean whoo they said well since youre getting that why well cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under the apprenticeship program 

Recording: (3398/ 8002) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (3399/ 8002) 
just mount tapes uh do printouts monitor systems uh people have problems help solve them 

Recording: (3400/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i cant say that they be any difference with them 

Recording: (3401/ 8002) 
it wasnt a huge shock it wasnt my first encounter with homosexuality 

Recording: (3402/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but um yeah then i was living with my friend for awhile um but and then like now me and her and my other friend live in down on maynard 

Recording: (3403/ 8002)

Recording: (3424/ 8002) 
its very hard 

Recording: (3425/ 8002) 
um like i said itd just be the old generations with the black president where now itd be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think thatd be a bigger number

difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (3430/ 8002) 
well it depends i think id like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites um in the symphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems um because a lot of the people in that group are paid um um-hum i get i get paid its kind of semi professional aspect thing where you get paid per service but um lets see so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for with the amount of music that they want to do <laugh> and uh this last year we played a movement of the shuman concert piece for four horns and orchestra and i was a little bit flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule at the beginning of the year because its really hard to play and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody <laugh>

Recording: (3462/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (3463/ 8002) 
um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (3464/ 8002) 
yeah because theres no fear of being caught by the parents 

Recording: (3465/ 8002) 
ah probably 

Recording: (3466/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (3467/ 8002)

Recording: (3468/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3469/ 8002) 
being turned away 

Recording: (3470/ 8002) 
so thats thats frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i dont want either one of these people there should be a none of the above yknow if there was uh that option im sure a lot 

Recording: (3471/ 8002) 
that is 

Recording: (3472/ 8002)

Recording: (3474/ 8002) 
exactly 

Recording: (3475/ 8002) 
i dont think thatd change my mind about anything i mean i dont approve of his immoral behavior but it doesnt change the way he runs the country 

Recording: (3476/ 8002) 
it just just kind of instincts i guess yeah actually there are quite a theres an an a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and i go to la leche league and thats kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breast feeding is yknow a way to mother and nurture and feed and yknow it it meets all of these needs its kind of like its just yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum oh i believe it um-hum yeah well one of my la leche league leaders she has a p h d and she does a lot of reading and she said that she actually read a study that they did um for breast fed babies to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their i q is equivalent to uh a regular bottle fed baby and a baby exposed to lead poisoning its that much higher even so i mean its just given them that much of uh better head start on development so <laugh> 

Recording: (3477/ 8002)

i knew we i knew we wouldnt go into this too far before this before it came in <laugh> um-hum <laugh> yeah it has it has yeah exactly what you said i mean my dad my whole family are christians and before i left for college my freshman year my dad my dad knows me real well mainly because im doing almost a mirror image of what he did when he grew up uh aside from the faith that i have um im very much like him um he wrote out a list of seven things predictions for williams freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and had my bike stolen william will william will and the big one that i was gonna mention was william will either grow in his faith significantly or will go the exact opposite direction and i knew one or the other would happen because im the i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh yeah it was real fun real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm he still doesnt know it was me but <laugh> yeah <laugh> he still doesnt know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is which is fascinating um but uh yknow i mean our first day i walked in he said hey im tom you ever smoked pot before i was like no he said heck we got a whole year together and and im directly quoting that this the first thing he said to me that is the first thing he said to me no no hes not but um he and i uh he and i hung out a lot and yknow i knew that one of two things was going happen i was gonna follow him and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind doing them every time i doing every time i would have done them i would have known they were wrong or i was going to the opposite direction and i went the opposite direction i got plugged in with uh the some christian groups on campus made some christian friends and hung out with them and and grew a lot grew a lot in acceptance of other people i mean you dont really run into homosexuals in a small rural christian community and if you do they if you do you dont know it because theyll shunned out of the community so fast that its crazy but uh um where was i going with that okay 

Recording: (3537/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3538/ 8002) 
um-hum uh they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you dont want to do it most usually i just put location i dont want to go certain places uh 

Recording: (3539/ 8002) 
yeah like when i need things and i call him up i need diapers i need wipes i need twenty dollars yeah hes there for me for that financially yeah hes always been there for me 

Recording: (3540/ 8002) 
no i had no idea where he was uh and at the time my mother in law was in a nursing home had alzheimers and my father in law was in the hospital 

Recording: (3541/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (3542/ 8002) 
and it would take like years i would think to implement the programs successfully 

Recording: (3543/ 8002) 
um-hum life skills <laugh> 

Recording: (3544/ 8002) 
thats a like theres no theres not a lot you really you can really do with that <laugh> 

Recording: (3545/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3546/ 8002) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things i ran into architecture where i mean we only had yknow one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (3547/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3548/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (3549/ 8002) 
but its a uh smaller catholic school yknow within saint louis so 

Recording: (3550/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3551/ 8002) 
yeah its well basically its like a its about the size of a very small hotel room and then its got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub and theres like a they there like oh its aroma therapy which is a little box on the wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean theres enough room where people can come and sit down theres like a fold out couch bed for whoevers in there with you and then theyve got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after its born 

Recording: (3552/ 8002) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3553/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3554/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3555/ 8002) 
it was during school um youd go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior youd go in the morning and your senior youd go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually youre at the career center and then you go 

Recording: (3556/ 8002) 
and so i think ill probably end up changing i dont know what to itd probably be more towards the education line 

Recording: (3557/ 8002) 
i mean my the middle brother was always around he wasnt very social in high school so 

Recording: (3558/ 8002) 
and theres people like that today still you go but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh huh uh and uh sit down make a visit to them every week make it part of life and develop a friendship 

Recording: (3559/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3560/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3561/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (3562/ 8002) 
its just very comical i was just like uhoh 

Recording: (3563/ 8002) 
yeah okay 

Recording: (3564/ 8002) 
uh it turned him into a zombie 

Recording: (3565/ 8002) 
no commitment do these guys have commitment and you see the guys out there they wanna may go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe something whatever it is you ask each individual what is it drives you and thats the thing you i get so perturbed in interviewers they ask somebody and and somebody comes back and say you know what i mean yeah what did he no i dont get inside the guys mind and i dont what did he mean you know what i mean yeah no i dont know what you mean ya know play dumb it pull it out of them what do you mean uh michael red what do you plan on doing after school when i was growing up they used to give the grade point average in the major of this of the of the student of the student 

Recording: (3566/ 8002) 
a little bit of both i think i looked into some phonics i went to the library checked out some phonic tapes let him watch those cause kids love to watch things <laugh> and just reading with him and going over things and its its been amazing just to see its like the light bulb comes on and 

Recording: (3567/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3568/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3569/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3570/ 8002) 
good <laugh> 

Recording: (3571/ 8002) 
in your room its just like forty of any other kind its plenty 

Recording: (3572/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3573/ 8002) 
um-hum me too 

Recording: (3574/ 8002) 
yeah exactly you can bring that in house i think i mean i dont know i might go out like like we said and be completely wrong so 

Recording: (3575/ 8002) 
because that thats happened where hes like i wont do it again and and he did it again i feel like once a cheater always cheater to me yknow maybe maybe to the next woman he wont do that to but hes gotten away with it so many times with me i feel like he wouldnt really do it yknow 

Recording: (3576/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3577/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3578/ 8002) 
and ive got friends that do that and i just i dont i dont feel right i dont want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff thats no way huhuh <laugh> 

Recording: (3579/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3580/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (3581/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3582/ 8002) 
well hes uh exporting cars illegally 

Recording: (3583/ 8002) 
so were kinda doing that and then i figure im probably gonna wait tables at night <laugh> and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (3584/ 8002) 
i know those are hauls 

Recording: (3585/ 8002) 
well i live on the south west side and work in dublin i dont get to campus very much i get to campus but its usually up to the o s u stadium of the o s u stadium uh studios 

Recording: (3586/ 8002) 
um i probably would like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3587/ 8002) 
<laugh> youre doing fine <laugh> 

Recording: (3588/ 8002) 
oh sure 

Recording: (3589/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3590/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3591/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (3592/ 8002) 
but uh her mother stayed with us for several uh two or three years and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy 

Recording: (3593/ 8002) 
and it really isnt though because once because i think its actually its really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kinda i feel like i can get along with any people and so it doesnt really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobodys perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life <laugh> for everyone <laugh> 

Recording: (3594/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3595/ 8002) 
thats thats yeah its developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school its when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance doesnt take over till about age eight 

Recording: (3596/ 8002) 
thats a big growing period yknow from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers werent there and they had to clean and they had to start dinner and they hated it yknow i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think yknow kids lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents worked im not sure if the columbine if both parents worked but i dont think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no 

Recording: (3597/ 8002) 
okay so youre youre higher up there than i would be 

Recording: (3598/ 8002) 
you know like i told her its the way i was raised 

Recording: (3599/ 8002) 
i mean forty is like the limit 

Recording: (3600/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3601/ 8002) 
it is thats why i quit 

Recording: (3602/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3603/ 8002) 
yeah uh its it to me thats sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what youve done it what the kid did and you dont want him to do it again and let it go they suspended him i dont know course um i probably say this i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so its probably not the whole story yeah it it is 

Recording: (3604/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (3605/ 8002) 
see and i cant eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to las vegas with my and i we didnt really have it my mom didnt cook it at home which im kind glad she didnt um the smell of fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out into a rash i mean it was like a heat rash oh it started on my neck 

Recording: (3606/ 8002)

Recording: (3608/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (3609/ 8002) 
humum 

Recording: (3610/ 8002) 
yeah because i have a like a problem with um getting to know people yknow like im shy at first 

Recording: (3611/ 8002) 
theres a lot more in college college its seven nights a week 

Recording: (3612/ 8002) 
and uh it didnt hurt me none yknow uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors know its your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids dont have nothing to do in their neighborhood even and how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3613/ 8002) 
no <laugh> 

Recording: (3614/ 8002) 
um-hum and some conservative values too yknow that the republicans are supposed to represent but i dont think they they are doing a very good job of that <laugh> 

Recording: (3615/ 8002) 
yeah yeah i saw the patients in the morning 

Recording: (3616/ 8002) 
oh yeah uh 

Recording: (3617/ 8002) 
i know its connected to like yknow england because its like i guess thats i guess uh i maybe like england owned it once so that 

Recording: (3618/ 8002) 
i dont see any reason for it myself but uh thats interesting uh um yknow when they when the first when the uh when time began yknow according my uh what i believe in and everything yknow it was man and woman got married yknow and and reason they got married was because of procreation yknow keep the keep the uh population going uh i think thats the way it was set up originally so i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but um if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3619/ 8002) 
i its not a presidential candidate issue as far as im concerned but uh im

youre from where 

Recording: (3623/ 8002) 
they they couldve taken other i mean well they killed all these people off but they couldve youll put them into the background you have them do a couple of shows a season and then had yknow i dont know the adventures of uh oh agent spender and the hell whats whats her name but then they they killed off all those like supporting former xfiles associated people 

Recording: (3624/ 8002) 
none of this where have you been shit yknow 

Recording: (3625/ 8002) 
well i think its more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (3626/ 8002) 
well thats right now well a lot of it 

Recording: (3627/ 8002) 
<laugh> you have yknow like yknow the uh typical american tourist

Recording: (3631/ 8002) 
oh <laugh> well i was because i was gonna say when you were talking about traveling youll be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling i know um like my husband goes to europe and goes yknow he goes to california every month and and yknow he goes as little as possible but the point is if i if we wanted to be traveling he could be going a lot more a lot longer now he just goes for yknow a couple days at a time just to get back here because i dont like him to have to well and he doesnt wanna be away from us but your husband youll be in a position you can he can latch on to something where youll be able to have lots of opportunities to travel 

Recording: (3632/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (3633/ 8002) 
that its going to well it might make national news i just 

Recording: (3634/ 8002) 
and i understand that mentality now because i went back but ill tell you the reason i left was its gonna sound stupid but he took my teddy bear which i loved and had for not since i was a child but at least five years at that time and he just he knew i loved it 

Recording: (3635/ 8002)

Recording: (3639/ 8002) 
uh okay its is that silicon valley 

Recording: (3640/ 8002) 
no i worked at the library when i was a student 

Recording: (3641/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3642/ 8002) 
um sort of let them make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do where they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (3643/ 8002) 
uh uh okay wait you know where the schott is 

Recording: (3644/ 8002) 
yeah he 

Recording: (3645/ 8002) 
well theres been quite a change in attitude of the general public i as far as work women working away from home is concerned and uh i dont know im glad that my wife was able to work there at home well actually she worked in an office when our first boy was just small 

Recording: (3646/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3647/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (3648/ 8002) 
well and 

Recording: (3649/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those my father wouldnt allow it because uh it was integrated 

Recording: (3650/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3651/ 8002) 
no its not 

Recording: (3652/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3653/ 8002) 
its easy to <laugh> 

Recording: (3654/ 8002) 
its getting so congested its thats what i dont like 

Recording: (3655/ 8002) 
no and other towns just dont 

Recording: (3656/ 8002) 
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh when they were planning this thing and with uh with ohio state to uh yknow like have the schottenstein center down at uh down closer to downtown or or something like that and play half your ball games there or something like that but but ohio state dont need that yknow they got their own stuff so 

Recording: (3657/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3658/ 8002) 
well i dont think they should be responsible i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties yknow the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they cant do everything and yknow they just need really positive things when they do go to school and yknow i think teachers are a big part of it i really do yknow you remember when you have a good teacher and that youve learned a lot um and i think yknow through education because its hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then yknow its always have to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers dont make enough money and theyre overworked and all these big large classrooms and it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a clique together yknow would be hard for them to intervene and say say oh whats going on in your life whats your whats the problem you know thats thats not really should be their role but um if they care enough they should call the parents and say look were worried about your son he misses lot of school or hes starting to dress really ynkow i sometimes and it shouldnt be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just yknow turning against the norm of the society yknow and if they dont want to be in sports thats fine there are so many different things they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and yknow but um unfortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents cant do but in some ways its always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home yknow i mean 

Recording: (3659/ 8002) 
columbus public 

Recording: (3660/ 8002) 
oh

<laugh> um not to sound like a broken record but i really think its our uh backslide on on family units i think its too easy to stay and ive been married and divorced so ive unfortunately had that experience to me um that its too easy to get divorced um people dont really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i dont wanna say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important um because lets face it to to me love is a choice because theres times when i dont love my husband i wanna smack him and hes being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and lo and behold an hour later week later what whatever long it takes im in love with him again i mean really yknow what im saying and um i think its just too easy to get divorced i dont believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of a just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment um unfortunately i think thats the problem parents um are a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other yknow using the kid as a medium um or theyre too selfish and dont listen to their kids or they didnt i i dont wanna say selfish but lets face it like we said yknow even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um not spend enough time with the kids yknow theyre working what not and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that uh and i dont think enough families are doing that

that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like its chaos even though it seems like its an accident uh theres a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that theyre supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and thats one of the things i also learned through this was that you dont die you dont physically maybe yknow theres no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it wont

Recording: (4011/ 8002) 
yes to but that uh more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today its less than that because its a because of a loss of a parent or inability of a uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those those things do exist and they will always have some but thats a very small percentage though scott 

Recording: (4012/ 8002) 
yeah that could be right yeah 

Recording: (4013/ 8002) 
well and dont you think too the that the more they have found out psychologically speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the um throes of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the that experience from being one of eleven children raised so yknow you didnt have the advantages that 

Recording: (4014/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4015/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4016/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (4017/ 8002)

Recording: (4025/ 8002) 
hum 

Recording: (4026/ 8002) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (4027/ 8002) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i im thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing <laugh> although whats going on inside your head and your body isnt that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (4028/ 8002) 
for example so you should name her tamara 

Recording: (4029/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4030/ 8002) 
most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved in their with their kids than say our parents were as kids yknow 

Recording: (4031/ 8002) 
which kids 

Recording: (4032/ 8002) 
i 

Recording: (4033/ 8002) 
but at the same time its not like they had the intent to do it so i cant say anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that youd run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (4034/ 8002) 
that he didnt 

Recording: (4035/ 8002) 
well ive been see i wasnt much i my being here and my daughter being there i didnt really have the uh time with her that i wished i wouldve had yknow but uh uh her mother would yknow wouldnt did her all right and everything but i wished that i wouldve been more involved in her growing up and i think two people families are generally better yknow for not necessarily living being yknow its about being married and everything but 

Recording: (4036/ 8002) 
basically because the plans which the utilities had for our locations they could not provide to us because of the uh the vesture ruling so we had to go out and um do our own surveys become self educated through uh courses uh through a t t and through purdue university it was i think o u had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but uh the projects basically we were going from a um putting together a network itself and uh we had a you think of a party line system what they used call daisy chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to a data network and we got down to point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had dedicated pipe

Recording: (4056/ 8002) 
oh its just so the environment of course is incredibly beautiful um and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and um yknow i think its a much friendlier place and then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just dont have poverty well if anybodys in poverty in oregon its because theyve chosen to live a simple life its not a yknow because they cant get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregon is not that great but yknow they say in eugene that even the dishwashers have p h ds they <laugh> well the the um the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country

arent there other important roles what would those nuns be where would your mother possibly been if she went to catholic school i take it where would she have been if it werent for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for and they had a very important role for your development even though youre generation is removed 

Recording: (4059/ 8002) 
but im like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience yknow objective ways 

Recording: (4060/ 8002) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i dont think that theres anything violent or that theres anything wrong with them but at the same time its just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they dont they dont show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high schools like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that 

Recording: (4061/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4062/ 8002)

Recording: (4079/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4080/ 8002) 
basically uh its just the talk and stuff its not uh like you know what i mean uh im black im better or im white im better its its none of that 

Recording: (4081/ 8002) 
um its an ego trip thats all basically its like look i can do this 

Recording: (4082/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4083/ 8002) 
yknow 

Recording: (4084/ 8002)

Recording: (4085/ 8002) 
nope huh um 

Recording: (4086/ 8002) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california thats where that family i told you about was the and when he was or sixteen and he really wants to go back so well probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money i mean we dont need to have a ton but we just should be at least a little out of debt and so yeah <laugh> something 

Recording: (4087/ 8002) 
well the main thing is they never leave they dont they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest g p a of any college 

Recording: (4088/ 8002) 
they 

Recording: (4089/ 8002) 
a parakeet yes little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (4090/ 8002) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progression that needs to be made um i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago whos a fellow history major her and actually her brothers a fellow history major too and a friend of mine i dont know him all that well which apparently her family i mean shes shes double major in history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but theyve made it painfully clear that when it she shouldnt plan on having a career because shes gonna hafta raise children at some point which is uh thats not the way things should work in my belief uh and and the fact that its like the males telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean yknow i think an individual individual should have the choice but i feel i mean im concerned about a a uh like this push to the right thats sort of going on hoping its sort of dieing out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh i think uh uh weve reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (4091/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4092/ 8002) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (4093/ 8002) 
yeah the big things 

Recording: (4094/ 8002) 
uh huh 

Recording: (4095/ 8002) 
but when he did have something to do with him it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (4096/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4097/ 8002) 
oh yeah and thats normal we understood that we knew we knew a lot of stuff we were gonna we raised him to be very independent and i always said that were gonna regret this someday i said another ten years well be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent uh so it gets to point that when we were first married pretty it was hard to make it simple decision on anything yknow weve worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own or anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teachers said independent we said it said stubborn but its like even go to mcdonalds or something and he was didnt want onions on anything he if he ordered a a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and and tell them 

Recording: (4098/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4099/ 8002) 
so if you if you you cant you couldnt bring any any like pets back say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the states so you have to leave all those 

Recording: (4100/ 8002)

Recording: (4104/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4105/ 8002) 
its like youre doing interviews 

Recording: (4106/ 8002) 
on the spur of the moment id have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (4107/ 8002) 
oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months and uh and uh i went to the produce stand and i took my umbrella and of course it doesnt rain too <lauchmuchin> <laugh> california and i said oh im from oregon and i always think its gonna rain and he says well im from washington and i know its gonna rain 

Recording: (4108/ 8002)

Recording: (4109/ 8002) 
so if you want get to me two more minutes a play okay now you got another leg but the thing is let me ask you question how does that impact you if you cant be a priest arent there other important quote unquote roles for women in the church arent there other important roles 

Recording: (4110/ 8002) 
<laugh> i 

Recording: (4111/ 8002)

Recording: (4118/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4119/ 8002) 
i think i would say the same thing because uh um course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness and um 

Recording: (4120/ 8002) 
whys that 

Recording: (4121/ 8002)

Recording: (4153/ 8002) 
two years 

Recording: (4154/ 8002) 
thats good 

Recording: (4155/ 8002) 
think that that you with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing i think people are starting to look at it a little differently 

Recording: (4156/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4157/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4158/ 8002)

Recording: (4162/ 8002) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (4163/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (4164/ 8002) 
theyd uh heard it all before and they some of them had known me for a few years but uh i was told i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else i dont believe that <laugh> <laugh> yeah um-hum 

Recording: (4165/ 8002) 
i at this point i blame it on the administration um and the citizens of columbus havent i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levy you should never defeat a school levy 

Recording: (4166/ 8002) 
yeah theyd just kick him to the hallway he was either yknow in the hallway or in uh the office and and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions 

Recording: (4167/ 8002) 
and i couldnt walk at all 

Recording: (4168/ 8002) 
that makes it hard like if you got like a if like you and you got a family yknow yknow you take you if you you wanted to like spend the night on the town with your yknow with your family man thats that kinda like blows your whole budget for the year 

Recording: (4169/ 8002) 
um i have a class at um high school that its called grads and its like um yknow all the kids in there are people that have kids 

Recording: (4170/ 8002)

Recording: (4171/ 8002) 
okay well call me rachel and im twenty four ive got a two year old son hes just had his birthday um the thirty first so and i live by myself in a house and i work um at in the accounting department 

Recording: (4172/ 8002) 
which was a a going thing 

Recording: (4173/ 8002) 
you know what um actually i dont believe they have anything booked so far lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come in to their homes and things ive usually ive worked for different hotels where ive always worked on new years eve and my husband this year is like yknow but we dont even have any plans we were gonna maybe do something with some friends and theyre going to california so im not sure even exactly what im gonna do but um right now theres not an event scheduled 

Recording: (4174/ 8002) 
im 

Recording: (4175/ 8002) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (4176/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4177/ 8002) 
so yknow what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (4178/ 8002) 
i think when you have two or more <laugh> pets you hafta make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (4179/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4180/ 8002) 
yeah it was pretty much upper middle class 

Recording: (4181/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4182/ 8002) 
yeah probably cause we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but theres some for public too 

Recording: (4183/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4184/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (4185/ 8002) 
<laugh> you want some gossip the gossip i heard was that um um the superintendent of schools said that if he was reelected she was going to resign and so they gave her a big raise <laugh> so he she must be a thorn in her side <laugh> 

Recording: (4186/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4187/ 8002) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of a uh how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law yknow it could be something real real technical or something that a three year old could answer because its trying to hit yknow all the areas that youve learned 

Recording: (4188/ 8002) 
but yknow i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (4189/ 8002) 
i dont know somehow or other yeah <laugh> and if they if everybody would just begin to feel that way and when they start to say something nasty would think would i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (4190/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (4191/ 8002) 
i hope not some of these mongers that goes around and always predicts the worst things like everybody saying at the end two thousand happens dont go out and celebrate new years the worlds gonna end well hows it gonna end yknow and 

Recording: (4192/ 8002) 
that was a lot of old thinking 

Recording: (4193/ 8002) 
no offense its easier than trying to call up 

Recording: (4194/ 8002) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (4195/ 8002) 
<laugh> i seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder its like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (4196/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (4197/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4198/ 8002) 
<laugh> well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just wanna shoot somebody unfortunately anybody that says that i i mean im i dont even like stepping on ants but theres those moments where youre like 

Recording: (4199/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4200/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh ah it seems like theres a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (4201/ 8002) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own im thinking i may get into that <laugh> 

Recording: (4202/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (4203/ 8002) 
doesnt even 

Recording: (4204/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (4205/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4206/ 8002) 
um-hum okay 

Recording: (4207/ 8002) 
well i dont know if its monroe county or 

Recording: (4208/ 8002) 
its just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean thats sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously theyre gonna be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i dont know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (4209/ 8002) 
i dont know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (4210/ 8002) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well its my choice oh god my husbands a lot better at these type of questions cause he was methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his its like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser then mine and <laugh> just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and uh being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (4211/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4212/ 8002) 
oh yeah i think everybody should if nothing else you missed your boat by that time 

Recording: (4213/ 8002) 
you cant see it in a day 

Recording: (4214/ 8002) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (4215/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4216/ 8002) 
oh thats good thats good 

Recording: (4217/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4218/ 8002) 
um so i think that part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends you know theyre kind of lost they dont know exactly what theyre doing um where like said ive already done all the stuff that were doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (4219/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4220/ 8002) 
and wouldnt you like them to see that yknow look 

Recording: (4221/ 8002)

i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i dont think it caused any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (4277/ 8002)

Recording: (4330/ 8002) 
yeah hey everybody has it right 

Recording: (4331/ 8002)

i do because they werent yknow they werent in their childrens lives enough you know they werent talking about things being open about things at dinner yknow finding out about school um i you cant blame them for having a site on the internet not too many parents would know that that they their kids yknow um but no i think i i i put the blame on the parents 

Recording: (4337/ 8002) 
right but still my my oldest daughter were for a long time she was in theater and people would say to me how do you feel about that and i said what do you mean how i feel about that yknow she can always wait tables as long as she can support herself self what do i care and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology and now as it turns out shes going to um she just started back shes the one thats having the baby though shes just started back and uh to get certified to teach elementary school because weve talked so much about what where would she do well and she she would just do so well shes really good shes such a kid herself shes really good with with kids maybe second third grade shes so into animals and so into science and understands different kids so that yknow i i think she would be fabulous there and so shes kind of decided but if that if she ends up not doing that i wont care either

Recording: (4339/ 8002) 
i think theyve tried to to uh bring the laymen in to more of the priest the duties of the priest but theres like the consecration uh of the bread and wine that that none of that has been sanctioned they dont perform they dont uh uh um theyre not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism confirmation holy uh well they do holy communion but uh extreme unction matrimony none of those uh have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest but um i still think that its a good uh i do think the involvement of the laymen is very important but i dont have any i i mean that doesnt bother me a bit about women 

Recording: (4340/ 8002) 
yeah um youre you yeah you may be right could be could be 

Recording: (4341/ 8002) 
i like computers i like

um freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a clique you try to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (4353/ 8002) 
yeah thats i mean thats really a tough one uh because its i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer um and yknow i dont think its violence on tv i dont think its working parents i think its and i dont know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily um i i i dont know its a tough one and i mean your daughter uh you said daughters yeah is still young so you have to deal with but is scary you send your kid to school and you hear these things and its just no matter where it is in the country or the world you hear of it yknow really worries you 

Recording: (4354/ 8002) 
<laugh> <laugh> you should be real attentive to whats happening in his school situation his or her 

Recording: (4355/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4356/ 8002) 
so shes and hopefully they will get married soon theyve been together for over a year and a half

yknow why 

Recording: (4358/ 8002) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (4359/ 8002) 
and neither one of these folks could answer it yes or no and theyre going just answer yes or no theyll tell you well i think i stated my point very clearly when i was no the answer is yes or is it was it was um healthcare for living partners um its a simple question yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that yknow and i know that that from a p r stand point you dont wanna you dont wanna shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like the damn it yknow if youre running for office you should just just be up front 

Recording: (4360/ 8002) 
well right now i think he knows enough im just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things im pretty im like wow i cant even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and cars and rockets an <laugh> 

Recording: (4361/ 8002) 
right <laugh> 

Recording: (4362/ 8002) 
just i think its uh a to reflect the the uh um beliefs that were trying to carry and and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean im not saying that its terrible it but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff then it somebody might not believe that they have anything credible to say and a lot of times if youre dressed more respectfully that to yknow i mean most the people will accept you if youre dressed in a dress whereas i mean even a person in a nose ring will will respect you but but then youre in a youre at a disadvantage if you dont <laugh> dress in a certain way 

Recording: (4363/ 8002) 
they they definitely struggle it they do some i i think to be that high up obviously youre gonna come in contact with powerful peoplerich people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i dont know i dont think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the republicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch id probably 

Recording: (4364/ 8002) 
um hum

Recording: (4375/ 8002)

Recording: (4527/ 8002)

um honestly it would be id probably base the decision basically political um i cant say id really hold that against him or anything obviously its not something id be like oh good well lets vote for him sincehe did that 

Recording: (4529/ 8002) 
where as i dont know lutheran is a little bit more open to

oh they have religion they have a religion class they have religion everyday but some of it is just starting with prayer and bible stories and some its more the values uh lot those teachers arent catholic which i was surprised to hear that uh in fact the religion teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade she had religion class everyday wasnt catholic 

Recording: (4531/ 8002) 
and then as the community fanned out then they had bigger houses i like living in the old area better i like the houses in the new area better theres one in particular thats just gorgeous 

Recording: (4532/ 8002) 
and then we wed know where to shift from there to another target 

Recording: (4533/ 8002) 
so hes not so crazy she was doing this thing where um if he did a good job on something she would give him like a fake coin hed put it in his bank and at the end of the week or something he could cash it in and get a video or a video game or something yknow that shows responsibility too but 

Recording: (4534/ 8002)

Recording: (4541/ 8002) 
so she did i dont know whether it was more than a year or not for i think it was forty dollars a month and uh course that was forty dollars more than they had otherwise and uh then i think the lets see she well she went out there when bernice was going to school and bernice went to my oldest sister went to know whether its first or maybe second grade out there says she she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever had in grade school uh then they hired a girl to come in as a hired girl and uh about the second or third day she was there she wasnt wasnt feeling very good 

Recording: (4542/ 8002)

um-hum 

Recording: (4546/ 8002) 
you youre youre intelligent yknow 

Recording: (4547/ 8002) 
um-hum i think his mom was pretty yknow doesnt really talk about it wanna talk about it he comes from his his real biological family is very um i dont know if guess youd call it dysfunctional or theyre um he didnt live with them after he was fourteen or so his it was just so bad that his mom couldnt take care of him and his his siblings so he was pretty much on his own but he was taken in by a family that was members of the mormon church 

Recording: (4548/ 8002) 
they they its just set up uh on a flat bed truck on wall street in new york and do a concert there <laugh> 

Recording: (4549/ 8002) 
compared to you youll have more loyalty i would think and at the same time those people wont be thinking about being hungry while theyre on the line working for you 

Recording: (4550/ 8002) 
um-hum but yknow when he first came here he said that you couldnt win here because he had too many slow white guys so 

Recording: (4551/ 8002) 
when they drove by i guess 

Recording: (4552/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4553/ 8002) 
yeah because uh theyre more you always hear about my black ass my you know what i mean and stuff like this and i could give a shit 

Recording: (4554/ 8002) 
if not you just get the the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but its interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like theres this huge place and youre gonna get that no matter what and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (4555/ 8002) 
um i i i when i was growing up i had i had a whole litter of cats 

Recording: (4556/ 8002) 
yeah and yeah and i wouldnt do that i if i was yknow had no children and 

Recording: (4557/ 8002) 
so yknow um it its pretty pretty busy there but it its spread out over the sixteen hours is where as port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes in an hours time so 

Recording: (4558/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4559/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4560/ 8002) 
its more our society than the guns i believe its more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (4561/ 8002) 
and just ya know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it was always something different i have to be outside and it was just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (4562/ 8002) 
yeah it hasnt it hasnt gone far as loan sharking but yknow the the thing of it is its fun when you win and its still fun when you lose i mean yknow just 

Recording: (4563/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (4564/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4565/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (4566/ 8002) 
no not at all i wouldve rather voted for mccain over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which im not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but im saying like bush is um he just seems like he didnt really like everythings been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that thats a big issue but i dont like the way he addressed it yknow that to me just if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way hes handling it saying im not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over if he didnt do it he might as well just be like no i didnt do it 

Recording: (4567/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (4568/ 8002)

yeah i dont think that though yknow women need to work and most families do need two incomes um and plus when kids go into high school you know you have pardon me you have to worry about them but yknow you you have to let them experience some of life on their own

Recording: (4691/ 8002) 
well that basically is yknow as your influx of people move outer city limits and everything yknow then uh yknow you got to have places for them to shop and everything and basically the northland malls been there forever jacob who owned indians owned it uh and he never did anything to it yknow so you got over at your lazarus or penneys and uh mainstay places that generally move there because of the uh years ago because it was something well it was right there with with a lot of people population and everything and then like i say if you yknow you got basically the people moving out to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff yknow not that theyre moving away from it theyre still getting into it but uh the district perspective on it uh then you if you build it they will come they say yknow so um-hum um-hum and i guess hes still gonna build it so

Recording: (4794/ 8002) 
happened sometime um probably wouldve been my my freshman year in high school um we were just walking down high street and <laugh> i guess we were wrong place at the wrong time and some people were like yelling stuff and we couldnt make out what they were saying

Recording: (4804/ 8002)

Recording: (4805/ 8002) 
definitely i definitely the way i feel the death penaltys wrong but uh i dont know people are always like oh you know if your mother if your mother was killed god forbid but like you would want the death penalty but honestly i dont think i would i really like id feel angry towards that person but killing them doesnt help me with my maybe the families say it helps with closure and everything but i that to me is its displacing my anger in a way that actually i dont think the my victim that i was so close to me would want me to do yknow so 

Recording: (4806/ 8002) 
thats awfully young but again hes got this baby yet they didnt talk about how this baby how you make a baby or everything and i dont know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and its just like okay

Recording: (4810/ 8002) 
and uh then while she was out there she met a a cowboy who was from also from ohio and uh they uh they were married while they were out there i guess but uh she was <laugh> uh my son used to say she was a piece of work she <laugh> she hadnt definite ideas about pretty near everything 

Recording: (4811/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4812/ 8002) 
yeah that was it thats hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again youre just like wow wait what were those people thinking um-hum yeah 

Recording: (4813/ 8002) 
yeah you uh i yknow ive just come to i always you know prefer for my children and myself i mean uh if theres anything disney i usually go and watch it yknow at the movie theater and after a while its like i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me its like thats a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it

Recording: (4817/ 8002) 
uh hum 

Recording: (4818/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4819/ 8002) 
yeah that yeah um-hum i think the mother has more of an instinct for that but as far as the studies go where the people roll over their babies i dont see how you can roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean 

Recording: (4820/ 8002) 
well see thats not proved out by the the approval ratings he still has higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so yknow people still like what he what hes done i think that that um that yknow people dont like all the crap that went with him as the on tv yknow they say that and theyre theyre still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elizabeth dole they wouldnt have been able to attack on the issues so theyd find other things to get get her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people didnt care about it they didnt care about it before the election they didnt care about it during his campaign they didnt care about it during his presidency it was some republican right wing i dont know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate yknow he may have been a cad yknow he may have yknow but she was twentyone its not like it was someone who couldnt make up her own mind what she wanted to do yknow and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i dont wanna know about it on day one when it hit the the news i didnt want to know about it and on the end when he was yknow not impeached i didnt wanna know about it and in between i didnt wanna know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst ive ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse of of where america is on such issues as gun control and womens rights and and things that are important to people yknow they theyve tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of yknow giving a tax cut people dont want a tax cut when its going to affect their social security or affect yknow uh the the the deficit 

Recording: (4821/ 8002) 
yeah that and i think i im a firm believer that uh little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than look in the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this one you go im getting a gut and yknow its like thats so negative to would you tell your mom that yknow 

Recording: (4822/ 8002)

right 

Recording: (4872/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4873/ 8002) 
i dont know there that much detail but most time it comes down to a lack of uh knowing your your children how theyre gonna react to certain things oh what it is uh i dont know details with thing other than the fact that theyre seem like theres lot emptiness going on uh with them and uh and i think thats part of problem we have in our uh in our life ive uh i itd be very difficult um i think uh in our in traveling if you say okay im gonna give up this life here and go to the third world and live or else do less less reverse bussing hey okay upper arlington you live northwest side why you down and live on the east side

um-hum 

Recording: (4892/ 8002)

Recording: (4897/ 8002) 
you go to right right right well i started going to sunday school when i was five or six years old 

Recording: (4898/ 8002) 
i thought that was just something like maybe unique unique to the states 

Recording: (4899/ 8002) 
thats one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was we were shopping for schools systems just as much yknow so and i dont want to buy a house and i dont want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system so because it seems like since weve bought our house the houses are just doubling and tripling in value its yeah oh i dont know ours is increased quite a lot since weve been there but weve been there i guess about ten years um we live rented in grandview 

Recording: (4900/ 8002) 
<laugh> were were finished <laugh> 

Recording: (4901/ 8002) 
um it would a little bit but at thesametime i mean it was obviously a long time ago i mean i dont know how how far in the past you have to go for thingsto be considered a problem of something coming up again um i mean as long as hes not didnt have any history of being like an addicted user or anything like that i mean i i cant say it really bothers me too much 

Recording: (4902/ 8002) 
just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness forgiveness is granted whatever 

Recording: (4903/ 8002) 
oh he said hes going to kick my you know what and everything i said well be outside you know 

Recording: (4904/ 8002)

Recording: (4913/ 8002) 
i 

Recording: (4914/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4915/ 8002) 
its a real different thing i mean you can understand why itd be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when yknow you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i wouldnt have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (4916/ 8002) 
the problem is lack of commitment the lack of commitment and not saying hey theres a niche for you you cant be a male oh yeah you wanna do the operation i cant be feeling yeah you wanna do well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you cant be

so family um familiarity and um just the community i think crime i think its going up and up um traffic is horrendous but the one but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is expanding so much that we need the orange brailles and um i guess the lack of publicity nationally i i we dont have yknow like the national football teams and now with the hockey coming i i think were getting more recognition but when people talk about columbus they then i dont think they know columbus ohio or columbus georgia or columbus where right

Recording: (5121/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5122/ 8002) 
mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society its usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that weve got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh library of congress has it ill just drive out to washington or have them send it here yknow um that i think is a major contribution of the past generation uh 

Recording: (5123/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (5124/ 8002) 
right right well its sort of a problem as well the yknow does i mean uh its seems yknow from what ive read it if you wanted to make a bomb its fairly uncomplicated yknow so thats 

Recording: (5125/ 8002) 
the food service and she knows that theyre really bad and thats really sad but theyre not doing anything about it 

Recording: (5126/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5127/ 8002) 
yeah it does its not like a skilled profession to me i think 

Recording: (5128/ 8002) 
thats right in other words theres so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5129/ 8002) 
well see thats because i dont think americans travel as much as as like the the europeans do i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they got the trains that the eurotrains and the buses and and and and just like the by just by personal car you can go yknow across just go across the border you can then go and visit uh yknow countries like like its so condensed but here its like weve got our oceans and its like we gotta like fly so so i i think thats why like i think the europeans are more are much more cooler in that respect rather than much more cosmopolitan just because it they they they its like its no big deal for for like somebody in europe to speak like seven languages where here its like yknow you get somebody over here who who can actually who actually knows english <laugh> yknow its like so that thats i think thats i think thats what ill find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5130/ 8002) 
and i would definitely keep a eye out and yknow figure out whats going on yknow 

Recording: (5131/ 8002) 
i got one sister

Recording: (5137/ 8002) 
um-hum uh well my oldest one this is really odd because uh the school she goes to its sort of like uh thrift store chic and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said yknow we are not in the poor house youre not buying clothes in the thrift store so she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh yknow because she just looks like a bum i think and yknow when it was time for like a um a a dance or something she would go out and buy a dress yknow at pennys or someplace at the mall yknow and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home id go what did they say yknow about your dress and she goes jalena is that you and i go see you clean up really nice i said yknow you have the best shape youre ever gone have in your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants i said yknow when you get when you get in your fifties and youve got a gut and a big ass yknow you could do that 

Recording: (5138/ 8002) 
but we go out and look uh we look do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the the uh secular world 

Recording: (5139/ 8002) 
im working here uh um but working um work study 

Recording: (5140/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5141/ 8002) 
he is 

Recording: (5142/ 8002) 
and uh thats when i lost my job after that and things got difficult more and more difficult um was unable to work full time im doing some part time work right now working with people with mental illness um but its yknow the the thing im running into out there is that uh nobody wants to pay you to do anything <laugh> uh i dont understand that but uh and then the when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you yknow they give you a pager a cell phone and they want to know where you are morning noon and night seven days a week and thats none of their business um so i the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and and how i operate and will give me freedom to do what i can do i have a bachelor of arts in communications but its been more of a problem than its been a asset um interviewing for jobs people that uh were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and uh theyre not gonna hire me when after a year id be their boss <laugh> um so a lot of that is out there uh regardless of what people say im not trying to be pessimistic or negative its just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i havent been ever uh told that my degree matters by any employer uh contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree uh yknow uh people told me soon as i got out of college then i needed a masters and then they said and after you get your masters youll definitely need your doctorate well yknow the people saying this are college people the college is a business uh and it takes awhile to realize that if you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships thats thats good but then even now being a person with a somewhat disability from a brain injury um i mean i dont even like to call it disability and i have uh different abilities now yknow same abilities i used to do but i have to do them a different way um just because my brain functions on a different level and i cant explain that to anybody and i shouldnt have to but im always forced to um but uh trying to find a job yknow uh resulting from this has been difficult and uh and thats uh yknow im not giving up hope or nothing like that im just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh yknow theres just ah um um its very limited out there yknow and your education is is an asset but like i said even as a person uh now going through b v r um im discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelors in other words uh bureau of vocational rehabilitation which is government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and um because i already have a bachelors they wont pay for school now if i were stupid yknow if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and didnt even have my g e d boy theyd pay for my high school my college and everything yknow even living expenses yknow but because i have a bachelors nothing yknow

Recording: (5199/ 8002) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that theres someone thats completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (5200/ 8002) 
because its more open um and you couch it in terms of civil rights um my boyfriends thinks its wrong morally but doesnt think we ought to be discriminating against uh he he thinks its a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through yknow talking to them religion wise um i dont think its a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based and that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different um whatever those eye pieces are contacts i dont wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but thats just cosmetic and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation thats cosmetic too uh and again my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine um so i dont know that anyone could change it what was your question again

Recording: (5213/ 8002) 
uh like i know one of the poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when its meant to kill a rat obviously seems pretty dangerous 

Recording: (5214/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (5215/ 8002) 
there didnt used to be and especially in restaurants and everything and now its such an open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um bodys taste yknow i mean before no id have to go in to a restaurant and salad and baked potato yknow i mean there was nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the foods so cooked down i mean honestly yknow its like no nutritional value 

Recording: (5216/ 8002) 
once youre in it youre been in it and thats it i have thirty two points

Recording: (5223/ 8002) 
<laugh> yeah really i dont know i mean i guess for me i i just i just think jason and i get along so well yknow and and weve been together for about two years and i mean i i dont know i just i do i just i just really like him i dont know if ill feel that way in in ten years from now but it certainly theres a lot of things that that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about different things and and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and um his name was jason too but he he drank a lot 

Recording: (5224/ 8002) 
um i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean theres no more sinister group than the other that i know 

Recording: (5225/ 8002) 
yeah think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area um i dont i dont know i think the main thing that affects me now and since ive been home ive been reading the paper a lot more and yknow im more aware of whats going on and i really um gonna be some kind of activist for <laugh> um i dont know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentlemans clubs and things like that i just i think thats gonna be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um theres one off of uh bethel or no its off of henderson cahoots and then theres the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i couldnt even believe theyre like right across the street from each other yknow and its funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so thinking it really affects it yeah try to go around <laugh> yeah and until they make a womens uh club so wont be real equal <laugh> yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (5226/ 8002) 
um hum yeah 

Recording: (5227/ 8002) 
a lot of people switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (5228/ 8002)

Recording: (5231/ 8002) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the libraries connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got p cs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed uh and now weve gone more out in the public work in the public scene do its not just for the people in the back room uh and then the web yknow people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now were trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just can wants to connect to us

Recording: (5235/ 8002) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school <laugh> starting asking questions about religion and youre saying well i suppose i could answer all of these but <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (5236/ 8002)

Recording: (5306/ 8002) 
if you just look at the nature of what theyre doing its just 

Recording: (5307/ 8002) 
and i think that sometimes they dont even count all the votes or something and sometimes that they want it to go through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority doesnt want that to happen that somehow or other theyll count it so it did or theyll well yknow 

Recording: (5308/ 8002)

Recording: (5359/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5360/ 8002)

Recording: (5364/ 8002) 
and they stopped doing that now

Recording: (5467/ 8002) 
like cathol=catholicism oh from mormons well our basic um real fundamental belief is that the church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve apostles and and but the after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those apostles and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because its still lasted all the same catholic and all the orthodox churches still carry all these beliefs

Recording: (5480/ 8002) 
yeah when i first went to oberlin i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish id maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because im thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and although im certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science um it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5481/ 8002) 
gay people or straight people so

Recording: (5495/ 8002) 
and uh well she the uh the people that own it are starting to build it up now but its been like that it was the first apartment community um in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (5496/ 8002) 
yeah and im closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about <laugh=things> my oldest sister yknow i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i dont stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5497/ 8002)

Recording: (5504/ 8002) 
but managed get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and chris chriss interpretation of the story at this point is one moment im cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment i i turn around theres a large police officer ih=in doorway of your room he said hi <laugh> he said i think you should come downstairs they dont tell chris anything so chris comes downstairs and he stands beside me 

Recording: (5505/ 8002) 
yknow technically theres insanity and there isnt insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who isnt insane and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and um <laugh> um so i got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh reincarnation and the law of cause and effect and if a person murders somebody they need theyll they will pay for that later theres no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their um their guilt and what theyve done and and a lot of them dont they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (5506/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5507/ 8002) 
makes and just keep an eye on whats going on 

Recording: (5508/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (5510/ 8002) 
dont say oh well your sons gonna be gay hes two right now lets you know change this so it so it doesnt come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (5511/ 8002) 
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it 

Recording: (5512/ 8002) 
to get them thinking about it then theyll start to notice it in their life and once they start noticing it theyll start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (5513/ 8002) 
yeah we yup you have to concentrate on whats important or it just flies by and you dont even see it yeah 

Recording: (5514/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5515/ 8002)

um-hum 

Recording: (5522/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (5523/ 8002) 
well uh yeah i think its real important to really good uh get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they dont um then its not ever going to work because because theres always gonna be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think its real important and theres no age limit on that to when you really feel <noisegood> about yourself and you really know what you want to do then thats the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people their yknow theres so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get yknow off course and everything else and and then it doesnt stay the same i mean its all exciting and and all that and then it yknow i think its kind of <laugh> 

Recording: (5524/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5525/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5526/ 8002)

Recording: (5528/ 8002) 
yeah yeah my best friend lives in on outside canberra and she has a lot of medical problems but huh 

Recording: (5529/ 8002)

the rail service no 

Recording: (5531/ 8002) 
with that boy 

Recording: (5532/ 8002) 
then you have a choice there you would not necessarily uh have you shouldve had more self control and not had the child dont expect me to pay for your uh lack of uh will power thats that is a selfish attitude thats stealing as well 

Recording: (5533/ 8002) 
i have to admit when we go to try play golf sometimes and not have a tee time you cant even get in 

Recording: (5534/ 8002)

i was about to say now on the record or off the 

Recording: (5537/ 8002) 
yknow they shouldnt know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that a yknow how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (5538/ 8002) 
right same way with kids if you have a penalty for them theyll learn their lesson but its also the parent that has to set the example and theres too many older folks right now i dont think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home theyre aggravated theyre upset somebody else have had their kids all day and its its its terrible that the situations got that way but i do feel that the older people including our government people and everybody thats at the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (5539/ 8002) 
fruit loops yeah and its like what is the difference yknow besides the price 

Recording: (5540/ 8002) 
oxleys is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5541/ 8002)

Recording: (5542/ 8002) 
which was scheduled in the evenings i when was working and i couldnt even go to therapy 

Recording: (5543/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5544/ 8002) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something i think thats had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (5545/ 8002) 
because yknow the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and yknow at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff its not game game its it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (5546/ 8002) 
it it wasnt easy and at first it was probably a lot harder then after youve been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to coming back here was 

Recording: (5547/ 8002) 
oh uh-huh 

Recording: (5548/ 8002) 
now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to i think that the you said get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth i thats thats the family but uh i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values uh but but but good values i whether theyre old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but the i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and that will help them permeate the entire society and but its got to start back here in the first and i think 

Recording: (5549/ 8002) 
i think that uh yeah it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5550/ 8002) 
at our desks we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (5551/ 8002) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5552/ 8002) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again thats just like the people when i worked in bars theyd always want to hold the bartender responsible but say you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5553/ 8002) 
sure <laugh> 

Recording: (5554/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5555/ 8002) 
and sooner or later yknow all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there its such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (5556/ 8002) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then wed better not yknow 

Recording: (5557/ 8002) 
it doesnt matter how much money theyre given for their education theyve 

Recording: (5558/ 8002) 
well number one its a little bit smaller more controlled area <laugh> quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to the sister yknow my sister lives up there she moved there from uh down in west virginia so yknow with mom having all the peace and <laugh> peace and quiet she yknow plus in a place thats only year old

uh were planning on moving in the spring 

Recording: (5560/ 8002) 
she thats a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much yknow 

Recording: (5561/ 8002) 
they go shes got it and they go on to the next guy and then all a sudden youre going off this way and they go uh six nine juliet uh where are you going and youre like uh i uh told me to and then they go oh brother yknow so now yknow the attention is diverted to you so thats usually what the problem is because most pilots are there are really professional yeah um-hum 

Recording: (5562/ 8002) 
according to that and so uh i cant think what some of their observations were but theres usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5563/ 8002) 
ive given you plenty of opinions havent i ive just loaded them on you okay i i just have a question is do you is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5564/ 8002) 
my boyfriend would love to mess with this i just want you to know that hed be like taking it apart putting it back together 

Recording: (5565/ 8002)

Recording: (5573/ 8002)

Recording: (5576/ 8002) 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh but i i went to school with blacks so i mean that wasnt that big a thing except for the influx of the you know i didnt realize how many were being drafted or being enlisting into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (5577/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (5578/ 8002) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (5579/ 8002) 
um well actually its sort of all happening in a certain area yknow with yknow very high unemployment like council council states um yknow the sort of stereotype yknow kind of bad family environment yknow parents have lots of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and yknow a lot of these girls that have been interviewed yknow say oh yknow i wanted something to love or yknow we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and yknow a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying oh yknow he had yknow slept with like ten girls or something and im thinking oh my gosh yknow and hes thirteen and yknow had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they yknow they get unemployment because once theyve had a kid even if theyre not of working age they get like a an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby theyre provided theyre the top of the list for a council house so they get their own there was actually a long documentary on before i left um yknow of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents and yknow her parents were at the end of their rope she got pregnant and she was like well yknow hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she doesnt have to pay any utilities or anything and yknow what more could she want yknow was basically what she was saying ive got my own place i can do whatever i want im getting money and i dont have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because theyre almost rewarded for yknow 

Recording: (5580/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5581/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5582/ 8002)

Recording: (5584/ 8002) 
so they built one out in hilliard 

Recording: (5585/ 8002)

Recording: (5586/ 8002) 
yeah well peoples people dont have the priorities they should yknow what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do <laugh> yknow did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything yknow i not to me if you dont have time then yknow youre just floating along trying to <laugh> taking up space no <laugh> 

Recording: (5587/ 8002) 
i think this past year they had two murders over there and it was publicized in the columbus area but uh it should 

Recording: (5588/ 8002) 
yeah there is theres like two people who are like from the uh i mean theyre not old but theyre like from the forties and they have bought generators theyve bought water theyve got extra food theyve got a extra freezers they bought ammunition its like hello yknow i just think its

Recording: (5590/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5591/ 8002)

Recording: (5593/ 8002) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (5594/ 8002) 
and i mean yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know thats good but at the same time it the cause of it doesnt really matter i mean the fact of matter is its there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (5595/ 8002) 
thing at first but she my she loves my kids and she loves my husband 

Recording: (5596/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5597/ 8002) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were gonna buy house in clintonville to hold them and rent them my problem is i dont have any money so i that down payment has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road its for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when shes getting ready to move out shes like twenty four and they couldnt find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well well find something and ill buy and ill be your land lady and then whatll itll be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bottom line is i i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i didnt have a down payment i had nothing so so its like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would you would be fine you be renting it you wouldnt buy anything that you didnt think you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (5598/ 8002)

yeah i i yknow i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter almost every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i wasnt a child but its like you dont have realistic expectations of what what children are capable of or what they can do because if theyre really verbal and my kids always have been really verbal because ive talked to them from the moment they were born even yknow when they couldnt talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole obviously see i dont shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well yknow you make sure you give it food and water and when it died it i was so surprised that she hadnt given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you dont yeah they dont get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone yknow and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because but i mean now that was bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things or i would i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly

Recording: (5737/ 8002)

no not at all i think in the united states its the driving force of our of our of our government and and even like cause without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations the you couldnt have nearly the things that weve had and i think to a degree theyve become fairly powerful but i dont think thats necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that supported supported the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you dont necessarily need a union 

Recording: (5748/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (5749/ 8002) 
i sort of wore out um that and um just oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting exhausted and uh it was just so demanding and we didnt know as a community how to let uh up so i had to <laugh> had to i had to withdraw another thing was im very into um metaphysics and studying and meditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was in there um thats one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so theres always people coming for four or five days and you have to explain everything in life to them in four or five days and plus we uh lived in um a a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant and a hardware and had a mail route and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we uh made our own bread and we uh milked a cow and uh <laugh> so its just plain hard physical work plus all the mental um stuff of dealing with peoples really big questions it it was intense <laugh> yknow so thats the reason i had to quit is was like if i could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself i would have been okay but that wasnt how it worked so had to to pull back from it <laugh>

Recording: (5793/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5794/ 8002) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh id say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know thats not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now thats not necessarily his opinion so im trying to make a point there <laugh> but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had uh uh various people within his community or whether whether youre talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then slowly then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of today and ill leave out this the last two years it because its because its rather specific right now but uh going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but im seeing it even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there uh hey come on well go to dinner well go do this and well do this and do this just uh just barely barely breaking uh the barrier but not breaking the law uh so yes very definitely progressively has changed 

Recording: (5795/ 8002) 
no the funniest thing though was with my husband and the child because hes so hes so fair and he said in the hospital people were looking at him like theres no way that could happen <laugh> he said that because yknow they take them off to weigh weigh him or whatever and i said you dont leave him he said people were looking at him like 

Recording: (5796/ 8002) 
and they never were i mean the same with like in france especially oh mcdonalds well mcdonalds was full of all the french people yknow i mean 

Recording: (5797/ 8002) 
well unfortunately i dont think its fair but i think in the long run it doesnt have to be a college education because most of those people probably wouldnt want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something itll give them a little bit of hope if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice its its its up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah its its not fair but uh for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they didnt get an education i mean now thats a broad spectrum and i know its not all that cut and dried um yeah it would upset me but hopefully id step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (5798/ 8002) 
i dont know about that yeah he hasnt shown that period yet i dont know if hes supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes to his aunt amys yknow its bye mom yknow <laugh> look up okay bye <laugh> thats it

Recording: (5943/ 8002) 
im 

Recording: (5944/ 8002) 
yknow they want to be judged as like everybody else but yknow i think um they have so many different ideas and not that either one of thems right but still um i i think theres always going to barrier there theyre just kids are just not all kids are going to get along yknow i mean 

Recording: (5945/ 8002)

Recording: (5947/ 8002) 
oh okay okay its part of growing up and i ive been there done that too but still you have to you have to um know theres respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they saw the interaction with the elderly people the school he went to a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers ive gone to sporting events and their teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids i ask them i said do you guys ever go home said no oh yeah i said but theyre always there theyre not there just teaching a class theyre not there preparing the class theyre there after the class theyre there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock oh time to quit theyre gone those people dont know meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves little more with somebody thats having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i didnt say willing to work not knowing theyre going to be compensated because theyll be compensated not necessarily materialistically theyll be then more than theyre expected theyll be recompensated somewhere but the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing well gee whats for whats in it for me whats in it for you is uh intangible are you willing 

Recording: (5948/ 8002) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brother in law is gay and when i met him i knew he was i yknow he was the type some of them you cant tell well it doesnt matter what they look like um but my husband said all through growing up he liked men he didnt like girls he looked at magazine you know all this stuff and i thought thats so funny because growing up i just didnt know know anybody that was um but you know he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning and she was from germany which made it a little tough because yknow they didnt talk about those things over there at all for a long time but um then she became very open with him and every but everybody knew and that was in the eighties and yknow if some kids know it when theyre young and growing up yknow i dont know if its best to not say it or to yknow be open but if theyre open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then than if they wait later on in their life yknow but some of sometimes i guess they change yknow most the men i knew right off the bat know i mean i mean it was it and it was all through their life it wasnt as though they just said oh im im going be gay 

Recording: (5949/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5950/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5951/ 8002) 
and so its the thing is though its almost like im really glad that willing to say i just cant make those uh hed let hed let my daughter whos he left left her at the movies one night they went to the movies there was no um the movie they went to see was sold out the next one wasnt gonna start until nine thirty which means this kids twelve years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve yknow at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although this tomboy whos just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there and uh they said they called me but i i was running the sweeper so i didnt hear the phone so left her there and he said that she was gonna call back yknow at at a certain time and i was gonna tell her what she could or couldnt do so i said yknow well youre gonna have to come home yknow hes gonna have to come and get you oh come on no were not gonna do that i you know you cant be this late so he went back down picked them and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (5952/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5953/ 8002) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be i normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (5954/ 8002) 
very different <laugh> uh just been a lot of innovations and 

Recording: (5955/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5956/ 8002) 
so i dont know just lucky <laugh> 

Recording: (5957/ 8002) 
um-hum and then they end up okay anyway <laugh> thats good <laugh> 

Recording: (5958/ 8002) 
oh you have to nowadays yknow i dont understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just doesnt happen now now yknow if your wife didnt work you could expect these things but shes doing forty hours a week too so it is its work and its a full time job they start shoot the seven year old just brought here it is the end of the year second grade she brings home this project gonna have to have a book report use three books of reference yknow shes never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long yknow getting this information out of her yknow she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on it she gonna have to stand up in front of the class and make a box with a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems more like yknow sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids yknow i cant believe in second grade we were already writing cursive already thats all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of it yeah shes in fractions shes doing fractions shes doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one two <laugh> you know in second grade it just seems like theyre three years ahead so 

Recording: (5959/ 8002) 
he found out he could just move yeah so yknow he always got away from that 

Recording: (5960/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5961/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (5962/ 8002) 
yeah <laugh> yeah <laugh> um-hum 

Recording: (5963/ 8002) 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that thats had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think thats why theyre having more shootings in schools and uh i uh the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them theres too much profanity theres too much sex theres too much just do what i want i gotta do my own thing thats where the when i want to do my own thing started he says with the womens feminist movement <laugh> and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because after all so much speaking up and they want to do things my bing crosby who was it no um 

Recording: (5964/ 8002) 
you know you know what i mean 

Recording: (5965/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5966/ 8002) 
cause theyre so stylish 

Recording: (5967/ 8002) 
yeah exactly and its just its just ridiculous but so many people dont seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now arent necessarily followed and yknow that kind of thing 

Recording: (5968/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5969/ 8002) 
i said yep i said you caught mommy saying a bad word and youd have got soap in your mouth yep so i go in the bathroom now what i always always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and i just put a little bit of soap on the end of their tongue well now ive been ive had false teeth since i was about thirty two needless to say i had false teeth when this kid did this <laugh> and she was only about five years old word word go in the bathroom i sit down on that toilet stool and i sit there i stick out my tongue she takes that cake of soap she doesnt rub my tongue she twists it it got on my teeth and it took me almost two weeks to get that soap taste off my teeth no matter how i scrubbed needless to say if id begin to get impatient after that and im ready to say something im look around to see if theres 

Recording: (5970/ 8002) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like theysaid they came out and said thecatholic church was against it but at the same time like with the research things like that where theyre saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they couldnt cantso much really condemn it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (5971/ 8002) 
hum um hum um

Recording: (5976/ 8002) 
just yknow 

Recording: (5977/ 8002) 
but its because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so its just that kind of thing 

Recording: (5978/ 8002) 
yknow how far are they held responsible i dont know youd have to go on a case by case basis 

Recording: (5979/ 8002)

i dont have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like yeah you should get out before you actually fail the class <laugh> and um it was it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think thats what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just um thats uh unwise in in whether or not it was worth while and i believe that its uh horribly worth while now and yet now im not taking classes so 

Recording: (6009/ 8002) 
right um-hum 

Recording: (6010/ 8002) 
um-hum its kind of frustrating but im i its a its probably good for me because im so its hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to believe yknow i just want to convince them but i cant do that so its a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (6011/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (6012/ 8002) 
yeah that blocks out all that uh extraneous stuff thats trying to pull you away 

Recording: (6013/ 8002) 
at each others throat for this that and the other and and yknow devon is uh my daughters the one that really got put in the middle of it yknow and probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably couldve been more uh problems legal problems yknow as far as uh going back and forth to court and putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff yknow and so uh in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (6014/ 8002) 
that you really didnt need because then you could get more bang for your bucks 

Recording: (6015/ 8002) 
thats good no not really actually some i have and then ive run into the people that just like anything they wanna get out of their hometown they dont like it they complain but normally i find that those people arent taking advantage of the yknow free art shows and yknow i mean the things that are free im like oh have you done this no i didnt even know about it and youve lived here all your life and ive only lived here x number of years and 

Recording: (6016/ 8002)

Recording: (6040/ 8002) 
oh i see 

Recording: (6041/ 8002) 
and it was through joseph smith and he translated the book of mormon with help from god and so thats basically it i mean the book of mormon is a counterpart to the bible its a its from prophets that lived in america 

Recording: (6042/ 8002) 
um yknow i mean i dont think they should make people pray if they dont want to before class or anything yknow like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and whats out there and yknow most kids know what the wrong thing is but

Recording: (6047/ 8002) 
yeah im at the end of it all 

Recording: (6048/ 8002) 
right and well and theres nothing wrong with that 

Recording: (6049/ 8002)

Recording: (6100/ 8002) 
oh well thats unfortunate <laugh> 

Recording: (6101/ 8002) 
i think um the people who have already graduated theyre like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults its just that the kids want to go it its just thought of as a somewhat party school 

Recording: (6102/ 8002) 
yeah and and everybodys gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with so yknow and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was a center for the football team as he grew up older yknow uh he realized that he wasnt as big as important as he uh and he blew out his knee for a o u yknow i went to i went to school with larry hunter whos the a basketball coach for uh o u now and uh and he had the same thing happen to him uh he had uh scholarship for o u and both of his knees are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ballplayer probably one best ones i ever seen and uh rivalled like a larry byrd yknow back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a nice guy yknow never let it get to him

Recording: (6104/ 8002) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh theyre little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because theyre gonna have to go to college and this is like the only life theyre gonna get yknow they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everythings just a big joke yknow im gonna play in a rock band yknow they all think theyre gonna be rock stars and drummers and and yknow they could care less about anything it hasnt hit them yet this is my real life duh this is my one real life better not throw it away they waste time yknow they lose stuff

i think theres a heck of a lot more to it then what well probably ever know um you know they really havent checked into the background of the parents you know theyre still what their beliefs were and everything uh and i think thats a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidentally where uh some kid shoots another kid you know and then the parents are are responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed uh then they killed themselves so well never know from their endpoint why they did it but i think theres got to be something that we could find out from you know uh from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him making him do it you know 

Recording: (6118/ 8002)

Recording: (6147/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6148/ 8002) 
it was just like that im telling you it was and we would see yknow they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch i i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (6149/ 8002) 
well i dont really like the uh i dont i really dont like that job but uh yknow i like the people there but its like uh way too busy i think 

Recording: (6150/ 8002) 
no i think were only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them ive known um from middle school and following them up and yknow they just all go their different ways like the one girl i was friends with at world park i mean she was a grade lower than me but when that we seen each other in the halls like hey whats up and and wed talk and yknow whats going on and were doing this after school and that in high school i didnt know anything i i know she was bad <laugh> and that was it <laugh> 

Recording: (6151/ 8002) 
it was we had a little gallery um we were in clintonville for a a year or so and then we moved to grandview and it was just fine art we called it fine art crafts and it was handmaid stuff from local people and we had lot of jewelry and pottery and silk and paintings that kind stuff 

Recording: (6152/ 8002) 
yknow he says that e equals m c squared i say its e equals m c cubed because the the world is three dimensional its not two dimensional uh two dimensional limits everything but you look at his theory of relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (6153/ 8002) 
yeah i do too 

Recording: (6154/ 8002) 
exactly but i do there and theres the other side um they uh with with native americans too its yknow yknow our children are being taken away from us well not exactly youre giving up your children and and then something has to be done but but theres also theres also that uh i i mean i think that it is probably a legitimate fear that children children of that group are gonna yknow gonna be homogenized out of out of their heritage but i dont know uh yknow theyre kids without parents <laugh> 

Recording: (6155/ 8002) 
because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict for a while 

Recording: (6156/ 8002)

Recording: (6160/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6161/ 8002) 
so went to and high school 

Recording: (6162/ 8002) 
oh i dont really think so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i dont i guess i dont i dont get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i dont yell and scream at them i mean realize they didnt ask to have a learning disability i mean they and that they cant theyre not some teachers think theyre just being belligerent and that if they wanted to straighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they cant change their learning disability anymore than you can change your brown eyes yknow they were born with it its genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just dont learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way its like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well thats how they are yknow maybe they dont learn well by listening maybe they dont learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when theyre up moving around doing something yknow you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say you say turn to page three ninety three or and they turn to three thirty nine in their book yknow and they think they did what you said its just like somethings mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes youd probably have a lot of empathy for them 

Recording: (6163/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6164/ 8002)

Recording: (6293/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6294/ 8002) 
thats what we figure in a few years hell be fine its just getting there its been very difficult i mean theres times when we didnt know where he was for a week at a week at a time he i was driving lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street and thats its its hit pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (6295/ 8002)

thats true 

Recording: (6308/ 8002) 
but uh you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents id be concerned about that but thats not gonna happen in this case i dont think and the because of her age and this makes no sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it doesnt make any sense to me but so the yknow theyre talking to a social worker now to find out they dont want take the baby home because theyre afraid of being too attached to it then and they dont think its a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly her mothers alcoholic um they

i think the one of the things that we when when youre baptized is that youre really supposed to help other people to like if if somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else but its easy a lot of times just to fall into the yknow like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos yknow they dont wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear makeup if we want <laugh> but so i think a lot of times people do fall in to sort of but i i was not raised mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because its so new to me that i am just yknow i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and im also not afraid of people who arent mormons because i think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that dont believe like youve been taught i think a lot of the yknow we dont drink alcohol we dont theres a lot of restrictions i guess you call them restrictions but theyre i feel like theyre more just health codes just keep you healthy and so um it might be its like if we if america yknow were were used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might wanna get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about yknow kind of thing but i im not i dont have any of those barriers

Recording: (6620/ 8002)

and if its not a necessity ill have to forfeit it right now while a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras and in order to do that both have to work well consequently whos really raising the kids if theyre lucky theyve got a loving grandparent ninety nine times out of a hundred i dont know if thats a good statistic its the babysitters or yknow these places its not a babysitter its a babysitter school or something like that and thats not the same loving cuddling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids and i think that thats of things they can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because thats a terrible influence a lot of kids its taken over their life if it is not that now its worse yet its the kids are on the internet now thats even worse because now you cant even hear what theyre getting into at least on tv you walk in see it and turn it off now you can go in i guess and see what theyre on the internet sorry you cant have the internet anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if theyve got the right program and the right person theyre talking to but too many times its the other way around 

Recording: (6637/ 8002) 
or or somebody or or or later theyll claim that i was coerced to saying that as i walked out the door yknow and its a big lie 

Recording: (6638/ 8002)

Recording: (6642/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6643/ 8002) 
well generally they have some area i dont think ive ever met the kid yet the special kid who has no area that he doesnt excel in like once i had a sixth grade girl who still didnt know her time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back ive had kids who they got every badge you can get in boy scouts and yknow i mean theres usually something that theyre really it might not be related to school but theres usually something that theyre really really good at in some other area like theres swimming or or scouting or whatever so they yknow but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than the normal person with a hundred or ninety five i q now ive seen them long enough to know that and worked with them long enough to know that well like i have one boy who cant spell them he still spells it t h i m and he took my computer apart the other day and adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works 

Recording: (6644/ 8002) 
thats good to be there 

Recording: (6645/ 8002) 
uh yeah um yes and no theyre kind of weird like that um one set of grandparents really i cant hear ever says anything theres a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racist um but at the same time it i dont know they almost set up like a double standard for black people there are black people that they really like and i mean theyre actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they dont like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that theyre racist towards i mean its the same thing that goes with white people obviously there are white you can stand theyre white people that are just obnoxious and you dont wanna deal with um i mean its basically the same thing right yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly um i really dont think we do for the most part i cant say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably wouldve caused a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i dont really see too many sexist problems i definitely do see guys still be more like the decision making type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure thats being a woman as causing problems to em 

Recording: (6646/ 8002) 
and they dont know any different 

Recording: (6647/ 8002) 
oh did you come in 

Recording: (6648/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6649/ 8002) 
uh his mother died um the week after we got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age eleven and just over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and didnt make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though im a nurse <laugh> is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (6650/ 8002) 
i mean therell be there seems to me there more one liners so im a little disappointed im sad that the shows going off the the shows gonna stop but im not as sad because the product im getting now it with the simpsons having it being replaced by futurama which ah i find to be absolute genius so its not so bad it xfiles im sad but not as sad based on the past couple seasons when deep space nine went off the the air that one really bothered me and they even had a star trek replacement 

Recording: (6651/ 8002) 
yknow i certainly wouldnt and would i expect my mom to stay with with that in that kind of a situation no way i would want her to be happy and i would want my dad to be happy also so ultimately for that situation i think it was much better um they got married kind of young too yknow and i think that i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more careful i know that that now its a lot different than it used to be people would get married and uh theyd just be expected to stay together and theres a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and theyre miserable 

Recording: (6652/ 8002) 
a lot a lot of people 

Recording: (6653/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6654/ 8002)

Recording: (6655/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6656/ 8002) 
yeah i think thats yknow im im not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the people fall through 

Recording: (6657/ 8002) 
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems its so hard to get anything done solve them unless you unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know thats the big thing now but just that ya know its just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they dont see the support throughout through the administration and if they do have they have to wait til somethings pretty pretty egregious before they before its dealt with 

Recording: (6658/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6659/ 8002)

Recording: (6662/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6663/ 8002)

Recording: (6709/ 8002) 
well im very much in favor of gun control very strong gun control um i it they just seem to be too available uh but then some of the things that the schools are doing about it know the kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets suspended thats a little much but 

Recording: (6710/ 8002) 
i was more comfortable here than in high school you dont see like the big cliques like the popular abercrombie wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together its a big mix of people and everyones doing their own thing 

Recording: (6711/ 8002) 
really why just because its close to japan 

Recording: (6712/ 8002) 
so hard i mean every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an f and when uh my yeah oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there and once she got into it she went uh maybe not <laugh> so i said well what yknow whatever so then she wanted to go to because its basically a columbus public school thats geared to college only i mean if if youre not going to college dont go there because you will flunk out its very hard and she got in the second year three weeks before school started and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of material thats got to be done in three weeks so i thought well ill just call and i called and i talked to the principal and i said yknow they gave us all this stuff and yknow everybody else has had june july august to get this done and shes got three weeks and she goes and the principal goes thats correct and i go well theres no way she can get this done and i said yknow everybody else has had all this time and shes gonna get it done in three weeks and they go thats right so they take theres no excuses yknow and its it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because yknow basically they say uh were talking about china this week and uh on december the fifteenth we want a report on why chinese people do what they do yknow and its like and every week they dont come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the outline right and its up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i have to bibliography i have to have the facts i have to interview some people and if you dont sit down with a little calendar and go this week im getting this done this week im getting this done and this you just fail so my oldest daughter is pretty uh detail oriented so after we kind of helped her start yknow and say yknow youre youre gonna hafta do these things so you get this done and i said and basically get it done like two weeks before its done so then you can say oh this isnt very good and yknow amend it or whatever or or help somebody yknow get somebody with typing whatever so shes really good and its its helped her at school a lot because i know they uh she she toured here at ohio state and there were some people here that come from cahs and they go this will be easier than your highschool <laugh> so 

Recording: (6713/ 8002) 
yeah we um we have two computers in our house and they both have internet on them and um its called all advantage and theyll pay you to go to websites and its like twenty five cent an hour or something i dont remember what it was but we havent got a check yet but <laugh> 

Recording: (6714/ 8002) 
no sunlight you know the and they dont give him they keep it warm and hes not allowed sheets or razors or you know other than electric razors so he cant kill himself so youre just stuck theres nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just the agony and the and the i think youd have to go insane like theres only so much you can id ask for board games or something but like he doesnt even hear a human voice because i think its something like that was written in the scriptures like youre dead to the world for uh is the worse that you can do and so the world sees him you know what i mean so thatd be rough thatd be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i would like they say like now like people that observe him hes like sings to himself and he reads the bible like everyday and but like i dont know thatd be strange be such a horrible thing to go through i couldnt imagine being locked in a room for like few days 

Recording: (6715/ 8002) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest differences just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (6716/ 8002)

Recording: (6770/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6771/ 8002) 
yeah um and this is something ive thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where its very conservative yknow not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course itd be really competitive i i probably wouldnt be working as a freelancer today i came to columbus there wasnt yknow there wasnt much going on when i came here 

Recording: (6772/ 8002) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora yknow a hat he looked so cool yknow because joe paterno he always wears a tie i dont know he just he hes a great coach 

Recording: (6773/ 8002) 
but yknow what i mean when he was about nine years old but hes known me all my life so yknow what i mean it wasnt no big shock 

Recording: (6774/ 8002) 
no uh was just the usual thing since she touched my things <laugh> ya know because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and so ya know so that and interests so it there wasnt much of that but there was the usual ya know shes breathing on me in the car hes humming too loud <laugh> i dont know if youve got brothers and sisters but yeah youve probably been youve went through it all yeah well there were five of us and <laugh> a lot of that 

Recording: (6775/ 8002)

Recording: (6776/ 8002) 
but then youll have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (6777/ 8002) 
oh really 

Recording: (6778/ 8002) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (6779/ 8002) 
yknow they never ask for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and i think it just set people back now were trying real hard to catch up and at some point were going to um yknow have to put a levy on again and and uh who knows whats happen were keeping rosa smith right now because shes so good p r with the with the business community but the business community in columbus doesnt really support the schools they dont i mean weve got two new uh stadiums and we havent got any increase in school funding 

Recording: (6780/ 8002) 
yep uh my oldest shes the oldest um shes got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees him um and then they got two other girls and they live together got a house yknow theyre on theyre going through marriage theyve been together for like five years and theyre not going theyre not doing very well right now but hopefully yknow theyll get over that and then i got an older brother who um him and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby 

Recording: (6781/ 8002) 
oh wow 

Recording: (6782/ 8002) 
so they i have o s u insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they wouldnt admit me they told me they were going to make wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital i crawled out of the car crawled into the hospital and told them either admit me or id crawl out the door 

Recording: (6783/ 8002) 
so uh he finally decided uh yknow after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway yknow 

Recording: (6784/ 8002) 
so once you convince people that theres nothing be scared of here and theres nothing to be scared of there i mean and then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (6785/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6786/ 8002)

Recording: (6799/ 8002) 
i get wick that is it <laugh> 

Recording: (6800/ 8002) 
and thats what im saying atoning for sins its quite a hypocrisy when you got a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i asked the priest cold hard question 

Recording: (6801/ 8002) 
yknow what happened like in the same year eighty eight yknow so but it was it was pretty tough but i just didnt deal with it properly yknow i shouldve went and got counseling and by the way i probably shouldve got marriage counseling but i refused to do that too so but i didnt think i had a problem i thought she was the one with one 

Recording: (6802/ 8002) 
simply because its not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (6803/ 8002) 
the university never has money thats like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two or two jobs for ten years when i was here the first ten years just to make a living

um-hum 

Recording: (6807/ 8002) 
<laugh> yeah i dont know where theyre going now but 

Recording: (6808/ 8002) 
i think theyre retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i dont know well 

Recording: (6809/ 8002) 
i think so 

Recording: (6810/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6811/ 8002)

Recording: (6813/ 8002) 
yknow for me getting out of bed is is a victory yknow for the longest time i was so depressed yknow but the animals you know yeah using the animals uh uh for therapy animal therapy um i mean dogs in particular cats um but know theres uh theres some animals that arent to be pets yknow um theyre wild animals yknow and yeah i saw a show last week on fox that was called when good pets go bad too

i hadnt heard that one well i did see on tv late news after youd gone to bed last night i saw where theres another airplane went down as it took off from kennedy airport it was uh an egyptian airline wasnt it and it had come to new york kennedy airport flew all the way across the united states to california for some reason then it went back all the way over here and then it had just taken off and what were they not even a half an hour or whatever out in the ocean where out out over the ocean and all at once the plane went whoom in thirty seconds or something i mean it was down from what was it thirty thousand feet or something they must have they had to have been dead before they reached the water because of with that sudden decline boy thatd make you pass out if nothing else would and theyre now theyre trying to decide was it sabotage was there something wrong with the plane was it pilot error and so i dont know if if theres gonna be more sabotage stuff going on the way some of those countries fight over there in the other countries and try to get us involved i dont know i hope not i pray to god that something then all the good people are trying to say no gods going to come back and salvage the world and all the good people will be here and probably the bad people maybe hell take the good people and make it a better world for us and the rest of them will suddenly die i dont know 

Recording: (6815/ 8002) 
<laugh> uh-huh uh-huh what instrument do you play 

Recording: (6816/ 8002) 
he ended up dying he ended up dying from um whats that disease aids thank you from the aids virus thats going around when he was near dying what did he tell his mother i wont use the exact words because there was profanity in it but he said i really up my life didnt i mom and hes got three kids three grown kids right now so you see what made him change what influence in society do that i dont know how we find it but i think if more people i dont think it was ever taught in the bible to do that was it and i i really dont think so and i dont ever yknow hear it im not that well versed when it comes to the bible <laugh> but uh i do believe theres a god and i do believe in prayer and i do believe in guardian angels watching over you and i dont think you have to go to church to really believe all this because its how you treat the other person that really counts and if i treat that person basically it boils down to treat the other person the way you would like to be treated 

Recording: (6817/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (6818/ 8002) 
my mom teaches there so its free tuition i get a tuition waiver

Recording: (6822/ 8002) 
no the lifestyle was yknow very easy to fit into and ive always been yknow interested it and yknow sort of like to the whole like european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and yknow studying english here is a dime a dozen and studying english in or in england is yknow sort of i dont know uh more uh sort of elitist which i didnt realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american and the classes were really small and it was yknow you i definitely got a feeling and a it there were a few classes that really stood out where yknow there was sort of yknow youd id hafta say something or id hafta give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh yknow what what does this american know and yknow it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes i mean not directly theyd never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of yknow that feeling of uh 

Recording: (6823/ 8002) 
yknow always something going on 

Recording: (6824/ 8002)

Recording: (6833/ 8002) 
im retired 

Recording: (6834/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6835/ 8002) 
would i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them things thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what theyre showing right now i think the world would be a place a lot better place and along with the politicians they stop saying now whats really best for the general public instead of well we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (6836/ 8002) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you <laugh> yeah yeah 

Recording: (6837/ 8002)

no big deal 

Recording: (6840/ 8002) 
but we still need to have property manager records thats very essential and a lot times when youre talking to engineers they dont realize that part of it um they dont like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether its been uh installed removed relocated whatever might be but we need know that how it had an impact upon the design of a the particular uh facility voice and data 

Recording: (6841/ 8002) 
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone thats trying to escape from cuba to united states thats found at sea is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not thats the accord and thats what thats what castros thats the premise hes operating on uh you know and the news media they havent really been a they just they havent been real objective about it i mean uh you know like there two fisherman that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you dont hear about him theres three cousins two of them think he should stay miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you dont hear about him i was reading about him news week or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (6842/ 8002) 
um yknow its stuff like that its like its kind of neat because you dont have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (6843/ 8002) 
yknow its like look you always think i could yknow look im doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (6844/ 8002) 
yeah thats what it seems i mean i know its like i mean its the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but just seems more apparent just because of how but you can like go outside all the time yknow i mean theres never like three or four months where you just wanna sit in your house and 

Recording: (6845/ 8002) 
yeah like its just its killing its own citizens its so ridiculous 

Recording: (6846/ 8002)

Recording: (6863/ 8002) 
three years i have them usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth for those language arts subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get phased out like right now im phasing a kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and hes very bright and hes still a terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what hes supposed to do and hes a good writer and usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context yknow so were in the process of phasing him out so that he wont have to hes had help i think since he was in kindergarten thats the other thing thats really an enigma about these kids ninety percent of the time their i q is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean theyre very bright but yet something isnt 

Recording: (6864/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6865/ 8002)

Recording: (6886/ 8002) 
warriors that are out there men and women thatll do that uh more power to them uh all i can do is pray about it and thats what i suggest to everybody else thats the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the nuns in high school that taught me had a poster on the wall that said more things are wrought in this world by prayer then well ever know 

Recording: (6887/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6888/ 8002) 
well if it didnt say i always look back and look at this there were how many thousands maybe millions of years before christ and here we are two thousand years after christ what makes us think we arent gonna live through this ten fifteen twenty fifty thousand years beyond i cant believe unless theres some thing like us our planet colliding with another planet or something that would destroy everything

all i remember is them talking about condoms i dont think they talked about anything besides that but um then again i could be remembering wrong um but yes that i mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean thats sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools theyre a little bit more realistic i mean this wasnt i mean it was a catholic school but we didnt have nuns or anything there i mean um yknow i think they were sort of more concerned with yknow it it actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a like eight grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they wouldve done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point yknow some sort of 

Recording: (6897/ 8002) 
i mean i i i mean that probably can be proven i dont know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that yknow it would be the influence of tv yknow the and then and another thing thats well tv is the uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now 

Recording: (6898/ 8002)

Recording: (6907/ 8002) 
right well thats something ive noticed in the local news particularly they say exclusively on our channel and stuff and its usually not that big of a deal what theyre talking about uh but theyre making a big point that you heard it here first and i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make

Recording: (6992/ 8002) 
wow um i dont know if there could be there are certain programs different community based programs getting but again those are my values as i say steering the kids into a church based program if they cant be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them giving them the guidance they need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where theyre supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families dont have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (6993/ 8002) 
and i dont agree with that either 

Recording: (6994/ 8002) 
and hes very opinionated and its interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing uh you can tell that hes thought hes uh thought about it and his yknow clearly formulated what his stance is on it and hes very articulate about it uh sometimes his responses are immature but hes nineteen 

Recording: (6995/ 8002) 
well it obviously i sort of surmounted that because ive been yknow i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i wouldve come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then yknow after that yknow you just sort of yeah get to the point where youre just kinda yknow laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then 

Recording: (6996/ 8002) 
selling time for money yes 

Recording: (6997/ 8002) 
yeah i know i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen in high school so we kind of grew up together and i didnt know anything else and um just two complete different people yknow different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (6998/ 8002) 
oh you didnt 

Recording: (6999/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (7000/ 8002) 
adoption is different i think though that when adoption is entirely different than when you can see but somebody elses sperm or somebody elses whatever uh because adoption means that i cant have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here it is again youre reaching out to your friend your neighbor youre not just forgetting about him and let the welfare or somebody take care of him and let him go down the drain and i think that thats what adoption is and and youre really accepting this responsibility and thats love and when youre trying and willing to have well some people probably argue about this but im sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody elses inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and youre already aware to a certain extent of what genes they mightve inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you dont <laugh> later on youll find out but it still you can go back and you can find the parent and i dont know whether theyre gonna be able to trace these genes back and say yknow later on if something happens to this child youre having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if youve adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

Recording: (7001/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7002/ 8002) 
some ideals ideas about it so i figure its something i should know about so <laugh> 

Recording: (7003/ 8002) 
i i i dont think its necessarily that i think its comes back to the lack of self discipline 

Recording: (7004/ 8002) 
um the reason that it was one of the best years of my life is its in a incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers in um i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions <laugh> as a matter of fact the thats only thing i difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something mundane like that its like i dont want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions 

Recording: (7005/ 8002) 
at cosi 

Recording: (7006/ 8002)

Recording: (7013/ 8002) 
my dad like 

Recording: (7014/ 8002) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of of of black people in many ways in retrospect it was trend setting and what it did in in even in putting blacks in um advertisements on t v young kids saw them uh and saw those ads and saw those t v programs and so it became uh a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now well look back on those t v programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical um but it im sure it does have uh some influence because i think it did it wasnt the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (7015/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7016/ 8002) 
and 

Recording: (7017/ 8002)

and a lot times unions uh they actually seem detrimental like to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because the if the union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy a lazy union as representative of of these workers so theyre more apt outside

<laugh> 

Recording: (7208/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7209/ 8002)

Recording: (7210/ 8002) 
no i you had women that working before you had women working before but self discipline is family its part of it self discipline making things too easy for us oh we cant do without it you ever you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7211/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7212/ 8002) 
and my sister lives in the middle of nebraska <laugh> nobody visits her <laugh> nobody wants to go to nebraska yeah whats out there come watch the corn grow 

Recording: (7213/ 8002) 
well ill have a <laugh> maybe when i im a hundred ill have that figured out 

Recording: (7214/ 8002) 
or does this say this yknow this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well heres a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal heres the animal i would be and heres why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and of what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he couldnt figure out how spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestibules 

Recording: (7215/ 8002) 
so um 

Recording: (7216/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7217/ 8002) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (7218/ 8002) 
yeah just since march 

Recording: (7219/ 8002) 
and theres lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls 

Recording: (7220/ 8002)

Recording: (7221/ 8002) 
existing area mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7222/ 8002) 
light news uh thats why i read tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a different perspective its its probably just as slanted but it is different youre right 

Recording: (7223/ 8002) 
then i 

Recording: (7224/ 8002) 
i think so because i i 

Recording: (7225/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7226/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7227/ 8002) 
and then wed go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (7228/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7229/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7230/ 8002) 
actually theyre they are working on it im sorry i didnt mean to interrupt you uh um theyve theyve um just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty level i think is considered um thirteen thousand pounds a year um and if if youre below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yeah so theres a bonus for back to work you mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for for whatever reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but um there i mean i dont really think and a lot of situations of course i im sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really yknow taking care of their children but unfortunately you dont really see that side very much you see the people who like their kids see none of that money yknow theyre left at home by themselves if if they can even yknow get them to school if they even go to school if theyre even bothered yknow and yknow those yknow a lot of theres there documentaries on all the time there so you really its sort of its more in your face than it is here at that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that yknow if a if a kid has bad behavior or yknow bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think thats the most ridiculous thing like surely thats not a punishment for a lot of these kids and yknow at least in england on these things ive seen yknow they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying yknow hotwiring cars at the age of yknow ten or something and i dont know i think i do have sort of very strong opinions about people yeah who are having all these kids and dont take care of them at all 

Recording: (7231/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7232/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7233/ 8002)

oh what are you doing that for oh 

Recording: (7272/ 8002) 
um-hum hum 

Recording: (7273/ 8002) 
um not really because i think yknow if if theyre going to theyre going to and i dont think a lot of them at that stage are gonna go out of their way to go and buy them so i dont think its like oh i have a condom im going to have sex i mean actually its this is is very hot topic in england right now because they theyve got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about yknow twelve year olds having babies and i mean there theyve gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing theyre there yknow they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically yknow passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just yknow uh because of the simple fact of the statistics that theyre they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be yknow safe about it 

Recording: (7274/ 8002) 
because then yknow what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think i at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if theyre working a lot of times cant get healthcare for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like people are always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7275/ 8002)

Recording: (7287/ 8002) 
its like like sometimes too i think about people you know they call and especially when i talk to this sometimes people call in and i i you know i get the same people or whatever every once in a while especially if like theres people have real specific weird names or something that i can remember ill theyll call back and ill think about them and its like how ill have this you know its like we have this weird like five minute relationship something like that like every couple of weeks or something and its like what to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like in the you know its like its real weird its like i know yeah get everybody 

Recording: (7288/ 8002)

Recording: (7299/ 8002) 
yeah ive run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school i went to i mean ive gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously ive run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just dont have time or dont have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7300/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7301/ 8002) 
uh okay well there few years ago there was this big fuss so ya know weve got to close some schools ya know enrollments dropping its ya know its the way population goes enrollments dropping we cant afford to keep them all going so lets close and they did this big study and they targeted some to close well there was a big uproar from the people whos kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close a school so the board backed down and changed its mind the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there wasnt the money for it so there was a big fuss about that then two years later they came out with another study it says well they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple then knock some down and rebuild em and its like every two years its a different direction and its like theyre almost afraid to take a stand that somebodys not gonna like well if youre gonna shut a school down somebodys gonna be really ticked off 

Recording: (7302/ 8002) 
i think theyve got more money i dont know if that necessarily makes them a better school um i think a lot of it is is is really what you what uh as far as as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it yknow my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced a p classes and and they worked real hard and and theyve got i think that they have options 

Recording: (7303/ 8002) 
dont get i dont think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they they raise money from the businesses in the community plus we charge for tickets <laugh> for people to come and see us and sometimes its sometimes we get a lot sometimes we dont get so many turns out the concerts we get the most the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we have childrens choir <laugh> because 

Recording: (7304/ 8002) 
now that doesnt make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts hell usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a c or a b i mean theres all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he cant study from them we even have a thing at our school that its it looks just like notebook paper and its got the three holes and the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but its n c r yknow the two copies

Recording: (7346/ 8002) 
where 

Recording: (7347/ 8002)

Recording: (7349/ 8002) 
yknow when shes in her middle years and tamara when shes yknow but yknow i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing its the one thing in life we get to do where theres no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or parameters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 

Recording: (7350/ 8002) 
well i dont know that thats a cause uh a it they they as a group uh and this was kind of a happenstance it this occurred as a result of a very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing it it was there was a happenstance and and part of this mass communication were talking about uh began with them and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and youre talking about uh a a greater inter communication id like to go back one step where were talking about when i made mention that three doors down you dont even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think thats profound as an individual communication we are nearing zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody inner personal communications thats the key in my opinion personal versus inner personal communications and its zero over here and were almost a hundred percent over here but when were in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate um john doe who speak here he hasnt the faintest idea who jane doe is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person over here thats jane doe that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson dont you remember old henry well henry was the guy that lived way over there on the other side of town mass communications as it is today they havent the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where old whoever it was lived over there i said so i think uh the i i think you need to distinguish between the personal inner personal relationship so maybe i digress too far there or who the next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7351/ 8002)

i dont know i think i really dont know i think in todays world what they call the nineties that uh its just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain things we did or didnt do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there was so many things that changed and some i think one thing like it stands out and this has nothing do with politics but its an example in in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i couldnt even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geometry and algebra youd think yet i used to get straight as in algebra and when i got to geometry i thought why am i taking this so that wasnt so good but still the way they were teaching it now and theyre reteaching it entirely different now and i think linda explained it how they were doing it with math here and said she couldnt even help him and so yknow its in the same way with politics it people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me its getting worse but then my mother used to say the same thing about our generation so i think its just a sign of the times i dont know what it is 

Recording: (7455/ 8002) 
yeah she she had a talk and my sister and i attended and i dont like the problem i think with universal healthcare would be everyone dont you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would go in yknow as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance it im not sure how you would go about doing that because you dont wanna put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year

um-hum 

Recording: (7555/ 8002) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (7556/ 8002) 
yeah um its awareness again i mean yknow put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of of college and then you put em with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean you cant even you cant control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can um put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and yknow and theyve got stairs up and down and yknow they get in their lockers and they bend over yknow and thats thats just too much i mean i think thats the first thing that has to be done take away that yknow they shouldnt even be uh that shouldnt even be a thought yknow and its distracting enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe theyre single guys that were just had a hell of a time in hall in college and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh well yknow you gotta look at that you gotta be more aware 

Recording: (7557/ 8002) 
she doesnt so much mind anymore i mean since ive turned eighteen i mean ever since then its been no problem or anything i mean shes sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (7558/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7559/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7560/ 8002)

Recording: (7564/ 8002) 
theyre like why dont you pitch you know be happy for the indians im like im happy for them thats fine but 

Recording: (7565/ 8002) 
but having having done it before yknow and uh knowing where i went wrong yknow uh that wouldnt happen again uh talk about all that shit for a while but that was again that was back in the uh actually it was in the nineties early nineties but yknow i was been doing it when we were we were as a recreation type of thing yknow not as a uh daily yknow um-hum somebody come knocking on our door oh yeah okay oh yeah oh yeah yeah stupid but id like to do something like that then uh uh i wouldnt mind having uh uh some kind of place for uh yknow you see a lot of uh different down and out type people and everything and and really nobody really trying to help them or nothing yknow and uh uh i like to think that maybe even this thing yknow could be like a sanctuary for them to come in and get some peace of mind or something yknow so um-hum 

Recording: (7566/ 8002) 
control problems of course theres always a leak somewhere yeah well it could be hot water they send out heat and hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that its drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and thats why it quit hm yeah then run quick <laugh> put plastic up oh i dont know it seemed like its a tough call because its very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of autoworkers you think of pipefitters you think of you dont think of such a wide variety of people and thats very hard to negotiate for anybody yknow when youre talking raises and lots of money like this which what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades arent real big participaters in the union yknow we just ride along and from what ive seen over the twenty years ive been here is it seemed that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longer yknow and so weve really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you cant work because they will take all the money you make crossing that lines so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made theyll take them to court and theyll yeah its against yeah its against the union contracts so you have just 

Recording: (7567/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (7568/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (7569/ 8002) 
right um personally i think its a good idea i mean uh i i mean to me yknow it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support yknow and that but i come from a completely different yknow background and everything else and the education and a lot yknow then most of probably the people that this would um concern but i do think i i dont know i mean with uh the birth control that is available and yknow all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for yknow these people who just have so many children that they cant feed they cant take care of i mean its not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can yknow protect herself if yknow the the man isnt willing to do it or whatever so and and and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7570/ 8002) 
um-hum

Recording: (7696/ 8002) 
civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion um yeah theyre on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal and fair society um some my leftist positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where where in the social stratum where you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these cla i mean i i dont want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations cause its not the exact same as say class was in the marxs sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job thats gonna buy a house for your family and let them live in a relative comfort i mean in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual

Recording: (7716/ 8002) 
yeah yeah i if if a there there cant be sanctions for doing the right thing and um uh so i would be im opposed to that i well yeah i i guess youd have to say that i was i be opposed to arresting mothers for anything um in in in that relation that its just that the effort should focus on on getting them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is theyre doing 

Recording: (7717/ 8002) 
so i mean its thats what im saying the uh i think its even american disabilities act talks about certain things about employers um and and with my lawsuit yknow with the uh the chill and yknow with all the public trials of high profile trials i think its education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work um is not fair its a rich mans person or a rich persons system judges are bought and paid for theyre elected um theres a lot of crap there and learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribes and thats thats not right so you cant when youre dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident yknow laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and its not right its not fair but thats the way it is so um i didnt wanna go into law <laugh> didnt wanna go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept hounding me and telling me yknow well maybe you could get in it to make a difference im like why would i wanna make a difference if it kills me yknow because i know myself and i dont put up with crap yknow i see a liar i bring him out yknow and uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and um unfortunately theres a lot of people out there that yknow they sell out their ideals and their principles for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out im not that kind of person and i wont ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life then so be it yknow i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there but thats yknow thats basically where ive been yknow um ive lived here my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball um due to injuries yknow knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro caliber yknow uh i played baseball with the with paul oneil and kent murker which are a couple of guys that yknow did get signed professionally and are playing right now um so at least i can say i played against them and uh least with kent murker i can say i hit a home run off of him so that was a while ago but that was when he was young and very good and i was i was three or four years older and still took him deep to center field so ill never forget that but uh i earned that <laugh> so thats um well um well that uh yknow i i dont refer to it as an accident anymore yknow theyre um my whole life it changed ah in every facet um from it um yknow physically emotionally mentally and spiritually um used to be catholic i dont follow that way anymore and um yeah i follow more uh ah natural way of following god nothing uh new age i dont wanna say exactly what yknow just say that the people this land long time ago before anybody came over here with their bibles and crap um ramming jesus down peoples throat the people of this land had a way of worshipping god and thats the way i wanna thats the way i follow um so a lot of people say thats native american or say thats indian or whatever yknow i dont care what they wanna put on it but its its thats a natural way of following god its the way i put it yknow worshipping that there and respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and uh so i went through all that all those changes and uh are still yknow coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to

Recording: (7744/ 8002) 
see it there again the business out foxed the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another trying to understand your neighbor more and spending time giving quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investments gone 

Recording: (7745/ 8002)

uhhum 

Recording: (7749/ 8002) 
like to me that was very strange 

Recording: (7750/ 8002) 
so hes gonna be somebody can complain about something well thats another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook yknow everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toast but yknow thats about all that they wanna do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook yknow they just do it because yknow theyre supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking and the wife does yknow whatever she does i mean it its individuality again so 

Recording: (7751/ 8002) 
<laugh> yeah it is weird like i dont know this microphones a little bit different so 

Recording: (7752/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7753/ 8002) 
i love it <laugh> 

Recording: (7754/ 8002) 
um-hum its at its at the same building actually its its its used for different things 

Recording: (7755/ 8002) 
no i mean the money yknow the money is great yknow fine its the biggest raise theyve ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went out on strike was a better deal than what theyve really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people didnt wanna be separated from the hospital they dont think its fair yknow that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so thats kind of a sticky situation because theyve always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget and you know the u hospital i can see where theyre coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and theyre thirty five million in the hole because they bought o s u east and all this but yknow its not the unions fault that they ran out the contract yknow and yknow so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wage is so low that its hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs thats yknow and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but theyre not willing to pay a lot of these people and yknow they think contracting is the way but youre always gonna have to have people here to because contractors just dont drop what theyre doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before theyve written up the work order 

Recording: (7756/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7757/ 8002) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (7758/ 8002) 
um i mean i feel i lean toward no i dont have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human rights side was that if theyre yknow on cocaine or whatever they cant make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (7759/ 8002) 
because see well ive had five babies yknow i really have to work when you talked about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape

to melt and soften the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire youve ever touched or been around and that fire is sacred its a sacred fire uh so thats why its possible but if it if i went down there with the laws of physics told me that those rocks couldnt sustain heat yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that theyre red orange glowing you gonna tell me theyre not hot so thats thats one example um

so in a in one way its kind of a blessing 

Recording: (7937/ 8002) 
for me personally um family being close uh both sides of the family are here um for me familiar familiarity i dont like a lot of change a lot of new things um for me uh i was involved in i i swam for o s u swimming an got real involved with the o s u sports an just the sporting programs an i love ohio state football so i i like the sports there a lot of activities to do to now with my little boy going to cosi and the zoo and just knowing where things are and how to get around

Recording: (7939/ 8002) 
well some of them are i guess depending on where they go but i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class that hasnt gone to preschool or daycare and she said it takes that kid up till christmas to catch up with the things the other kids come in already knowing thats how far behind they are used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name and your address you didnt even have to write it it you just had to know how to say it and your phone number and um recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills and that was about all they expected you to play cooperatively and thats about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten they expected you to know all that plus by the time you get to first grade youre supposed to have oh and the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them in order and recognize them you didnt even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred youre supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (7940/ 8002) 
yknow and they work hard yknow to make it easier on the students yknow totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (7941/ 8002)

Recording: (7943/ 8002) 
i mean <laugh> come on who wasnt picked on you know 

Recording: (7944/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7945/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7946/ 8002) 
flowers and 

Recording: (7947/ 8002) 
yknow 

Recording: (7948/ 8002) 
yeah yeah we probably eventually will do that but im like so up in the air about what i wanna do and theres so many things to do out there that i need to take time to think about it 

Recording: (7949/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7950/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7951/ 8002) 
well at the time when they were having a lot of trouble at school and they just wanted to get rid of some people 

Recording: (7952/ 8002) 
oh yeah almost always doesnt matter what um the disability is and i dont know why this is but they used to say eight to one now theyre saying more like five to one doesnt matter if its a speech impediment blindness retardation cerebral palsy deafness learning you name it theres five to one more boys than there are girls and we dont know why 

Recording: (7953/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (7954/ 8002) 
yeah now if you the the the thing you do is if you know the call sign 

Recording: (7955/ 8002) 
watertown waterbury 

Recording: (7956/ 8002) 
have you ever met somebody like that and 

Recording: (7957/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7958/ 8002) 
his dads a um a graduate of stanford um but he is um they they never leave there i mean thats an excellent medical school and everything but those football players theyre smart they they dont they dont quit yknow i mean its amazing they they never do 

Recording: (7959/ 8002) 
um a lot of good investments a lot of saving a lot of living well below means and i wanna own six businesses <laugh> yeah um his definition of retired is basically um he doesnt have to work he does but he doesnt have to so he just finished up a temp job up at uh qwest yep i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now 

Recording: (7960/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7961/ 8002) 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the seen and the unseen ill never forget it because i recited it for god knows how many years but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits they freak out 

Recording: (7962/ 8002) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something thats sensational and keep theyre making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (7963/ 8002) 
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow 

Recording: (7964/ 8002) 
um-hum um-hum that uh it it was like i say i said she probably probably thinks the same way yknow shed been here yknow and having trouble with boys and everything yknow when she was growing up but not probably would have could have probably would have been an ass about that kind of stuff youd think im not how bad they were yknow if they laid a hand on her of course yknow but but uh um but by her being away yknow then and her moms got a cool head on her shoulders she wouldnt let that happen unless she told me about it then shed be probably be afraid tell me that id catch an airplane flight over there or something yknow fuck the guy up or something 

Recording: (7965/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7966/ 8002) 
its the art school 

Recording: (7967/ 8002) 
ive heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (7968/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (7969/ 8002) 
so i dont know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with a bigger city when you get more people theres obviously gonna be some more problems um and uh i mean thats really thats really all that i know so its obviously a lot more build up its gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (7970/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7971/ 8002) 
okay so um chris and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people uh i got it in my head that i didnt want anybody to call and to say hows your dad doing and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call globally cross the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go cause how often do you get to tell people <laugh> your dad just killed himself this morning so i i hi how you doing no i havent talked to you in a little while is everything going okay actually no my my father killed himself this morning youre kidding so you you end up after a dozen or so people narrowing it down youve got youre kidding youre not serious no 

Recording: (7972/ 8002) 
yknow so they offered to accept me to med school here 

Recording: (7973/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7974/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7975/ 8002) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they wont allow dogs so shes not allowed to go over there so shes always like but but it does make a big difference so i guess thats what im saying for them 

Recording: (7976/ 8002) 
um as far as my brother goes i cant say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town um but usually hes either at work because he works fulltime then he has hes a part time student columbus state um so i dont really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out does his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as whats going on with him i really dont know but i know i mean theres nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that 

Recording: (7977/ 8002) 
uh well yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with and its like a form of censorship yknow big brother things librarians have always had problems with that uh i i dont know its its hard to balance it if somebodys out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else its i dont know how to balance it 

Recording: (7978/ 8002) 
throw nerf balls in the audience and <laugh> 

Recording: (7979/ 8002) 
as to what the sanctuary should be like <laugh> so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour our choir director um arranged it to about six five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we liked the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church downtown which was where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we didnt <laugh> maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good its certainly much better than old worship center because i dont know if youve seen a picture or anything of the church the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty and its yeah <laugh> its its flat theres a flat roof with a clear story in the middle it has nothing in just its just empty space over the over the worship center so when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all of the way to the back but if you were under this flat ceiling thats only about seven or thats only about nine or ten feet high it was dead> it was just muffled <laugh> and um it was terrible acoustically <laugh> but yknow we made do with it for many years and then um and then we had the the chance to get this input into this new building and its its uh its really beautiful its a circular almost circular big uh space with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh its its nice <laugh> well you could still go its they wont have they wont have a lot of um 

Recording: (7980/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7981/ 8002)

Recording: (7986/ 8002) 
real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 

Recording: (7987/ 8002) 
and that that makes sense and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game 

Recording: (7988/ 8002)
