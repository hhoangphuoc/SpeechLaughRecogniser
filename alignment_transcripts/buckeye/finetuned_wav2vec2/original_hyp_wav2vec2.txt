Recording: (26/ 8002) 
yeah but the ones that they really needed to do like tws when like seventy one in seventy i mean that i do not that is a bottle neck area you know and they really should have done something with that twenty years ago you know 

Recording: (27/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (28/ 8002) 
umhum push yo guet some many different students and well i like just walking over here today you know i just kind of thought you know i wonder how many of these people i walked by you know are going to be here in january because  you know a lot ofit because i did you know i thought we this it is cold now you know 

Recording: (29/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (30/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (31/ 8002) 
yeah weall it was just so fudy you know i know we hve talked too long but this is so much fun 

Recording: (32/ 8002) 
it was a nice birthday party 

Recording: (33/ 8002) 
unit does it um and it was not that i had a bad family unit it was just that there was not you know we never talked about it my sister and i were just talking about that because we were she gos we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and what not she goes you no t mr mom and dad handed me a book i am like they did 

Recording: (34/ 8002) 
umhum i think i i  a lot of vaccations i use hit 

Recording: (35/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (36/ 8002) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexhow i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay evor what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay okay where they gay before but they did like women 

Recording: (37/ 8002) 
only the only can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that but people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up are in a you know in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are n they are to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it it yeah but when they said that those boys we are makind those guns and the garage and the parents did not were clueless i just find thot really hard to believe if a child goes into a garage every night and you hear clanging and and they are buying gun metal and you know i then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a site on the internet 

Recording: (38/ 8002) 
i do know a few people that are gay um but they are in theire thirties 

Recording: (39/ 8002) 
we had the time 

Recording: (40/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (41/ 8002) 
i mean if we were that recist of a city then we would not be that accepting too gay pride marches and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back 

Recording: (42/ 8002) 
i do not think it is really i do not think it is really affected me i mean obviously there is amot ar places to go shopping or to eat or you there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to high schoo i went to public school 

Recording: (43/ 8002) 
umyeah umhum yeah 

Recording: (44/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (45/ 8002) 
yeah he is not getting the i do not think he is getting that learning he is he is more his that is his grandmother you know watching him and you know i wish that she would like do more of the learning things that the day cares do do you know but 

Recording: (46/ 8002) 
it is so funny that is what my daughter is idea we are gon down where icelik an say hum the could do th the the the yeah and plus 

Recording: (47/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i did not have back problems or anything like that but it watis just like the feeling it was like i am not right 

Recording: (48/ 8002) 
well it is not that there is been too much grouath i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (49/ 8002) 
well yeah it is i just give you a rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here 

Recording: (50/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (51/ 8002) 
what department 

Recording: (52/ 8002) 
hate crime is is nat is n intresting term um all crimes all murders are hate related i i am not sure  that is u it it is difficult i we had civil rits lawsad many people were opposed to those but at was a and an effort to correct years uhf institutionalized rasishem um and and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalizet hate but a crime is a crime oreyou know are you going to give someone who murdered mathew shepherd six life terms as opposed to someone who murder someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is allready a a law on the books i do not think we need to have i hate crime over and abofe that you know theth the the people who murdered mathew shepherd should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added in to it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affermative action programs and the bussing did to people is going to turn people against uh gays like that turn people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend tat the ohio education association h is very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you juis appointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this is ten fifteen years ago and she said now she said that was not my go my goall was not to change hearts and minds my goll was ta change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i wouldp the see an all white jury convict white men of con uh killing a black man we are not hearts and minds now 

Recording: (53/ 8002) 
yeah it is a 

Recording: (54/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (55/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (56/ 8002) 
nno 

Recording: (57/ 8002) 
eighty eight so we  we just had our lov ofth weading anniversary yeah 

Recording: (58/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (59/ 8002) 
he would be lost 

Recording: (60/ 8002) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with uh it is kind of like the small town thing which are haves goods in bat but i do not know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with that still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple of years ago and a lot of participation in that so 

Recording: (61/ 8002) 
and any more you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or buy a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (62/ 8002) 
yeah i think they are really helpeful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody rase angd kids can make it there is really but therye is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want ta stay on that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there is like nin you know theret was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know i thought 

Recording: (63/ 8002) 
< uhhuh 

Recording: (64/ 8002) 
uhhum 

Recording: (65/ 8002) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the haunking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a a debate about it but  we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (66/ 8002) 
right right but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute you know< it is so obvis hello  but y yeah 

Recording: (67/ 8002) 
vey very much so now twenty fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would caught we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we just defined socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are no longer a o democratic government as defined back there then uw yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition it is developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (68/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (69/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (70/ 8002) 
walks away 

Recording: (71/ 8002)

um he moved to texas because like he was moving into the lake he was going to smu there and like so i moved back from from florida back to u up here because i did not whant i did not wan to go   him to texas ec texas becas texas iis terrable and like um so then like my mom wa ses like my parentis got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (73/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (74/ 8002) 
mrighttrang 

Recording: (75/ 8002) 
since march too 

Recording: (76/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (77/ 8002) 
because i went to origon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialists than they are capitalists and they are easier to deal with thand they are more reasonable people in my opinioni u rore reasonable but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and and all i am the minority an myi family  believe me and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (78/ 8002) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have a family in haway we have family in virginia beach so 

Recording: (79/ 8002) 
and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in a clumbest coated fabrics plant which is plant that makes l coated fabrics they make uh ther main thing is ah auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rollling machines that roll this stuff out and there is fumes came off of it so they had a big hood andn exaust system 

Recording: (80/ 8002) 
dos n i mean 

Recording: (81/ 8002) 
no uh 

Recording: (82/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (83/ 8002) 
umhumreadnn i do not know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was called a lot of little things < 

Recording: (84/ 8002) 
you know a historic building there a like  there is no history in america you knoww 

Recording: (85/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (86/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (87/ 8002) 
right now but i knew him when he was eighten months sober and he ould work every day 

Recording: (88/ 8002) 
yeah so it she is funny because she is gained twenty six pounds and it she does not lookk pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today 

Recording: (89/ 8002) 
i have never heard it  said before like you said that that the reason women are not prece is because they do not show any kind of uh spiritual leadership i i have never heard that said and there must be people who think that 

Recording: (90/ 8002) 
but they just do not have those 

Recording: (91/ 8002) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (92/ 8002) 
but if you love  if you love someone you want them to do what yu right and you want hem to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also and othr wards you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away buth murder but this one o erher i am not gong to let t get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but ind i love you dearly but i trye to teach you diferntly do not know where you went wrong and d not want it di wrong what ever but you got to pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere i but now you said family yes i think the reason and that it al age we ca look back every one was born and every one was loved by a father amohem ra when they were little and how they are formity of years are and the education the um the way they were  uh paught as they were growing up does helpemty be o  what that president is what that polity any politicion is any minister or anybody else it  the way you are raised i firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it it is it bears on everybody so that is h way it really begins with the family 

Recording: (93/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (94/ 8002) 
okay uh i have been in collumbas since nineteen seventy seven and uh i am an air traffit controler and i have three more days to work before i retire i am i i i am retiring sunday so and tomorrow is my tirement dinner so little nervous about what i have to do there you know they have told me nothing except show up so 

Recording: (95/ 8002)

Recording: (100/ 8002) 
so beit ye  we hade the riberters out there helping out the the gi is fine team effort was not it but then after g guys came home the little they went back nto the house and business sawl these idal lines to hey we can do something here because in those days a little lady said well i will o iwil do alo od job you mean we went a littl think mom would do pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad i was a  primary bread winner but she woul gout and do some od jobs just to complement their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spiend on credit uh maybe them jumpig to him myself here but busines said hey let us produce these lines a little later you want a refrigeratorm we can make it for you and we can make iat cheap for you because we can mas produce it

Recording: (112/ 8002)

Recording: (116/ 8002) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (117/ 8002) 
ol my my sister is particularly religieous and that that tends to warp her view of everything 

Recording: (118/ 8002)

Recording: (122/ 8002)

Recording: (135/ 8002) 
you wered you had to go home because mother was ill 

Recording: (136/ 8002) 
tha and i i imagine that is about half and half right now aor maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is i evei  at and neveo lution at this time tell you the truth what is going to cause the world to end i think what they really mean but by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will in the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will n be more compastionate toward each other and jus be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody geting back to really believeiing there is a god and believeing that you should take the other person into consideration and my sound very bastic but it is very th  very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this like you said me me me and i got y have this and that status symble stuff and really if we older people could get out there may be and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids bucause i know i myself in my own home i have been a collector now i take this back to the depression years bhen i did not have any thing and my father one time when he is out tof work i guess what i do not kno what whell of her age and se it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first dall baby i ever had and i remember when i trid to wash a thing olf that little doll it was one ofthere is a sort oa molle tan the water and my my mother is ai well ihaeyou do not now o ti take care of but any bete n nowte n never boug you d nother one hed beliveing f she did not

Recording: (138/ 8002) 
uh two h we never used the word aer < but u i am sure  playing people use the word on us you know but we  we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but um in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a meatriarky one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would v go go along withher you know but uh if u if uh we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would eryand i then and the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life it was 

Recording: (139/ 8002) 
n we start them over again they have never learned and the reason why i you arethrowing ta care itd out too much in fron fhem without saying hey you have got to do this to prove this to me now we we we have lacked a one hk a lot of ethical moral standards in this country we are losing it every day and until we start looking our selves in in the mier at night and say i am proud of myself i am problo what i did i may not i made a dollar a day but i understood somebody a day

Recording: (197/ 8002)

Recording: (250/ 8002)

Recording: (251/ 8002) 
well you know my and my girls ther are certain products that brand name like uh one of hem i know is the mir uh pudding that you can uh take i for lunches which they do and it is like adventure you know adventure but  ad ten  well every once a while hunths will be the same price and he will be a cupon in the paper so joiyce will oh sh oys o we we  trade she gos to th rocry store once then nexet stwo week is igo and then next wo eek she goes so uh she wil you know she will buy stuff like that with a cupon nd she goes and i go wy are you buying that she goes it was cheaper than the mir brand and then when we eat it it is like it is too sweet you know or it is too overpowring or too shugary and the girls eve hn th sameway that we got we do not like this it is too chocolaty so you know like the mandwich stuff it is like they just pour shugar in it i guess t  because that is what people like and so i find that the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but it is all like a mier brand or something like that or food club or something like that yeah 

Recording: (252/ 8002) 
well i think sometimes that it is because tha child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been thetine a person n ta utalye  i never told my kids not to do something that i am myself was doing example smoking cigarets or taking a drink a beer or taking noa wine with my din nrs y y now you r no or olde a bhat i can now there are some things that the kids can not do it this age is somebody can not at another age buossiblat i go out on a date for example well who is going o but pory wocaand i well he is already sixteen year as old andn wagt to youor sixteen years old and you will fee lot to go ot a par is bas buy that ti am al expectiy wou  abl you know not know what to do uh but i  mean i never did uh and i kno well i will not give you any ex camples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would tryam swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i woul try i very very hard and i got taught one time that i ha b btter watch a litinm more ecare fully buy my one little girl ah but anyway i whoud always and i ho appollogize if they did catch me doing something that i have be telling them know you cannot do i would appologize a saying mom he was bad af momma did that i got suup in my mouth one time becuse < well well  o n now i mean now if you want to hear the story in funny wel over tv just teen bit i was bicking a py and i was taking this py out of the oven i was a cherry piper and aple  piy oune of those that can get jucy sometimes and i had not put any aliutino am poiler and they anyther to catch it and just s i started to get it out i spilled it and i said i i od worrid you know and just as i said that wored leeny down here here is two little shoos 

Recording: (253/ 8002) 
well i do think axcess is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves bhut it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation  not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while becau people would be you know doing illegal things toget guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much outlawd guns excep for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course there ar si am floating around but the fact that you can pretty much seccessfully do that obvesly ing ons such as small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me and but it is true i mean the fact that you know the access is just there is almost nothing baret and i mean just the amoun of people that i just heare sort of you know in conversation talking about oh yu i you know getting a gun for security and all this suff it is like you know ut your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chans that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (254/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (255/ 8002) 
but it is a would you say it is a  say it is a nice place to visit but you wold not want to live there or would you actually live there

Recording: (257/ 8002) 
think what 

Recording: (258/ 8002) 
as uh h a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what her moral beliefs were 

Recording: (259/ 8002) 
oh okay 

Recording: (260/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (261/ 8002)

Recording: (263/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (264/ 8002) 
< i do not really have any childhood recollections of caifornia yah 

Recording: (265/ 8002) 
no because um all the kids take that californi california achievement test ond if you are familiar with that and it is like you kow because it is say like you and i i go to school you go to you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in collumbus and we both make straight days well when you take the california achievement test that really tha ais mea nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned thi schoor on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really schoor exceptionally high on those bcause you know they always pick on columbus cublic schools they go oh it so lookt ol abot ther  tes schoors well you know if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i do no kno what it wt woul be but let is y just say it is uh brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad and probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in crison so they live with grandma how do yo expect them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not a uh you know i an oager anything but you know i always keep tabs on my kids you know like i have always gone to conferences even though they got straight ais i go to conferences and teachers gow what do you come for and i go i if i do not come then it is like saying o i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand ais i just demand them to do their best and i said yo know if youar best s to see then that is what it will be but i said if you re bes is an ad o are gting to seye you got me to talk to so um back to the brown school uh they are kids like my daughter there who make straight ais and when they take the uh what it in that thing the proficiency test suome through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have uh th this probably sounds really buiest are big a but  then you have the kid whos mom and dad are not together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes the proficiency test he gets like a 

Recording: (266/ 8002) 
oh it will be 

Recording: (267/ 8002) 
where northland is 

Recording: (268/ 8002) 
every kid an my kid ran around whath i knew his parents one way or the other 

Recording: (269/ 8002) 
i mean my my kids went to a school that when my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditory am and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it is reached the point that is decision is made and announced and i meand there wre good reasons for it uh and they explaind the reasons and you know at some point you yo have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when it is inevitable 

Recording: (270/ 8002) 
the musty nes the od 

Recording: (271/ 8002) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (272/ 8002) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all righte how to make a peanot butter and jelly samdwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table and the front they did not know i was going to do this so after they get  all done d i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and y bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelley and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no addlibbing no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote

Recording: (275/ 8002) 
you played saxaphone in the band 

Recording: (276/ 8002) 
nd not knof the other coaches did either 

Recording: (277/ 8002) 
and so it was kind of funny but but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (278/ 8002) 
yeah well yeah yeah i mean it happened a lot and um i hav had two abbortions one illegal and one legal a 

Recording: (279/ 8002)

Recording: (280/ 8002) 
oh george oh duba i do not know i have not really formed an opinion i can not

once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot 

Recording: (282/ 8002) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid is going ta hat you forever 

Recording: (283/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (284/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (285/ 8002) 
sa you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 

Recording: (286/ 8002) 
yeah they are very quantitate of as supposed to like the quality and then so the analisis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that is what i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my busines classes i can not stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter  how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well tl in in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire new employe and if you have constant turn over things like that then in if you have a product and but because obviously people are not going na care you know so and they theyr they seem very close minded like like this is the way business has to be but the professors do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (287/ 8002) 
they did not they did not bring that uh he only gave ten cents 

Recording: (288/ 8002)

Recording: (327/ 8002) 
no humans are violent by nature i believe i mean people have been at war since the beginning of maan it it is more or less greed that causes violence it is not media me just like the extacy was an advertisement showing what you could do tv is showing you violence that you could do if you were driven to it 

Recording: (328/ 8002)

Recording: (361/ 8002) 
well i think in general like let us say if you took ah handfull of executives from bordon or atnt or some place like that you would probably find that in general they are very concerned 

Recording: (362/ 8002) 
yeah but um just to see the church might be fun um we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worship center building and because we were really too too big for the sanctuary that we had 

Recording: (363/ 8002)

Recording: (364/ 8002) 
you know they all get uh sideline and side track by special private interests and that is that is the bottom line and it is sad but there is so i i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we end it up settling for 

Recording: (365/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (366/ 8002)

Recording: (377/ 8002) 
one sid 

Recording: (378/ 8002) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she is gon to have the rest of her life um i will tell you what with today is wor old and some of these fourteen year olds thewill look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and know they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is jist for them to be able n to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age seventeen maybe you know i think they should have a parents concent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it is going to be if she is going to be a young mother and then eventually may b be not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you known there ise so much of that for a while they are that was go wan on and is like you i can not believe these women are doing this you know they jus snap < 

Recording: (379/ 8002) 
oh you have  it is like mean i en after i hear that i said w it is not even worth going it th they are gon no be ruid

Recording: (688/ 8002)

Recording: (689/ 8002) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we till have this on linge thingwhere my fa in fact they have been real unhappy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plain trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year tou they s bend a week with my brother ant setera it cera and they come herea couple of times a year  and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times in twenty years and it is because they do not want to get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in and acuran and maslan and they stay in cincinnaty and they stay in springfill with my sisters and they wal not do it because it is just too much they do not want to have to deal with that traffick they do not like that and it is and just recently i have finally  sait you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually called them on i am fifty two 

Recording: (690/ 8002) 
somewhat 

Recording: (691/ 8002) 
uhum yeah i yeah if it is a nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (692/ 8002) 
<< 

Recording: (693/ 8002) 
oh < 

Recording: (694/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (695/ 8002) 
yeah yeah they they all all af there is actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look so i  just saiy there is little details that are different and 

Recording: (696/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (697/ 8002) 
would say there would be certain life application things that all cood should know but not i do not m think that you can say everything you know you have everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (698/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (699/ 8002) 
she believes no man will love you so much not to cheat and i do not believe that so i am not with her son <

uh it is not really an office he is like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sihtes he he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and and then he gets to um talk with the the other contractors and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sihtes 

Recording: (701/ 8002) 
he is going to he is going to be there all summer yeah i did not decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner um and found out that when i checked the websihte for the scanner that they are just simply flat out not making win e is two thousand drivers fror my scanner so it is a um fri i do not know i just got it i can not remember what it is um paper report i think it is paper report avoid window is two thousand at all costs stick with ninety eight much better much better operating system <thatis

Recording: (704/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (705/ 8002) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (706/ 8002) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like whatre they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have was take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up and i do not know what i grew up in but i wl i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebod ythey goes hunting and fishing and drives tracks and wears bal caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know culture is all different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or yoyou konot they mean that that the are something different um except the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (707/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (708/ 8002) 
i think it is important to know what the persons values and customs are and to support whatever it is and thy i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed to fhace the north star or they needed to have this thing above the bed are under the bed and i mean if it is important for them to haf prayer then i think it is important to get the upperprk people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (709/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (710/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (711/ 8002) 
but it is not gong to work i mean they if you are around people i mean numberon they are around their parents and their ciblings and that is socializatio you go to church or to the library or whereever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their per is opinions because i i for one example the pokimon crase my son that know what pokimon was and tell he heard some otheir kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid it is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh ways cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean  you know wat i mea because it is like they they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about i ho he must be cool because some other kid they are talking about it but then hee i sided that it was ot cool said i was my influ our influence on him rather than the peers andflencs on him

so i became a r business major 

Recording: (933/ 8002) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those or at least one of the two had been in counseling and had that you know was doing it aggression management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe keep a closer ey on what they were doing so i think you know to that degree you know the parents should have um you know were sort of responsible and also with like their kids disposition i mean you know would you knot notice some different or something like that was going to happen on mean depending on  you know how well they hit it or whatever but um i think at that point though you are you are so influenced by your peers 

Recording: (934/ 8002) 
right well when i was teaching taking teacher edu education classes here u and observing class room teachers um they would always tell me you need to give a grade for class participation

Recording: (1045/ 8002) 
because not only is he a shopin is pig but he is a bigget too < ariza is yeah so 

Recording: (1046/ 8002) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a formufill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule ethear goes an the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (1047/ 8002) 
she just wants to get it overwith 

Recording: (1048/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (1049/ 8002) 
actually i was not even nhot siure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up ban i said oh this sounds cool you know i had thought of myself as a uh chemist for a long time and but this opportunity came up yeah i wad applied to like other places and i got anhe universty of chicago and i wanted to go there and then this came up here and also  it is just ridiculously cheaper here i did not want det after undercrt thit s just pathetic  um my counselear just kind of found it and he huld poasted it and he especially um tried to knotify the national mar people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other one t like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of themi at printston right now you know they are all off at their ivy leages like basically working their buts off to get in when i am mured yu and < i do not totally understand itye 

Recording: (1050/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (1051/ 8002) 
um  hatiluky 

Recording: (1052/ 8002) 
i never learned math < we had and in fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their timeis tables whe had a big pisa party plan for 

Recording: (1053/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (1054/ 8002) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (1055/ 8002) 
no no i am i am interested 

Recording: (1056/ 8002) 
um i think some of it was not i think a lot of it is you do feel lonly um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any frends or you feel totally different i mean i still go through that i think we all go through that to some point or other evhen yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind ey i think that is part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrong doing and your child is eys you need to really admit it um i mean you do not want to do that but 

Recording: (1057/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (1058/ 8002) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home 

Recording: (1059/ 8002) 
it does t yeah 

Recording: (1060/ 8002) 
yeah ella in that laine avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky to run across her 

Recording: (1061/ 8002) 
and they are not accurate 

Recording: (1062/ 8002) 
even harder 

Recording: (1063/ 8002) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want no have a room to all mysellf you know i do not want to go to ome place were i wuld no have to leak deal with somebody s so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home 

Recording: (1064/ 8002) 
so she is very limited on working in clotshed corners and stuff like that uh so she is basically disabled and that goes when they do that it is because of your education and also they take in consideration everything 

Recording: (1065/ 8002) 
really umhum i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have nown about this twenty years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (1066/ 8002) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is co it is just columbus it is just columbus i maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here um do not realize how i i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not sanfrancisco there is a lot of places it is not but it is u you know it is not a backwater either wealthy need to get out more  i mean you know all this oh we will never be a major lege city until we have major leage sports it is well i you know i guess u getting out more would not help those peopl it is um um that that would be h you know that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and um i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i i i really do think people do not take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (1067/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (1068/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1069/ 8002) 
to put into it 

Recording: (1070/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1071/ 8002) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having ta wait until they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (1072/ 8002) 
uhhum 

Recording: (1073/ 8002) 
lthat is great 

Recording: (1074/ 8002)

that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1076/ 8002)

all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on except the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that

Recording: (1159/ 8002) 
oh yeah that was a that was ha job helping them to move 

Recording: (1160/ 8002) 
no kno but tha bu that iswhat a saying but that is that is wat am the saying han the saime thing his happening when we had a bussing we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in i nice environmen oh they they got the taste of it and then went back home uhm and we did an very injustice thing to those kids and to the families and then when we broke them up we did something else you know taok them ou own we lost that community involvement so now the parents can not follow hour kids to their activities a get in m splitting it up ay we do not ant  we do not wan a families that is a mis numer they said the fm the community raises the family the kids yeah that is how they whant you think but the  the community will not verevy replace the family 

Recording: (1161/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1162/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1164/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (1165/ 8002) 
okay okay 

Recording: (1166/ 8002) 
t that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible monstrocity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them yeah 

Recording: (1167/ 8002) 
and those the the other students ware lost to the system and that is what happened with him 

Recording: (1168/ 8002) 
umhum yeah because i could not imagine roling over on 

Recording: (1169/ 8002) 
a even republicans were like that 

Recording: (1170/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1171/ 8002) 
no no but 

Recording: (1172/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (1173/ 8002) 
mo that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (1174/ 8002) 
chan a we just had a man who took time just 

Recording: (1175/ 8002) 
o okay 

Recording: (1176/ 8002) 
are they but they all look a lot 

Recording: (1177/ 8002) 
h they uh stopped federally funding uh osu that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and workedfor the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people moved like to arisona and california and and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years until i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to r uprop my daughteris out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (1178/ 8002) 
so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i would call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that cry an spell but he did go ho that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (1179/ 8002) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (1180/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (1181/ 8002) 
umoh 

Recording: (1182/ 8002) 
well and 

Recording: (1183/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (1184/ 8002) 
is the way i feel 

Recording: (1185/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (1186/ 8002) 
yeal 

Recording: (1187/ 8002) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (1188/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (1189/ 8002) 
she figures well you know that kind of makes up for me not working so 

Recording: (1190/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (1191/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1192/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (1193/ 8002) 
you are talking to people all over the country i mean you are becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world 

Recording: (1194/ 8002) 
oh my god 

Recording: (1195/ 8002) 
and they were in itally and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy in vinom that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude af mos the guise that went to vinom was a little bit different from from ar probably as a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1196/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (1197/ 8002) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation you know mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his and he said his dad told him about conthems you know so they are going nto make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus what the intornat and everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents stillif youare going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (1198/ 8002) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (1199/ 8002) 
um up until march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him and our home and then my grandfather who is ninety five got um ill and my aunt had to choose between my son and my grandfather and um she is watching actually my grandfather is doing quite well now but she um watched him so we now have him in a day care um in hilliard 

Recording: (1200/ 8002) 
yeah and 

Recording: (1201/ 8002) 
um in general i think i think the united states has i a fairly well developed like cls not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (1202/ 8002) 
lower that is right you have been to utraa< yeah 

Recording: (1203/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (1204/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (1205/ 8002) 
whenever he runs well i thought he was going to be elected uh mayor too but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but um uh you know he is got his constintuants and they are going to reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes a mistake as saying labeling thing races that are not  necessarily races but anyway 

Recording: (1206/ 8002) 
uld not even think about asking 

Recording: (1207/ 8002) 
and 

Recording: (1208/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1209/ 8002) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because you are black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same thing wi it is like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know youre roots and where you came from i mean i do not can not see i being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (1210/ 8002) 
i have to get a job and support myself so 

Recording: (1211/ 8002) 
is it 

Recording: (1212/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (1213/ 8002) 
grandview has it is own school system too but 

Recording: (1214/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1215/ 8002) 
so it brings that and it is like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools i will bet you they are all about the same 

Recording: (1216/ 8002) 
umhum umhum wow uhhuh umhum well i have i have two uncles that are suthern baptist ministers < and it used to be when we would visit them in the mid sixties we would have to go i mean if you visit your  if you re relatives visi and your minister you have to go to church  and uh but the thing is is southern baptist uh service always has that period where you are 

Recording: (1217/ 8002)

Recording: (1218/ 8002) 
some imb 

Recording: (1219/ 8002)

Recording: (1366/ 8002)

Recording: (1574/ 8002) 
yeah i just renewed myrtificut last year so i may t ack nto it part of the reason i renewed my cirtificut was i did somec chome instruction with ha columbu publics schools las year and that is kind of like a tutering job where you can go interrange hours with the student that is at home for some reason uh i had one that just had a baby< and uh they it is an interesting job because they looked for somebody that can cover the most technical lik uss subjec that the student istaking in my case at turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once ind it it was uh algebra to another time < nd bugt they expected us to at least they expected me uh to cover the other subjects two or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was histery  so it really requires you to be well rounded < and i i like kind of like that uh i have taught in a couple of other places uh ommunity colleges  college in new work i cought a chemistry class their and  community college which is in hillsboro but i taught it ther branch and i taught a introduct an introduction to a collegy class theire and an introduction to uh introduction to the arts was called < and that was interesting it was  thether it is kind of an under class of teachers they do no pay you know nough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hhour  and  in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six con tact hours a week and they wer paying something like twenty one or twety tn dollers an hour  so

Recording: (1578/ 8002) 
i think there is been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think  even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the wright thing by taking them away from the othert the cousins i mean they hae the cousins have been stressing all i mean hen needs family he needs san well there is not much closer family than your father and i hi  they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you  agree with them or not uh i i i it was very unfortunate the way it happened i but i think the government should not allow to g low to go on as long as they had 

Recording: (1579/ 8002) 
umhum yeah me  mom are real close 

Recording: (1580/ 8002)

Recording: (1583/ 8002) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i wold say he knows more than most kindergardeners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedual right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we will go ta different web sigte sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometymes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is hhe listens to everythi< 

Recording: (1584/ 8002) 
and he said even in h when he was in high school that they hav they had police officers there so that is not like a knew thing but he said you would have people w like nives and youwould have people with fist fights but you ul like guns it was unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh they re people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it you know like i do not i was i did not feel that way but i would like in retrospect i lookd back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day it was like so tramatizing to them lhike that would be like for four years every day you are just like teezsed or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you i damt knot justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (1585/ 8002) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposly tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from hillard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad 

Recording: (1586/ 8002) 
well that is it is competition to be earlierst and the the federal government is trying to s stay out of the state s face and so again thit is another one of those things that just live with it i mean there is enough there is enough things to do and fight in wort life that that is not worth it you know

Recording: (1622/ 8002) 
no because i think there is the ideal and everything and if you can live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now um i mean i i could never agree with abortion let us say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stan by but i guess the burth control isyou became so personal and um it was just a decision thati had to be made and i had to make it with a what i thought was a clear concience and what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (1623/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (1624/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1625/ 8002) 
yeah you know that is that is the thing so i think there is being aware and then also like i said with with ll the i mean a and i am and i am so opinionated and this two and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through and i i see lazers and i see cols and i see sers you look through and you say oh okay you know you are ooking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women in bralls and hey re looking at the camera they are seductively looking at the camera and you are like okay how many wo how many different brawls do women really need that itis not for the women i am sorry you know most women by the time they are buying brallsd know what choices they have you they do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men the men is heads are usually cut off they are not wearing any kind of revealing underware at all i mean it is just so un equal so we leave these these guys are these poor boys that are growing up we push all thi an you know and then expect them to deal with it you know nd they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach eir kids and that goes back to the government an society and and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait until those kids grow up and and wait until those people that we are pushing the free speech get s moged ore you know anything else happens to them

Recording: (1645/ 8002) 
yeah so 

Recording: (1646/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1647/ 8002) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (1648/ 8002) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body thet should be in the body way up here in the in most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (1649/ 8002) 
ou h i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in origan and i always dadored marcap fild i did not vote for hewa there was a weasfa because i thought he was a great republican uh < but i think uh personally my collman was good i iv met uh well m we had a diamand jubili at the village and and colman and teter both cameman ne bot i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i did no think that but there was much that much difference in them ida logically i think yhou know she woul do  just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but um i in terms of having a blackmer i think that is goold for columbas ihi

Recording: (1653/ 8002) 
i mean i i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i a ways think of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred ad eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the other way you know and it is  you know 

Recording: (1654/ 8002) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to hi yeah there is a lot there there iss way too much shared experience tot to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe s like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (1655/ 8002)

Recording: (1685/ 8002)

Recording: (1828/ 8002) 
yeah yo  a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for an very intelectual interesting environment but people are trying to live symply there and i kind of agree with that < 

Recording: (1829/ 8002)

< 

Recording: (1879/ 8002)

Recording: (1880/ 8002)

Recording: (1881/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (1882/ 8002) 
if they want to get married that is their business i do not think it is mine or anyone else to say that they can not

yeah 

Recording: (1897/ 8002) 
umhum oh 

Recording: (1898/ 8002) 
while saying while puapooing everything and saying this is dum and stuff as as far as bringing the two together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1899/ 8002) 
yeah it was like freshmen in a sofhimore year 

Recording: (1900/ 8002) 
oh yeah well i do not know < 

Recording: (1901/ 8002) 
you know i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never want to you know ever say anything but um yeah that 

Recording: (1902/ 8002) 
what we are animals 

Recording: (1903/ 8002) 
yeah i would i would say you know life applicattion things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english or math or you know i can not believe i am saying this history but < i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as muc emphasis on it i think more of mphasis should be on life skills and just be ing able to make it on your own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that those other 

Recording: (1904/ 8002) 
then then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (1905/ 8002) 
uh it is a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot there how hot who knows but it is been such a strengthening spiritually strengthening thing it also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out on your body because of that heat um it gets all the crap out of you 

Recording: (1906/ 8002) 
oh boy like action oh fight the bad guys yeah and now it is uh you know like looking and ia sort of postulating deeper meaning to yo lin what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metifore and for things in real life uh and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and appon our culture i think it is kind of interesting and now that it is coming back out uh you mea ki look at things from a little different perspective but i mean you know of the maybe i think i have done about ten twelve paintings of which i am like consider to be done and and like 

Recording: (1907/ 8002) 
yeah andd i do not know if it is quite that bad  but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are not are not approved of  mean i am not real up on that so 

Recording: (1908/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1909/ 8002) 
all right 

Recording: (1910/ 8002) 
than would be with the black president and i think it would cause problems um i do not know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (1911/ 8002) 
ist six normal kidsbecause elld kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1912/ 8002) 
so ha 

Recording: (1913/ 8002) 
uhum 

Recording: (1914/ 8002) 
and uh then theh powers tat me an  american army decided wellwe will grow up to this little area of uh oh i was air six month or four months enzeo 

Recording: (1915/ 8002)

Recording: (1916/ 8002) 
san diego is probably what yeah i have heard that is a nice place 

Recording: (1917/ 8002) 
ou know not that what you wear makes you but he just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1918/ 8002) 
you know so it is you know if you if you have a problem if you want to talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1919/ 8002) 
< yes pets are 

Recording: (1920/ 8002) 
< you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know gorgea worl nineteen eighty four and big brothers under them at all u my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who was not but i do not think god is goin to come down and do that so you know tem we can not really decide that but to be honest i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tubstiders is pretty permanet u but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still not still much cheaper than the am having kids u and then if they i would give em more money if they woul clean it they are ac just for them um as far as it being rasis i do not think i think they are missing the the point because i am sure there is some run away white teenage girls out there too or mexican or what not um 

Recording: (1921/ 8002) 
ah i have got a son he is a senior at auterbuen 

Recording: (1922/ 8002)

Recording: (1931/ 8002) 
it is a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (1932/ 8002) 
oh  yeah they gave us ten thousand there is a dollar have fun 

Recording: (1933/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1934/ 8002) 
no that is not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that that a lot of times you can do things like counceling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1935/ 8002) 
but she is yelling that everybody is prejudiced against her and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1936/ 8002)

Recording: (1941/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1942/ 8002) 
yeah and uh i had the prerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money yoauh know but the bad part was is the university is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raisers and everything so at least you did have an increase back thennd nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1943/ 8002) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person youd just have a different way of going about it  probably 

Recording: (1944/ 8002) 
i have seen the uh big amphitheater and was that uh h what is that the opera house yeah right right on the rigt on the was the ocion or whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1945/ 8002)

Recording: (1947/ 8002) 
uh once  she was through with her pregnancy but she did end up just go to a public school 

Recording: (1948/ 8002) 
uh essentially all the big academics most of the i am it is actually  all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1949/ 8002) 
u would be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bugs 

Recording: (1950/ 8002) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (1951/ 8002) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them own and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes some different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live an a day and time when there iis a pill to help me concentrate they look at like whell on of my friends have to do anns say w any way im to do it you know they look at it like it is a big pain because they got a run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting the time released one here is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out ind the time release and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release and it wears olwf and it does not do what i isup pose to do so they go back to the six hour doasage you know one  the morning on at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pil and then their lake to the lunch lwine and you know they just hate it so  but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess he aren denial just like we would be they say wht does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what are the things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1952/ 8002) 
umhum yeah um i i think they could have i  think she woav got a better education out there uh now it saint lewis chool public school dosine yhe probably distrct s prbably ougt ave o had the same i here but by being curkwood you know ratherr tell lir a smallanori uh i think we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class you know so uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know uh then i would have had a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1953/ 8002) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does not i mean i was surprised like i  i have never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one actually

nless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1955/ 8002) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (1956/ 8002) 
when i did school levy campaign uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the viggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school leviy get a list  of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i oudo is register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i wread a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i hauld known that when i was in college and work so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i could not vote until i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had to wait until i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that you know worked and dit some volunteere worked to get that whole thing changed if i woaud known that they were not going ta vote ad eighteen and we are going towait untill they were almost forty i wad not to i wal nt have wasted my time uh but anyway um you you get parents who ere usually younger especiully of the the first second third grade age 

Recording: (1957/ 8002)

Recording: (1987/ 8002)

Recording: (1988/ 8002) 
i do not n i mean in if was my money so why should it matter

Recording: (1990/ 8002) 
henderson olen tangy 

Recording: (1991/ 8002) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just everyone there is a a bad dark side in the story so children just tart and i mean it is in there that and then including my own daughter she and i sware i had her watch mis der rage but now that she is older she watches tv she is addicted to d tv something terrible ind thi so of course her children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have have tv when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really gos you know and but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is face any more as a matter of fat i am getting so i do not watch the news 

Recording: (1992/ 8002) 
um< 

Recording: (1993/ 8002) 
absolutely 

Recording: (1994/ 8002) 
i went to here one day and at my lunch all the time for two weeks and they paid me ten dollars a day< 

Recording: (1995/ 8002) 
in what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you know so 

Recording: (1996/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (1997/ 8002) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (1998/ 8002) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and youae got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1999/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2000/ 8002) 
one thing  okay go ahead well  one thing uh  i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe lots lots of people do not is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (2001/ 8002) 
so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figure hat would be a deecent i mean it translates over because we are in some musters it will get allth messt up there but it it is it is like i am halfway to three fourths done with the with my degree so if i wantet to transfer now itwould be like because i i after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits wil not transfer over be a waste thof time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just figure right now i should look 

Recording: (2002/ 8002) 
yeah and yeah so i 

Recording: (2003/ 8002) 
well i have meted a lot more different cultures seeing how a lot more different people lived and found out how lucky i was 

Recording: (2004/ 8002)

Recording: (2012/ 8002) 
for two buxks you know you can not beat that 

Recording: (2013/ 8002) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way it does not mean it is the right way and um i yeah i you know i really strugle with that because i come more from i think the famili should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going no do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um < sounod like my dad bit seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids should not be

which i feel has been com like comletely devoict in america because of the effects of the cold war u i hav inherented of this world where there were uh uh uh harm iy going with this < um i mean the generation before is had like ve um he protestedd against it and i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before buti mean when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear becaus i am not gs iaclly sure where i am goingthi i am very cinical of uh about about the world i have inherited uhbecause i see a world in which my political views have been silente by fifty years of uf you know like international politics uh i in sort of lik propaganda um that isays you know like to be left of a certain point is bout  u like among conservative cercles the word liberal is is like  almost like colling so in a communist in in the forties um where as i am very cynical about that because e they feel thatit it was not it it it is been a cultural process that has been developped and now i am being handed this current situation which i see as completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation s sy cinical o the reason i am cinical is because we are handed ta world in which we see the injusticses of the past or not the the the hipocracy i mean i guess in justice id  also applis and terams of things like the cold war and stuff it that is why i am cinical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i kno not kno i feel kind of pret like this is my position and

brother 

Recording: (2302/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2303/ 8002) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtowns i mean you you know it seems like youu just drive through in two minutes and you are out so i do not think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so 

Recording: (2304/ 8002) 
umhum bhut well that is a bunch of < that is just one of those miths< i think that is to make people feel guilty or something 

Recording: (2305/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2306/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2307/ 8002) 
yeah yeah then there no e w be no desire yeah 

Recording: (2308/ 8002) 
byalag experience 

Recording: (2309/ 8002) 
i have keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go outwest or you know have because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young i am five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking eleven years old 

Recording: (2310/ 8002) 
you know do the screeny 

Recording: (2311/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (2312/ 8002) 
has not for about four years he refuses to refuses to live with us because we have rules 

Recording: (2313/ 8002) 
no because they are going to learn that on their own um i i personally think that it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homo sexual and um you know  i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and bobabla because but i have also known people that were that way and now are haderar sexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just ha choice they made and things like that um so it is in today is day and age they are going to learn about it quickly 

Recording: (2314/ 8002) 
i do not think forcing prair on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (2315/ 8002) 
i i have heard it it has not been as i have heard it from less reputable sources 

Recording: (2316/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2317/ 8002) 
uh so there is always something going wrong with the wairing or the plumping or the something and uh it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house that older house as but no no not anymore < 

Recording: (2318/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2319/ 8002) 
but go o 

Recording: (2320/ 8002) 
i 

Recording: (2321/ 8002) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (2322/ 8002) 
i  uh so it is really surprising to to hear all this about en you know 

Recording: (2323/ 8002) 
they never saw it they never said anything about it 

Recording: (2324/ 8002) 
oh oh wow oh see and she is probably really good

Recording: (2329/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2330/ 8002)

Recording: (2331/ 8002) 
the milk a caw 

Recording: (2332/ 8002) 
clinton vill

Recording: (2340/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2341/ 8002) 
pro check wota pobably like um wuld hav patched

Recording: (2347/ 8002)

Recording: (2487/ 8002) 
i have always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (2488/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2489/ 8002) 
it is more feasible than a six year old 

Recording: (2490/ 8002) 
yeah  exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (2491/ 8002) 
yeah  well wh what my opinion on our whole penial system is just you know well it goes along we are not we are kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now and we are definitely n nelecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they nee to obviously they some place some point they have uh learned in correct reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh they need to have cychological help period 

Recording: (2492/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2493/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2494/ 8002)

it is it is it is a it is kind of a oasis in the middle of the city 

Recording: (2500/ 8002) 
oh that is it 

Recording: (2501/ 8002) 
but it dis not bother me uh religion is basically everybody what i was in there back in the sixties o you  moyu know everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either caslick or something like that but uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspoken to s on moslimng muslins and  uh islam and uh jud i in judiismand everyting is uh and there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you you got to meaet yourself you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know if you believe in religion you r youre here temporarily pom eturn or  later on you know 

Recording: (2502/ 8002) 
but she was never interested in you are never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or make up and clothes and things like that you know you are setting yourself up for ridicuole an high school for that and ni sorto hames she would come home in tears because the kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple f monthsj she got her gd 

Recording: (2503/ 8002) 
and they see the same thing it is meared back to them because we are mading christs images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do positday and build on the posite it may have been the smalllest part of that sheet of paper

Recording: (2507/ 8002) 
yeah they are they are really good about that 

Recording: (2508/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (2509/ 8002) 
u know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just wanted to start off with something easy and um they only take national merit scholars in there 

Recording: (2510/ 8002) 
in the world 

Recording: (2511/ 8002) 
mean she gets up if she gets up it wakes her up at five oclock and she does it all day i never i never peped not once  i was < but it was like the feelings like i am hungry right now  that bothered me because i was not like a real heavy eater and then all of a sudden it is like i wold not eat that and that and that get me this and it wat was crazy it was weird

Recording: (2729/ 8002) 
if they are especiallyifthey are over forty because theire companies giving money back to the community for this and that and you know that is how they are trying to show that they care about this they are trying to mentour some school or some group of kids or give money for the down troden or you know but you are right i think it is terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do better science skills than we do better language skills than we do well canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve you know and i just think that this proficiency thing is finally going to make people accountable

Recording: (2769/ 8002) 
so because he and i always discussed politics and stuff

Recording: (2781/ 8002)

Recording: (2890/ 8002) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (2891/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2892/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2893/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (2894/ 8002) 
yeah so you know his friend lives on the other side you know it is like a duplex and  friend lived on the other side and he uh he also was uh broken into but they came through his bathroom window 

Recording: (2895/ 8002) 
very big < i mean probably down the line because lake we are still struggling to get up you know we are waiting for that million dollar check there the 

Recording: (2896/ 8002) 
sa i almost bought one um a lack couple of weeks ago in fact i i went into contract on it with this guyhis dear old man who is it was for his mother who was in her nineties and a retiremet n it was on royal forest which is north and i made this the slow offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i f like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i a the baby coming and weare gong to be busy and i did not want ta get involved in and so i made this offer and thin he countered back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he counterd back an nine ty six and i said you know i thougt w gold o have towory about it he is never going to come to it so i wrote back and said you know i appreciat r ofver but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two if ive was really f the only thing i could  i could do and i did not even give him the time e to respond because i just jussumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2897/ 8002) 
uh will not ly there uh lot of happy strippers in town so or shouldo say exotic dance o 

Recording: (2898/ 8002) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that iis being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there in things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over powerful as far as  the number of guys being out there they are violent i mean it is something an it unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2899/ 8002) 
so now he is back in the lawan care until something else better comes along 

Recording: (2900/ 8002) 
yeah i contribute it to too many people there is too many people there is not enough commitment it is too easy to get divorced and um the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of um just people everywhere and young people today i do not  you know i do not know what the statistics are going ta be but they i do not think they have a good idea of what marrage even is you know before and also before marrage was a commitment to uh a type of life style and that life style s gone everybody is independent everbody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that i is looking in the same direction you are and as equally as independent then it might it might work but um i you know and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (2901/ 8002) 
oh that is great < 

Recording: (2902/ 8002) 
umhum rt 

Recording: (2903/ 8002) 
sohe 

Recording: (2904/ 8002) 
rit 

Recording: (2905/ 8002) 
so i you know they pile ay you resemble that remark ar you know 

Recording: (2906/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2907/ 8002) 
yeah but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother is name was harriet 

Recording: (2908/ 8002) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy cozy i have a 

Recording: (2909/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2910/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2911/ 8002) 
every day the other one i do not see that much any more 

Recording: (2912/ 8002) 
yeah ex medicated i think i think it is 

Recording: (2913/ 8002) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (2914/ 8002) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get to travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really want to see chicago is not that far washington is not that far um new york uh you know i do not get to new york that often but um you know i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i want to go to the trouble 

Recording: (2915/ 8002) 
his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (2916/ 8002) 
well i think all through growing up there is always been you know different kind of kids 

Recording: (2917/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2918/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (2919/ 8002) 
< do youhave it at three oclock 

Recording: (2920/ 8002) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general are family 

Recording: (2921/ 8002) 
yeah i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of them is from their parents but um it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not w realize you know they iare old guns that they conpiscate and they do not realize where they are going i mean not amazes me um but there is always gong tao be the underworld tand different  ways that kids and people can get guns and it is sad i do not know how we could ever limit that but there is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help exspecially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but you know you it is liken identification thing you know 

Recording: (2922/ 8002) 
and yet we sit down and theggotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the um sponsers are just as bad 

Recording: (2923/ 8002) 
oh that was a football game deal 

Recording: (2924/ 8002) 
the that is why it is mainly appealing to instate people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2925/ 8002) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2926/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2927/ 8002) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough the ollists or something you know an instrument like that u but they they we usually get enough to play consert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalist for last few rehearsals umhm so we sort of have stringgers i guess you would call he  yeah we have actually been on dubios u also uh radio on music in mid ohio um are recording last year an of bathoven is ninth got on music in mid ohio< yeah we used the auterbine college quire  uhum 

Recording: (2928/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (2929/ 8002) 
and come back in 

Recording: (2930/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2931/ 8002) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should  get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (2932/ 8002) 
um collegewise i do not know anyone of college age that is gay 

Recording: (2933/ 8002) 
<time to go l right i am down here 

Recording: (2934/ 8002) 
oh i would not be surprised 

Recording: (2935/ 8002) 
oh i have to eat it that is like < 

Recording: (2936/ 8002) 
i kno 

Recording: (2937/ 8002) 
right she jused woned her last year 

Recording: (2938/ 8002) 
uh uh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in tolito and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (2939/ 8002) 
um and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that is still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um so i do not think i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger more comfortable movie theaters and and that kind of stuff a it has not really 

Recording: (2940/ 8002) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrust back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (2941/ 8002) 
because concievably they wanted  what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (2942/ 8002) 
well let me ask you uh about somebody else who is not that well known do you know jon gorka have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is he is funnyhe has good songs he is a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arlow guthre or somebody i mean he he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does a coostick and um he writes most of his own songs yeah and  if you ever see something buy him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection ask to listen to it he has funny funny some of the songs that ae really funny and some of them are the saddest things thou have ever heard yeah yeah just just tragic things < um let us see fny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows < um let us see  uhi can not think too much of them right now bu uh yeah 

Recording: (2943/ 8002) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love than you know you should not do it 

Recording: (2944/ 8002) 
no usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2945/ 8002) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her her husband was out in problems and my kneece is a eight well she was in fifth grade and there isa elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarets and everything and i just am like oh ma goge 

Recording: (2946/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2947/ 8002) 
sofimore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master is 

Recording: (2948/ 8002) 
m 

Recording: (2949/ 8002) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well uh so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age tof they would be adopting them they obviously what know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (2950/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2951/ 8002) 
but it is min bogelling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in myg senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams you know it is just min bogeling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know af handfull of people and do not know anybody else b like you know a lot more of a tihtnit group hatis a job so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (2952/ 8002) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on other i think it is been very good because at least let is us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that if you increase your knowlege you are far better off htha to stay in this little hole over here and this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (2953/ 8002) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and a 

Recording: (2954/ 8002)

Recording: (3065/ 8002) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of beging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is really easy life 

Recording: (3066/ 8002) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (3067/ 8002) 
nowi gotthem 

Recording: (3068/ 8002) 
think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am no i do not consider myself rases at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things ti you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there that need love and

eah four girls 

Recording: (3080/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3081/ 8002) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only think that is going ta happen is it is going ta chuckle down and you are goin to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy then one family that is miyserable and they fiht and then you feel like it  you know people say my fault because thits happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not know that is a totally different perspective just to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (3082/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3083/ 8002)

i think example is probably the best um they see that you care and they learned to care i think my son jon he is the youngest i think he is a very compastionate soal u very spiritual young man um more so than his brother is and then i always have have to waiy that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better to give and i sometimes tryd a way that if that is part of why i i i can not believe it is an attention getter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do but um but maybe just within maybe one feels u and i think i think it it is a matter of being concientious to you know concientious that there are

Recording: (3204/ 8002) 
ah 

Recording: (3205/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3206/ 8002) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so ant so age an they sort of give backround on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one start of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on than they are telling you u so i really do not see a big problem with the way the americ is going or whateverf the uth um and like  i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because an past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (3207/ 8002) 
and uh my oldest sister started a school out there 

Recording: (3208/ 8002) 
umhum

Recording: (3219/ 8002) 
umhum umhum yeah i guess migh i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own carreers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals and the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it thereor whatever and the kids um they ire basic where they learn things as their peers they do not get t everything in stild at home uh that is pretty much what you know i seeing talking to my husband and you know and there irs so many broken homs and single moms and trying to to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (3220/ 8002)

Recording: (3258/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3259/ 8002) 
i was married but i did not have any kids once you are have kids you an not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off any time and then when i got my master is i ran into an old friend of mine who teachers in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need tha resource room teacher won uce you come up andn interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviwed for that position a got another position but anyway it all worked out 

Recording: (3260/ 8002) 
an i think pbly eighty four 

Recording: (3261/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (3262/ 8002) 
now i do not see that kind of raises them at all 

Recording: (3263/ 8002) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what iy mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal teen and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost at much younger than seventeen you know  i  eleven twelves like   we even look like  o forget it but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (3264/ 8002) 
it is it is interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had main arange she was at a auter bid then she maine arrangements that uh she might have to be in the hospital takeng a final with one of her teachers that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in or you know it is just too much stress for me to even think about<< 

Recording: (3265/ 8002) 
umhum he was he did some assistant coach work at uh oeshu far was yu ho really like that 

Recording: (3266/ 8002) 
yeah umhum 

Recording: (3267/ 8002) 
iste apulatia area um it would be great if somebody you know they woul  want to pump all this money and to i n unfortunately whentever the government pumps money into an area you know that tends to be like a uh foreign country gets it you know and 

Recording: (3268/ 8002) 
huh 

Recording: (3269/ 8002) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (3270/ 8002) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (3271/ 8002) 
yeap 

Recording: (3272/ 8002) 
umhum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to js tell the teacher i am supposed to get an a what is wrong with you  << what is wrong with you 

Recording: (3273/ 8002) 
uum no you i feel funny that i am i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years since i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (3274/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3275/ 8002) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (3276/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3277/ 8002) 
um there were one or two 

Recording: (3278/ 8002) 
e that is what i 

Recording: (3279/ 8002) 
you know < 

Recording: (3280/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3281/ 8002) 
uuyeah 

Recording: (3282/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3283/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3284/ 8002) 
yes umhum 

Recording: (3285/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3286/ 8002) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (3287/ 8002) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (3288/ 8002) 
< yeah yu should be wer aware because the school has a big  impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (3289/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3290/ 8002) 
i i would find i enjoy is one of my my favorite classes actually for for an elective 

Recording: (3291/ 8002) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couplef times and i do not know he just impresses me more than algor 

Recording: (3292/ 8002) 
i think more of what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean ive really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism yoursel serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean i some cases it will even chain you up in beatchan public for it u and i think not just sound too aventual but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with tat um i think just the fact  the the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they are going to get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you aren you are not even going no get thirty days in jail and you are going to be like go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (3293/ 8002) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack uh  on the bottom uh with a bair hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know h my the mosed effective penaltyfor me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and you know it left marks but it sure it hert i mean it would staing and i understood eexactly what was mentand i think i grew up and i bended up being i think a quite successful person and i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty do going deecent kids and none of us were injured and if us were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it it was not something ot truely her injured uh now today however uh i suspect my mom could easilly be h could have been charged with abuse if a child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that uh green w it was always a green switch because of the the the olde ones they would break you do an r  brak < 

Recording: (3294/ 8002) 
yeah right < 

Recording: (3295/ 8002)

um i mean at that point i i certainly did not have any real knowleger about any of that sort of thing um you know they covered the basics um they did talk about condums and um contreception i remember we watthed a film which everyone was very embarrased by um i mean i do not really u they i they did send home a package to the parents because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom to talk with me about it 

Recording: (3322/ 8002) 
uh and uh decisions are happening to her without her making them and um i think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her hands on 

Recording: (3323/ 8002)

Recording: (3333/ 8002) 
one of those 

Recording: (3334/ 8002) 
we went back to our room and we watched a movie my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer um 

Recording: (3335/ 8002)

Recording: (3336/ 8002) 
you should be getting pretty near 

Recording: (3337/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3338/ 8002) 
yeah exactly so they so i i said well you know i went to i went to uh padre island < because  i decided wht i did i did not want to getn you know it is in texas  so 

Recording: (3339/ 8002)

do whatever i want to some degree 

Recording: (3341/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3342/ 8002) 
well actually anybody can try you know there is a civil service examp you have to take and they place you on a list from that you kow like say if you have an eighty well everybody that takes it after you that gets an eighty one it is going to get hired before you do and so you can take it again but if you sqore lower you have got to keep that lower a score so that sometimes people are you know kind of apprehensive about doing that but ah once you pass that and thend they say you know the government goes okay we are ready to hire a thousand people throughout the united states well each region there is regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region so they go down the list the first thirty and they call you know they are rieat each one of themand say we are offering you a position you  do you want it or not and you know some of the people have said  i have been on the list for two years and i have a youknow i you kow hve a job and i do not want it now you know so and then those people have to go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program which is really hard because at one time only forty percent of the people are making it through that 

Recording: (3343/ 8002) 
no she did she my exs wife did uh i would have prefered he wold hov get continued going to school but she had some problems with some students and stuff and

Recording: (3348/ 8002) 
i did not realize that 

Recording: (3349/ 8002) 
ow wat is a part of the reason but 

Recording: (3350/ 8002) 
i remember a time when i wasa brand new teacher i was maybe fifth or sixt year of teaching that is still pretty new is jon i said jon what is yur last name he said guess i sai do not feel like guessing tell me your last name he said gas i said jon i want to know your last name and he said g u  s s i am like oh sorry thank you << 

Recording: (3351/ 8002)

Recording: (3352/ 8002) 
uh four twenty five 

Recording: (3353/ 8002) 
i think i like if you had to ask i would say i was a straight midwestern suburban i but there are people that i go to school with and ashlant is twenty five thousand like in the city 

Recording: (3354/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3355/ 8002) 
but it takes away that big trip um we have been and then his brother got married in hawae so we went out there  so we have just done the honeymoon uh gisney world th albecurkiy a couple of times ind why but we have plans to go to europe he he wants to go to england and things like that and i wantt we are looking into greeac 

Recording: (3356/ 8002) 
i i think 

Recording: (3357/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3358/ 8002) 
talk a cornta grow but uh that is how i see uh < ye on the regular crop they had when they were out there my parents was kids 

Recording: (3359/ 8002) 
but< 

Recording: (3360/ 8002) 
uh girl im works for he will sonhans amagin 

Recording: (3361/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (3362/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (3363/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (3364/ 8002) 
ohh 

Recording: (3365/ 8002) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (3366/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3367/ 8002) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of yourself aor others and i think as you as we become older you start thinking about how uh much your weknesses are but really your weeknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here o uh professes to be the thing 

Recording: (3368/ 8002) 
i would just tell him that is just a filling he is going through hoh  you know i i went through that were you know you you look aut a woman and youre you she is attractive to o you know but that is just something tha is going through your mind and  i think at is like the devel getting into you because i wouldt never sleep with a woman i would never do it even thoug i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or knot drunk and just you know i would just tell hem that is something he is going through and that is  wrong for him to do that an he you know he is a man and that would tell them god did naot put too men on this earth and if he would ch choose to do that that i would not hate him or disown him or anything like that 

Recording: (3369/ 8002) 
i went to oyu for about three months but i just got out of high school you know ut o you now 

Recording: (3370/ 8002) 
ll as it turned out he expected us to play the solos < but it we did not play the whole pieace we only played one movement of it and um i thought it came out pretty well i have it recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset < 

Recording: (3371/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (3372/ 8002) 
he will bas yeah he will basically tell you he do not how no father except for me 

Recording: (3373/ 8002) 
i do it so 

Recording: (3374/ 8002) 
r 

Recording: (3375/ 8002) 
ere in collumbus yeah  i have always lived in collumbus yeah 

Recording: (3376/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3377/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3378/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3379/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3380/ 8002) 
yum umhum 

Recording: (3381/ 8002) 
what is different i my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle it was i mean  stills my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oldand ten ville i am right in where i always was i mean i am i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a  full circle there but collumbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other city is of course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (3382/ 8002) 
uhhuh< 

Recording: (3383/ 8002) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones  just every one of them is different 

Recording: (3384/ 8002) 
south pacific yeah 

Recording: (3385/ 8002) 
it is in in education it is it is top they preduce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education bsane schools coming up lik they are building a new building but by i will be gone aby the time it is non if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for a small school and they just open up with their pghd program and education and they are also nowng for political science but it is a real conservative political science andike it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things uh like they it is dry they have uh real strict visitation policyies things like that and my thought is ifyou are inif you are if you are considere an adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember wan i was a freshman in colleges we did crazy things but still you know 

Recording: (3386/ 8002) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (3387/ 8002) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (3388/ 8002) 
if if you did not own let us say on a school leveand you da i you pay taxase i always begetecause i rent and i always get very upset an i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yess i do because every time a school tax passes my rentd goes up it is build into the rent uhat least it  it aught to be ore i have a pretty dum landlord < uh and i wdo not i have never lived any place where my rent and did not go up after a school leviy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levie was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because the do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation uh a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh youre democracy could go down the drain uh that was why thommas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virgindioa and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you now but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talke to some ah almost college aid students and they do not see the relationship you can talk a logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them yand you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (3389/ 8002) 
umhum yeah i well i think basically that gos back to uh you know the parent hing and everything you know there was something missing in the uh uh the child is life you know uh uh that he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building bonds and inder basement and mom a dad notn know what was going oon you known mean uh it is just a tragiony i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do noat know uh welleven year s old or something like that well an accidentala shooting ou  and he andnot uh uh another friend of mine fr  sayinge same clife you know uh he pulld a gun and shot him you know did not know ta dame thing was lotit but ad they were talking about another thing about that you know where somm kid i guess that happened just here in town uh couple  of them but a week ou go or something like hat you know wor a guy shot at kother guyu but u mean those things are just senseless crimes or you know an who is really  a faultn who s realler to who is guilty i do not know uh i wou like to af uh annot to tey ever would ofe but if if wone of the two that you i calamba and you know if they would have sor vined i like to seeng what was going through thear aheat you know but that is something whoe knover knu 

Recording: (3390/ 8002) 
hatwl be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (3391/ 8002)

Recording: (3394/ 8002)

Recording: (3395/ 8002) 
and then there was another girl who i really did not think was that smart she wis kind of um in her blond and she got in yeah 

Recording: (3396/ 8002)

Recording: (3400/ 8002)

nobody around nothing but land yeah 

Recording: (3502/ 8002)

Recording: (3510/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (3511/ 8002) 
great yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this < so i will get that little slice and take the rest so that worked out

Recording: (3520/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3521/ 8002) 
yeah lik have someone come and you know and tell them  you have this s much time or you know i would not recommend you stay on this program this long and i i i know there is programs that if you get on that and they pay you you have to pay thet money back after you get on your feet well i mean i think someone should be able to come out and and tell you about these things and let you know what you can and have to do to you know do this 

Recording: (3522/ 8002) 
but  wearenot really hard in soi at 

Recording: (3523/ 8002)

Recording: (3525/ 8002) 
yeah a lot more 

Recording: (3526/ 8002) 
yeah yeah i think it was just a political thing 

Recording: (3527/ 8002) 
takes a lot of time 

Recording: (3528/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3529/ 8002) 
well you can carry a weapon here in collumbas i can carry a weapon right now as long as it is out in the open 

Recording: (3530/ 8002) 
r mom is a severe alcoholic 

Recording: (3531/ 8002)

Recording: (3532/ 8002) 
i mean that is a neighborhood malan

Recording: (3537/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3538/ 8002) 
umhum uh they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it and most usually i just put location i do not want to go certain places uh 

Recording: (3539/ 8002) 
yeah like when i need things and i call them up i kneed dipers  wipes ined twenty dollars yeah he is there for me for that financially uh he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3540/ 8002) 
no have no idea where he was uh and at the time my mother inlaw was in a nursing home and had alshimers and my fatherinlaw was in the hospital 

Recording: (3541/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (3542/ 8002) 
nd it would take like years i would think to implement the program successfully< 

Recording: (3543/ 8002) 
umhum life skills < 

Recording: (3544/ 8002) 
so like there is no there is not a lot you reallyou can really do with that < 

Recording: (3545/ 8002) 
umhu 

Recording: (3546/ 8002) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things thi ran into to arcitecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to rite 

Recording: (3547/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3548/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3549/ 8002) 
but it is a uh smaller caslic school you know in saint louis so 

Recording: (3550/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3551/ 8002) 
yeah it is well basically it is like ah it is about the size of a very small hotell room and then it is got a stufpe bathroom with like a big bathtub and there is like they is  li o it the room ith theripy which is a little box on the while about tit is bige that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is anough rom where people can come and sit down there is like a fold out couch bed for whoever is in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3552/ 8002) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3553/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3554/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3555/ 8002) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years youar a junior and senior year and um like your junior yo oul go in the morning and you are senior o yould go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you ware at the cur centerd thend you go 

Recording: (3556/ 8002) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to would probably be more towards the education line 

Recording: (3557/ 8002) 
i mean my the middle brother was always around he was not very social in high school so 

Recording: (3558/ 8002) 
nd there is peple is lke that today still you go but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh uh and uh sit down make a visit to them every week make at part of their life and divelup a friendship 

Recording: (3559/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3560/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (3561/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3562/ 8002) 
it is just very comical i was just like oh 

Recording: (3563/ 8002) 
yeah okay 

Recording: (3564/ 8002) 
i turned him into a zambi 

Recording: (3565/ 8002) 
no commitment  these guys have commitment and you see the guys out there they wan may go further possably in their careers and professionals others want to maybe folfill something whatever it is you ask each in individual what is that drives you and that is a thingyu n i guess so parturbid interviewers they aske somebody and then and somebody come s aid you now i mean yeah uh what did  now i do not get in side the guy is mind i do not wa what did he mean you know t yi mean yeah know i do nt now what you mean you know play dum it pulled ol of them what do you mean uh wnmico red what do you playn on doing after school when i was growing up they used to give the great pint average and the major of the uh the uh the student of the student aleth 

Recording: (3566/ 8002) 
a little bit of both i think i looked into some phonicxs i went to the library checked out some phonic tape let him watch those because b kids love to watch things < and just reading with them and going over things and it is it is been amazing just to see it is like the lightbo comes on and 

Recording: (3567/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3568/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3569/ 8002) 
yeahyeah 

Recording: (3570/ 8002) 
good< 

Recording: (3571/ 8002) 
in your room it is just like forty of any other kind it is plenty 

Recording: (3572/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3573/ 8002) 
umhum me too 

Recording: (3574/ 8002) 
yeah exactly you can bring that in house i think i mean i do not know i might go out like like we said ad be completely rong so 

Recording: (3575/ 8002) 
because that that is happened where he is like i will not do it again and and he did it again i feel like once a cheatder re always cheeat er to me you know maybe maybe to ha next woman he will no do that too but he is gotten away with it so many times with me i feel like he would not really do it you know 

Recording: (3576/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3577/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3578/ 8002) 
and i have got friends that do that and i just i do not i do not feel right t want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff there is no way uhuh 

Recording: (3579/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3580/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (3581/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3582/ 8002) 
well he is uh exportaint cars illegally 

Recording: (3583/ 8002) 
so we am kind of doing that and then i figure i am probably gointo weight cables at night  and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (3584/ 8002) 
i know those are halls 

Recording: (3585/ 8002) 
ell i live on the southwest side and work in doublin i do not get tho campus very much i get the campus but it is usually up to the os stadium dbs stadium uh studios 

Recording: (3586/ 8002) 
um i probably would like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3587/ 8002) 
< you doitsid 

Recording: (3588/ 8002) 
oh sure uh 

Recording: (3589/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3590/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3591/ 8002) 
guess 

Recording: (3592/ 8002) 
but uh her mother stayed with us foror several uh two or three years and she was a baby setter for her oldest boy 

Recording: (3593/ 8002) 
and it really is not though because wen because  i think it is actually it is really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can get along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has er prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life <for everyone 

Recording: (3594/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3595/ 8002) 
that is that is yeah at is developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they hve found out that the full dominance does not take over until about eaige eight 

Recording: (3596/ 8002) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school was when you really learn and try to decide what you want and do with yhour life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers were not there and they had to cleand they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feeld that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know kids a lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents worked i am not sure if the combine if both parents worked but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally helped now 

Recording: (3597/ 8002) 
okay so you are you are higher up there than i would be 

Recording: (3598/ 8002) 
now like i tol heri she whay i was raisedwen 

Recording: (3599/ 8002) 
u forties like the limit hm 

Recording: (3600/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3601/ 8002) 
it is that is why i quit 

Recording: (3602/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3603/ 8002) 
yeah uh a it is to to me that is sort of a slap on the rist and you tell the parents what you have done it that the kid did and you do not want them to do it again and let it go  they suspended i it i do not know of course w m mrer pobably say this i got this version of this story from the collumbus dispatch so it is probably not ther whole story  yeah < it is 

Recording: (3604/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (3605/ 8002) 
see and i can not eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to losvegus with my dad and i we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind of glad she did antd um the smell fish always kind of bothered me but until i uld tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out in to a rash i mean it was like a heat rash it it started on my neck 

Recording: (3606/ 8002) 
cand you really 

Recording: (3607/ 8002) 
yeah not really i mean i go to like  i go to this club access sometimes i mean that is short north whatever like it is okay um like i do not know i mean the red zoneis downtown over that  er th do not go that ii do not like that place but um i do not know uh kind of the winter months really kill like doing anything like really any o like foot traffic type things i mean in the summer it seems at it seems in the winter it seems there is more 

Recording: (3608/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (3609/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (3610/ 8002) 
yeah because i have like a problem with getting to know people you know like um shy at first 

Recording: (3611/ 8002) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3612/ 8002) 
and uh it did not hurt ma not you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you knows your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood even you know how many empty lots do you see now adays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go carts we had many bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3613/ 8002) 
no < 

Recording: (3614/ 8002) 
umhum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they are doing a very good job about < 

Recording: (3615/ 8002) 
yeah yeah i saw that patiente in the morning 

Recording: (3616/ 8002) 
oh yeah uh 

Recording: (3617/ 8002) 
i know it is connected to like you know england because it is i i guess that is i guess uh i maybe like england owned it once so they 

Recording: (3618/ 8002) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but uh that is interesting uh uh you know when they when the first when the uh when time began you knowa quarter tom my uh what i believe in and everything you know it was man and woman got married you know and and reason they got married ist because of procureation youknow keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i hade no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman but uh if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3619/ 8002) 
i it is not a presidential issue candidat issue as far as i am concerned but uuh i ami 

Recording: (3620/ 8002) 
ong car trips one one f uh of the families is  in uhse oregan n ear the coast uh forget the name of the town not far it is it is along the i think it is along the coast in oregan uh near ugine or something like that and uh the other is in luisiana think alegxandria< which is where my mom is family came from it came from luouisiana yeah my  my background is interesting my mother was born in louisiana and uh my father was born in new rochell new york< as the son of immigrant jewish parents from lithuania < 

Recording: (3621/ 8002) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (3622/ 8002) 
ou are from where 

Recording: (3623/ 8002) 
they they could have taken other i mean well they killed all these people off but they could have you know put them into the background you know had them do a couple of shows this season and then had you know i do not know the adventures of uh uh agent spender and  what is what is their name but then they they killed off all those like supporting former axcess files associated people 

Recording: (3624/ 8002) 
do not know that is where have you been che < 

Recording: (3625/ 8002) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information ovailable to people about bonds and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody got mad at somebody you know you they might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred into some people for no reason 

Recording: (3626/ 8002) 
ell that is right now a lot of it 

Recording: (3627/ 8002)

Recording: (3657/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3658/ 8002) 
well i do not think they should be respons abut i think um kids go to school and they need reoal models good teachers um you know i think schools have gotten a lot abhetter about that it seem lik ind the laghteeighties arly nineties you know the schools lot of them are really bat um i think finally b education department or whatever realizing that parents need help whath their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot uand i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many roral wearers and everty thing try to get good teachers and then you know it is ory is hat to do with money and the am not ymaking enough money whic is the teachers do not make enough money and they are overwork thand all these big large classrooms and it jus seems to me when i kids start dressing in getting in a cleck together you know itoud be hard for them to in are being in say  what is going on ind your life whic s your what st the problen you know that is that is not really should be their rol but um n if they care enough they should call ther parents and  they look wore worried about your son you mniss is a lot school or he tarting ta dress really you know i sometimes and it should not be that dress  has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way  it does involve dress and just you know turning again then nor of the soeciety you know and if they onot ant to be in sports that is fine there is so many different things that they can do in in school and a earn about earts and music and you know but um unfortunatly a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools sof more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can not do un it is some ways it is always kind of ben like that i mean  in wat is like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home you know i mean

if you hae got an eight inch barral on your gun now you tell me where you are gong to put it 

Recording: (3692/ 8002) 
um i am originally from collumbus and uh i am ming a vant corenater for which is a excellent cater anjerman villni um umm forty three years old i have just been married uh three years i have no children uh i have lived in collumbus most of my life although i have i  went to school an at lantaand also lived in orlando florida i used to have a uh intero plandscape business and that is myi  moved to florida four so i am really in arested it ind phorto culture anterid esin bottiny um but when i did move back from columbus i was amazed of all just in a five year span how much ad grown and i think it is a really good city to live in i think it is really progressed well and i enjoy living here 

Recording: (3693/ 8002) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying intention a lot you know like i read the colomist dispatch every day and i read ues news and world report from my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (3694/ 8002)

Recording: (3695/ 8002) 
that would be neat that would be real neat < but that is dream world show 

Recording: (3696/ 8002) 
um i think i am going ta i wenw i really like therizer military because it shows disciplinand  responsibility respect for you go to a columbus public school and the kids will lash out on substitute teachers i think it is really crazy um i think you should have a lot more respect for your elders your adults 

Recording: (3697/ 8002) 
hey have this entrance and they are these trees on the inside of the house they are just growing down into everything and they are like christals and they have this one room that looks like a sfinks and then they have um this backyard that looks all  a cute old england it is really really cool house

yeah 

Recording: (3701/ 8002) 
he admits now that he felt neglected at that period 

Recording: (3702/ 8002) 
and he does have a responsibility but i think there could be a line drawn how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been you know 

Recording: (3703/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3704/ 8002) 
because the mother um he played her because he was with me and you know if and she just was like forget him i do not want him to be around myc c hild and the other one she is older she is they she is like ten and um he says that because his daughter do not call he only she only calls for when she wants things so he does not you know he will whe will get whatever he can for her when she calls but he does not spend time with her 

Recording: (3705/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i it is i it is it is it is a touch i think it is i think it is tough and i think it is really an enovadaral basis but i would not i would say that there is a lot of other things that are that would contribute more to any cietil problems than divorce i really do not think that that would be the main 

Recording: (3706/ 8002) 
oh yeah i have no idea < 

Recording: (3707/ 8002) 
i do not know uh maybe i think i me if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more lkei you  i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know w got i like think about our childis feacher or whatever but really teachers ore paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get gt like more of a respect but ink it is just like tea like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like inoro like especially in out of lessons too like really influence like how you ares a pers ind in like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subjectyo are gon ta hate that subject you know and like if you have good teachers you are gongnao love it i mean theyare relly in influences too like how like what you want to do with your life you know and people do not really acknowlege that too much 

Recording: (3708/ 8002) 
oh uh place on some land with  woods and uh yeah water things like that 

Recording: (3709/ 8002) 
no because honestly like gor to me it is like a best out of a bad bunch like if i have to choose i will choose gor but that does not mean in necessarily like he is most in line with a lot of my stuf with a lot of my views  totto no goat men wong i am not completely liberal on everything like there is certain things i guess maybe because is going to school an to asha them it just rubs off on you there is certain things like i am not so liberal about but i do not really like gor just seems so dry and just not it is hard to i think it wuld be hard to get people enthusiastic for thim 

Recording: (3710/ 8002) 
um kind of uh i mean hir was something i was really into uh until i do not know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which point things sort of switched or you know like do not know like killer robuts or something like transformer and that kind of thing uh in high school i uh i do not now i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys and like star wears is fun i am going to watch star wars more often i had them on tape so i started watchng the an got i i do ot want to say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the painting  i i graduated from high school in nighty four just to put things in a little perspective uh so t like my first couple of years at college  from sort of this i can have  high school ut my first couple of ears of college i just sort of just i do not know i like the story um 

Recording: (3711/ 8002) 
oh i was going to say it would be interesting 

Recording: (3712/ 8002) 
parars i know she was playning on going to uh saint lowis university which i wanted to go to missouri university of missouri but 

Recording: (3713/ 8002)

Recording: (3719/ 8002) 
do 

Recording: (3720/ 8002) 
plays and like like just things that are different and like my sociology and pychology teacher were wre realoo he  he was the same guy taught historya he was real good too like it was really crazy obviously but like it is just like interesting um like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about it you know just 

Recording: (3721/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3722/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3723/ 8002) 
in most in most area in most school districts it is comporable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher in worthington starts i think twenty sixts eight or somethingof course worthington is one of the three highest paid districts in ohio um but used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or starting policeman and you know you are in a sense you are out there risking your life every day too 

Recording: (3724/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (3725/ 8002) 
not really 

Recording: (3726/ 8002) 
well uh when i came uh back from oregon my father was very ill and so i did not want full time work and i started substituting out in uh licking county um and which paid terribly low h there is all these little districts that have a superintendent well know they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a superintendant which they do not need you know so they hire straight out of collegeoe and the there is a law that uh you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years ixperience they had to pay me for so i came back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but but uh i i know that territory i know where i am going < 

Recording: (3727/ 8002)

< u i  to sonn like ga broken record but i really think it is are u bakslide on onfamily un its i think it is too easy thi tay i and i have been married in divorced so i have unfortunately have that experience to me um but it is too easy to get divorced u people do not really go into marriage with commit mhat and lifetime and have that i do not want to say old fasiond vaus but just theya vow you  this is a very important u because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want ta smack him and he is being a littmle barny but i choose to be in love with him because i  made that choice and then not passes i an lon be whold of an hour later week later whar hav whatever long it takes i am in love with him again i mean really you know whan i am saying and um i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying into marriage for the sake of  children but i think if you really make that commitmint and actually work on it you can have a great reallationship you can have kids and bring them up in i m more stable environmet um i unfortunately i think thats the problem parents u ore ay eithey are getting divorced and then they get caught up and the are petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you know using the kid s a medium um or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did no i i do not want to say selfishe but let us face it like we said you know even hav ing a dog takes some time out of your your your schedual and u i not spend enough time with the kids you know they are work en wheting on it and it takes a lot of fort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them iand let them grow and things like that um and i do not think i enough families ey are doing that

and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeah umhumu umhum uhum i know  umhum that is another thing i forgot to mention  umhuxsactly just from family  yeah umhum oh yeah yeah but something i have learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i you know talk too is that you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of uh in your home type of thing and you do not really go around say and yeah we sleep in thi see bed and we brest feed still n < you just kind of f they ask you like yeah well yeah that is just the way we are doing it so 

Recording: (4004/ 8002)

Recording: (4009/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4010/ 8002) 
and it is you know my mom you know she always sad wll what is you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (4011/ 8002) 
yes to but that more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh maybe even today hit is less than that because it is been a because of ta loss of a parent orr inability of a parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes  those things do exist and they wll always have some but that is a very small percentage thaut  is got 

Recording: (4012/ 8002) 
eah that could be ro yeah 

Recording: (4013/ 8002) 
well and do not you think too this like that the more they have found out sychologically speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the uh throws of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the ex that experience from being one of eleven children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (4014/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4015/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4016/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (4017/ 8002) 
oh i have just the same opinion i think most people have as as tv 

Recording: (4018/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4019/ 8002)

whatever his name is arnald iswergeneger he is into his kind of movies i like thi like six cents i love that movie 

Recording: (4021/ 8002)

Recording: (4024/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (4025/ 8002) 
m 

Recording: (4026/ 8002) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (4027/ 8002) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing <to what is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (4028/ 8002) 
for example so you should name her tamera 

Recording: (4029/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (4030/ 8002) 
most e people i associate with ind this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (4031/ 8002) 
hich kids 

Recording: (4032/ 8002) 
i 

Recording: (4033/ 8002) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you would run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids hase the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (4034/ 8002) 
so he did not 

Recording: (4035/ 8002) 
well iha been s i wauls not much i my being here and my daughter being there i did not really have the uh time with her than i wished i would have had you know but uh uh her mother  you know ded they are all right ind everything but i wished i would have been inmore involved in her growing up annd i think two people families are generall but are you know for not necessarilly living be you know h being married ind everything but 

Recording: (4036/ 8002) 
basically because he plans which the utilities had for our location they could not provide to us because of the uh the vester ruling so we had to go out and um uh do our own seurveys become s educated through uh courses uh through att and through pardu university it was and i think oh you had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major intellicommunication group but um the projects basically we were going from a um putting  the other a network itself and we had  you think of a piline system or the used  called dasa chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to a data network and uh we got down to the point where we went to a spoake network where everyone had dedicated pipe 

Recording: (4037/ 8002) 
i am from columbus ohiowa was born and raised in columbus i i grew up on the east side of columbus i graduated from high school i then started working for ohio state in nineteen seventy seven and have been there here for twenty four years 

Recording: (4038/ 8002)

Recording: (4039/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (4046/ 8002) 
that is great 

Recording: (4047/ 8002) 
yeah yeah  and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it < but if you aregoing na play it at me you know six times in three hours < 

Recording: (4048/ 8002) 
i heard something the other day that really really upset me i was at um this convention downtown  the convention center and uh one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops as a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear you are writing to a person who is in the eighth grade 

Recording: (4049/ 8002) 
i think my grandpall goes to church 

Recording: (4050/ 8002) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month ertiod so i am i am working fora research firm just for the convenience of the hours i i want i got back in tof a nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because i would be at least an eight hoursifht and uh i do not think that we are ready for that  he is a teacher umhum he works at high school yeaw he teaches nineth and tenth graders no <i do not think that at all i would be deceeving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about them i am just like i am like os i can not believe allo thof the the things that these kids are experiencing i did nontt know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about that when i was that age and it is kind of scary 

Recording: (4051/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4052/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (4053/ 8002) 
yeah < 

Recording: (4054/ 8002) 
yes i do uh bu i try to visit at least uh at least two every two years we either we go to new york or we meet halfway coupleo years ago we met at pinstate and uh so you know the older ones  are all dying off though so 

Recording: (4055/ 8002) 
yeah so yeah and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (4056/ 8002) 
oh it is just so vethe environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships amnd uh you know i think it is a f much frendlier place and thend i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just do not have proverty well if anybody is in proverty in oregan it is because they have chosen to live a symple life it is not ah you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregn is not that great but you know they say in ugine that even the disworsiers have p achd the < well the the uh the level of the years of education por capitis probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (4057/ 8002) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (4058/ 8002) 
not there other important roles where would those nouns be where would your mother possiably ben  she went to cathlic school i take it where would she had been if it went for the nuns why weu put nuns down hey they worked lot less than your mother  is event gettin compencated for and they had a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (4059/ 8002) 
but i mean like if test schores are identical and the have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (4060/ 8002) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is a pretty decent person i mean i do not think ha there is anything violent or thery are just anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and makes som big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that is sort of what people wl pick up their perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helphing people out or things like that when the local high schools like volunteering at like the local senior citizenis home or something like that 

Recording: (4061/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4062/ 8002) 
yeah and it just did not work 

Recording: (4063/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4064/ 8002) 
and he travels all over the state of ohio youa know 

Recording: (4065/ 8002)

Recording: (4067/ 8002) 
h 

Recording: (4068/ 8002)

Recording: (4069/ 8002) 
and so they offered to move them back 

Recording: (4070/ 8002) 
oh yes 

Recording: (4071/ 8002) 
and unfortunattyely uh they did not really prove anything except for that they that death is final 

Recording: (4072/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4073/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4074/ 8002)

Recording: (4076/ 8002) 
yeah he wants to teach he is he likes football and he wants the coach football but you have to teach to do that so 

Recording: (4077/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4078/ 8002) 
oh my gosh it was  it was it was just unbelievable he got really sick after that rush week yeah really sick so they want in to move in the fraternity house he can not really afford it but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he is like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so i am thinking they might help him out a little bit they want him in the house real bad 

Recording: (4079/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4080/ 8002) 
basically uh it is just the talk and stuff it is not uh like you know what i mean uh i am black i am better or i am white i am better it is it is none of that 

Recording: (4081/ 8002) 
um  it is an eago trip that is all it is basically it is like look i can do this 

Recording: (4082/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4083/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (4084/ 8002) 
it is just 

Recording: (4085/ 8002) 
nop umum 

Recording: (4086/ 8002) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was he and when he is fourteen or sixteen and he really wants  to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finished school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money and i mean we do not need to havea tun but we just should be at least a little out of debt o yeah  something 

Recording: (4087/ 8002) 
ne of the main thing is they never leave they do not they go lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest gpa of any college 

Recording: (4088/ 8002) 
they 

Recording: (4089/ 8002) 
a parake yes a little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (4090/ 8002) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress progression that needs to be made uh i was just talking this so whene a couple o weeks ago whois uh fhellw history major and her and actually her brother is a fellow fellow history majo are two and a friend of min i do not know them all that whell but uh parently her family i mean she is she is double major history in chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports here in this but they have made it painfully clear that when that she should not plan on having a career because it she is going to have to raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my beliefh an and in the fact that it is like the mals telling the daughter lik thi is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think an i indal individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that is sort of going i am hoping at is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scary or bhack in liked ninety four in ninety five but uh i think we have reached a point where becaus not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is chriticizing the advance 

Recording: (4091/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (4092/ 8002) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (4093/ 8002) 
ye the big things 

Recording: (4094/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4095/ 8002) 
but when he did have something to do with them it was kind of strange they would go out and whissle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (4096/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4097/ 8002) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we can na we knew a lot of stuff we were going to we raised him to be very independent and i always said that weare going ao regret this someday i said another ten years we wiull be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent uh so i gess t the point that when we were first married pretty it was hard to make a de simple decision on anything you know if we have worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own orn anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independent we sit was sad stubbern but it is like even go to macdonald is or something and he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a uh happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even ais six and seven years old and tell him 

Recording: (4098/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4099/ 8002) 
so if you if ou you  you could not bring any any like pets but i will say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the state so you have to leave all those 

Recording: (4100/ 8002) 
and thi if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebell 

Recording: (4101/ 8002) 
yeah the meia exposure < 

Recording: (4102/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4103/ 8002) 
yeah i i want to  as phone do it < 

Recording: (4104/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4105/ 8002) 
ilike you are doing interviews 

Recording: (4106/ 8002) 
on the spir of the moment i woud to have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (4107/ 8002) 
oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months and uh and uh i went to the produice stand and i took my umbrella and of course it does not rain too much  cornia and i said oh i am from oregon and i always think it is going to rain and he says well i am from washington and i know it is goin to rain < 

Recording: (4108/ 8002) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionar with all the law suits of different yeah experience with um sexual harassment 

Recording: (4109/ 8002) 
so ife you want to get to met two mere men is a pla okay now you got another leage but the thing let me ask you question how does that impact you if you can not be a priest are not there other important quote unquote rolles for women in the church are not there other important roalles 

Recording: (4110/ 8002) 
i< 

Recording: (4111/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4112/ 8002) 
it is like hitting me and i justam not sure you can tell me if it is not anywhere near my mouth 

Recording: (4113/ 8002)

Recording: (4114/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4115/ 8002)

Recording: (4118/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (4119/ 8002) 
i think i would say the same thing because um course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness and um 

Recording: (4120/ 8002) 
why is that 

Recording: (4121/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (4122/ 8002)

yeah course you know babies tend not to be on on tides 

Recording: (4130/ 8002)

Recording: (4131/ 8002) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like  black as and all this you know they are prejudiced and all she is doing is yelling about being  their prjudence against her because   what she do not understand at is her dam job 

Recording: (4132/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4133/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (4134/ 8002)

Recording: (4153/ 8002) 
two years 

Recording: (4154/ 8002) 
hat is good 

Recording: (4155/ 8002)

Recording: (4156/ 8002) 
hum 

Recording: (4157/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4158/ 8002)

they nt heard it all before and they some of them had known me for a few years but uh my wife is told after i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else and i i do not believe th< yeah humhum 

Recording: (4165/ 8002) 
i at this point i blame it on the administration um and the citizens of columbus have not i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a leviy you should never defeat a school leviy 

Recording: (4166/ 8002) 
ou know they  just kick him to the hallway he was either you know in the hallway or in uh the office and and the nouns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivial questions 

Recording: (4167/ 8002)

Recording: (4176/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4177/ 8002) 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else

i think when you have two or more pets you have to make a lttle bit more effort 

Recording: (4179/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (4180/ 8002) 
yeah it was pretty much upper middle class 

Recording: (4181/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4182/ 8002) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but there is some for public too 

Recording: (4183/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4184/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (4185/ 8002)

Recording: (4187/ 8002) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of a u how much do you have to have of the senat to pass a law you know it could be something real real technical or something that a three year old coauld ancwer because it is trying to hit you know all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (4188/ 8002) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (4189/ 8002) 
well somehow or other yeah  and if they if everybody would just begin to beel t that way and when they started to say something nasty i would think would i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (4190/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4191/ 8002) 
i hope not some of these mongars that go as around and always predicts the worst things like everybody is saying  the ingd that you know two thousand happens do not go out and selebrate new year  ther the year old  world is got ta eend well how is yit go to the end you know an 

Recording: (4192/ 8002) 
that was a lot of old thinking 

Recording: (4193/ 8002) 
no offense thit is easir an a trying to call up 

Recording: (4194/ 8002) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (4195/ 8002) 
i have seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murdere that murder it is like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (4196/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4197/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4198/ 8002) 
< well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just wanto shoot somebody unfortunately anybody says that i i mean i am i do not even like stepping on ants but there is those moments where you are like 

Recording: (4199/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (4200/ 8002) 
umhum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (4201/ 8002) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i am thinking i may get into that 

Recording: (4202/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (4203/ 8002) 
does hem 

Recording: (4204/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (4205/ 8002) 
uhum 

Recording: (4206/ 8002) 
umhum ookay 

Recording: (4207/ 8002) 
well i do not know if fit is manro county or 

Recording: (4208/ 8002) 
it is just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for y i mean they just obviouslythey are gonto be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (4209/ 8002) 
ido not know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (4210/ 8002) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that wellit is my choic oh god my husband is a lot better af these type of questions because he was methodist and he  chows to drink cathlik when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the cathlic religion and the more i was exposed to his itis like boy thes really are similar put yours is a lot looser than mine andyou know < was you k um just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about suks and drugs and being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the childrenumhum 

Recording: (4211/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4212/ 8002) 
oh yeah i think everybody should hafe nothing else you mised her boat by at that time 

Recording: (4213/ 8002)

ell that is good that is good 

Recording: (4217/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4218/ 8002) 
um so i think that part definitely helps where as most of my other friends you know thety are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um where like i said i have already done all the stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (4219/ 8002)

Recording: (4267/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4268/ 8002) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only hafe to be able to dis use like you said it wal likea the necessities 

Recording: (4269/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4270/ 8002)

okay 

Recording: (4275/ 8002) 
yeah i hope we are going to get there < 

Recording: (4276/ 8002) 
i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones they grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i meanand more like more of the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone  under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it would cause any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (4277/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (4278/ 8002) 
right < 

Recording: (4279/ 8002)

Recording: (4283/ 8002) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any diffrenof you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefit it a lot from it now 

Recording: (4284/ 8002)

Recording: (4288/ 8002) 
family experiences 

Recording: (4289/ 8002)

Recording: (4302/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4303/ 8002) 
and that the the the people who who most face that liy are the supposed benefitiaries of civil reds legislation um so  i mean civil rights was an an important step but once that step was made it was stoped and now i believe today there are are uh i mean  i see a a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and it is not our generation who is curtailing it it is still the uh like our parentis generation u 

Recording: (4304/ 8002)

Recording: (4307/ 8002) 
uh she is real good yeah yeah everything is healthy and great um she and then my daughter i mean i think she is jejust going to be a real good influence she is a single mom and um the father is in another relationship and probably on his way to be getting married and you know so it does not look like he is going to be in the picture that much and she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him to be too so becouse you 

Recording: (4308/ 8002)

um freshman  sofhmore year yes after that i quit restling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a click you try to be part of the team and the team tris to do everything the same 

Recording: (4353/ 8002) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it is i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer uh and you know i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is and i i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily uh i i i do not know it is a tough an and i you i mean your daughter it i it daughter s you knw it is still young so you havd to deal with it but it is scary it send your kids ti school and you hear these things and it is just no matter where it is in the country yor world you hear of it you knowi really worries you 

Recording: (4354/ 8002) 
you should be real attentive to what is happening in his school situation his or her 

Recording: (4355/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4356/ 8002) 
so she is and hopefully they will get married soe they have been together for over a year and a half 

Recording: (4357/ 8002) 
you know why 

Recording: (4358/ 8002) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (4359/ 8002) 
and neither one of these folks could answer yes or no and they are going just answer yes or no that is like wall i think i staytid my point very clearly when i a the answere is yes or was it was it was um health care for live ing partners um it is a simple question yes or know how do you stand on this issue and it just guys mea nos that you know and i know that that from a pir standpoint you do not want to you know wan to shun any people a way that might vote for you because you feel like the they meant you know if you are running for office you should just just be upfront 

Recording: (4360/ 8002) 
well right now i think he knows enough i am just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i am pretty i am like wow i can not even build the stuff that he bild he makes ships and cars and rockkets and < 

Recording: (4361/ 8002) 
right < 

Recording: (4362/ 8002) 
just i think it is uhare to reflect the the um beliefs that we are trying to  carry and and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i are not saying that it is terrible that but if they had like a knose ring and all the stuff then i somebody might not believe that they have anything credible to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more respectfully that to you know i mean most the people will accept you if you are dressed and ad dress where as i mean even in a person in a nose rangle will respect you but but then you are in a you are out a disadvantage if you do not < dress in a certain way 

Recording: (4363/ 8002) 
they they definitely struggle they they do i o i think to be that high up obviously you are going t come in contact with powerful people ritch people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the republicans so like i said best out of a bad bunc i would probably 

Recording: (4364/ 8002) 
umum 

Recording: (4365/ 8002) 
way background 

Recording: (4366/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4367/ 8002) 
i think that the 

Recording: (4368/ 8002) 
the catholic schools

right right 

Recording: (4372/ 8002) 
too much 

Recording: (4373/ 8002) 
but i am using miloans example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me rong 

Recording: (4374/ 8002) 
oh letis you 

Recording: (4375/ 8002) 
and i looked at it and i thought   introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broaugder than that so i ended up coming up with a class that was it was a only nine weeks too it was only nine classes um so t was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks and uh i ended up coming up with a curiculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly and uh visual art and for the second three weeks we talked about music and uh uh development of musick verious aspects and for the last three weeks we talked about theater actually for the two of the last three weeks we talked about theater and for the last week we talked about musical theater and an opera  so for a lot of these kids you know fromit was an introduction to uh it was an introduction to a lot of things that they maight might not have been exposed to < ah 

Recording: (4376/ 8002) 
uh outer in is over i do not even know le 

Recording: (4377/ 8002) 
just carring around a gun and shooting someone

Recording: (4387/ 8002) 
i should have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for moey or previously do net work for money or something obnoxious and stupid like ay franchise for money i am in favor of that i  come up with a good system by which to do things they sell it to you you go do those things i sit taround and make money off of your efforts yea that so 

Recording: (4388/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4389/ 8002)

Recording: (4390/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (4391/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4392/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4393/ 8002)

Recording: (4398/ 8002) 
yeah i was trying to avoid that question  r no but uh i thought you know just get a little insighte on what is going on out there in delaware and you know maybe possibly find someone to be with but 

Recording: (4399/ 8002)

Recording: (4404/ 8002) 
umum< 

Recording: (4405/ 8002) 
hougt that valuable but they that is what they thought though you get it for fr well you and then you you prove up on it tas they say you youus build buildings a house and boron and and uh so that you can live on it and uh i think i do not know i suppose farm a certain amount of it i mean put in wheet or whatever and uh then after five years you  get a title to it it oers so they thought well gee you know free coma free land to a farmer so uh they went out there but i they an sent ineleven years that they were out there they only raised shree or four crops 

Recording: (4406/ 8002) 
oh did you really 

Recording: (4407/ 8002) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do ind through school and through education that is their avenue to go there 

Recording: (4408/ 8002)

that is an embarrasment for a college this size 

Recording: (4466/ 8002) 
i know that is why you have to get it recorded  i it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they are on a shoe string they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count in cind contribution the west uh auterbin college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and uh the salary the conductor uh so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have student college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh bu once in a whilewe will get wind players h play in it also and uh sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something  you wanted to play < 

Recording: (4467/ 8002)

Recording: (4572/ 8002) 
some of the really hard questions um why o bad things happen thar good people people can not people can not just accept that that bad things happen to good people they want to know why  i do not know why i am not i i mean yeah i have a person ove relationship with my with my god but we are not on you know we are not on a conversation now i am on this side of the table you are on that is tof th table why did this happen you nw he is not he does not see fit to tell me whyi somephing happens unless it pertains to me um lese what is another really hard one um one of the biggest ones with people my age is the the is um appologetics uh for appologetics which is going out and saying youour center except chrise everybody on this campus his heard of brother jead he runs around on can he runs arond on the ovel going you know slit for you ot he haut the at of and that is just i mean they are a lot of they are a lot of people with hin the community of of christians who can not stand that we do not like what he is doing because yeah i am one of them because we have ho go back anyone who has been influnced my himd we have to go back and we have to undo all the damage he is done before we can really start in on them and nd and helping them to understand what we are trying to tell them we have to undo what brother jad his done because he is just i mean yeah i may be hit is hearts in the right place but he is doing it the wrong way but um one of the big things is right after you are done s doing all of the shpeel about you know why you thingk they should  accept christ in their life they say okay that is good for you and that is the general that is thae general feeling among people ar age our generation i mean whate generation f art ly anyways i am i am in tn i am twenty so there is like the generationo ex they are the generation right after mend then there is a generation why two kay they ar generation righ before me so we are sturk rigt in the middle d not even think we have a generation

Recording: (4581/ 8002) 
yeah i do not know why uh congress was just stubbern about it until the last year uh they had not been able to get sub fifty per substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were split and the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well i do not know if the parents made any thien about it but i guess finally you know when you have fifty percent of your classrooms uncovered uh they came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids tha princible or the other teachers but now it is like well thank you for coming oh thank you for coming so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who were not messling around with it have come back in so i do not know exactly what yeah <

Recording: (4818/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4819/ 8002)

Recording: (4820/ 8002) 
well see that is not proved out by the the approvial ratings he is till had is higher approvle rating than reagan had in his last eightteen months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that um that you know people do not liht all the crap that went with him is thepune ents on tv you know they say that and they re hey re still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elisabut dol they woul nt have been able to attack on the issues so they ould find other things to get get her rone so they  start bring out all the ise women and all that stuff on and most people did not care about it they did no care about it before the election they did no care about it during his campaying they did no care about it during his presidency it was some republic can raght wing i do not know what who were just trying to make an issue out ofe nothing it was not watergate you know he may have been a cat you kno he may have you n but she was twenty one itis not like it was someone who could  make up her own mind what she wanted to do you knw an he may have been stupid and a cat and but i di no wan to know about it on day one when it hit the the news i did not want to know about it and on the end when he was you know not impeached i did not want n know about it and in between i did not want to know about it and they just kept angering mey because there ware other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen and not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse off of where america is on such issues as gun control and women is rights and and things that are important to people you know th they have tried to make sudo issues out of clinton and then they tryd to make a sudo issue out of you know giving a tax cut people do not want a tax cut when it is going to effect their social security or effect you know uh the the the deficit 

Recording: (4821/ 8002)

Recording: (5081/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5082/ 8002) 
so you know downstairs there is five different sectors so they split the uh area up into five different areas and uh you know there are some sectors down there that get extremely busy and then sometimes it is just like you kow you are twidling your thums it is it is like feaster famin you know it is not like steady like if you are working at mir running the casheregister it is just kind of like study it is like you look at you know you just it would be like sitting at mir and there is no one in your line and then you turn your back and turn back around and there is like seventy five people 

Recording: (5083/ 8002) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like he design om maybe a designer but you know like i went to uh i i was in police  uh law enforcement 

Recording: (5084/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (5085/ 8002) 
it was like u give them a license to be a screw up you know uh a lot of the nurses even who were former attics you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they were not doing fallowing protocall and of course me i would be the ones saying hey you are not falling protocall and they would say well you know i am i am a former attic i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (5086/ 8002) 
it is just challenge to figure out how to make something work or how to i i am justt incredibly optimistic i mean i really feel like um whatever happens to me i really it is it is my responsibility to you know help int happen take care of it deal with it you know i am i always have a back up plan 

Recording: (5087/ 8002) 
because i would have got my as whipped 

Recording: (5088/ 8002) 
hum i went to private schools for a long time 

Recording: (5089/ 8002) 
right and just going over it and over it and over it 

Recording: (5090/ 8002) 
it is a lot of money 

Recording: (5091/ 8002) 
yeah he is teaching us uh system five uhit is just funny 

Recording: (5092/ 8002) 
but here it is just to see you know how much success you can have and then they just want to leave but we we can look forward to the baskeball season i think he is a good coach 

Recording: (5093/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5094/ 8002) 
but uh the the first lutenant who was our uh in command of the bettery at that time says well let is get the loud o heare 

Recording: (5095/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5096/ 8002) 
um well the opinion kind of like the general concens is around upper arlington is that osu is not a good enough school 

Recording: (5097/ 8002) 
so this is my first on am like ony doge< so 

Recording: (5098/ 8002) 
what n bark 

Recording: (5099/ 8002) 
h so there is there is no faulting that i meet for these folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative and responsed to say to this experience so you end up with you re kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately following ion never mind pretend i never said that 

Recording: (5100/ 8002) 
yeah they gave us nine dollars a day it wis like nine twenty five for what meal plant i was on so then um we bought like pop tarts and that lasted r like a week of brekfastand 

Recording: (5101/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (5102/ 8002) 
and the people that would be decent parent are not because of the situations and what not um just my nobody  my my sister does not have kids i do not have kids wheare in our midthe late thirties um our friends just had one um i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they are just great parents id not know those kids are going to be going in but then i have uh other people that like my other friends it just had one we are trying to help a a child and children is services that came from or 

Recording: (5103/ 8002) 
stop yeah those are real chemicals 

Recording: (5104/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5105/ 8002) 
that is gool 

Recording: (5106/ 8002) 
hum i  joned up in ohio 

Recording: (5107/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (5108/ 8002) 
like management here 

Recording: (5109/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5110/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5111/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (5112/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (5113/ 8002) 
um neither one of them is married or has kids uh my sister does has a boy friend for probably like three years or so and theiris talked about them like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (5114/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5115/ 8002) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (5116/ 8002) 
yeah actually have bunch of numbers here that i hope i did not lose yeah i got uh three people to call see about jobs therre should be in within middle of the week yeah because gas money iss i can do construction cooking actually took colummus public school is cooking test and passd it so i am < technically a cook 

Recording: (5117/ 8002) 
sor they are close but i try to avvoid seeing them except my grandfather who is ah a nice terrible human being the others are all nice and sweet and stuff but  do not hav enough arwording characteristics to make they wn to spend lots of time around them 

Recording: (5118/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5119/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5120/ 8002) 
yeah i think it is further east than where i was i was right in the yeurol mountains so it is like the border of europe and asia 

Recording: (5121/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5122/ 8002) 
mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high type tape recorder not a big realdo real thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh like rere if congress has it i will jus dtri about to washington or have them send it here you know um that i think is a major contribution of the past generation uh 

Recording: (5123/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5124/ 8002) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well bhat you know thos i mean  it seems you know from what i have read if you wanted to make a bom it is fairly u uncomplicated you know so that is 

Recording: (5125/ 8002) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but < they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (5126/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5127/ 8002) 
yeah it doesn it is not like a skilled profession to me think 

Recording: (5128/ 8002) 
that is right in other words it is so much me any more instead of us hand we 

Recording: (5129/ 8002) 
t i see that i because i do not think americans travel as much as as like the the europeans do i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they get the change that they eurol change than the buses and and and and just like the first but just by personal car you can go you know occross just going across the border yo hiy can they can go visit uh you know countries like like it is so condense but heare it is like we got ar ocians and it is like we got if like fli so so i i think that is why i like i think a europeans aare more a are much more cooler in that respect they they are much more cosmopolitan just because i they they they it is like it is no big deal fort for like somebody in yeurope to speak like suven languagees wt here it is like you know who get somebody over here  you wa who can actually who actually knows english < you know it is like so that that is i think that is i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5130/ 8002) 
and i would definitely keep a ey out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (5131/ 8002)

and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything

because it is more open u and you couch it in terms of civil rights um my boy friends thinks hit is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based and that i you can kno more change your sexual orientation and you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different um whatever those ei pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that is just cosmetic and anyone who tris to change your sexual orientation that is cosmetic too um and again my belief is whatever happens between can cending adults is their business not mine um e i do not know that anyone could change it a what was your question again

< 

Recording: (5215/ 8002) 
there did not used to ben especially in restaurants and everything and now it is such a open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um body is taste you know i mean before know i would have to go into a restaurant into saland baked potato you know i mean there is nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffe and then all the food so cooked down i mean honestly you know it is like no nutritional value

uh we have been very happy with the ose day care i do not know if you have any association whith it but oh it is it is just unbelievable our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade and uh i mean when she got out of that day care she could read she could writ she could do computer you know you know it is an education it is not you know people you pay for it it is one of your hires but you know higher amount of money for 

Recording: (5220/ 8002) 
so you have how many kids i 

Recording: (5221/ 8002) 
tis true home 

Recording: (5222/ 8002) 
it felt innocent to me and i liked that um because all the other times where they have started to kis it is always been like sterio typic romantic thad i  di o and then it is like wow two friends alone it is new yearis perfect you know it was not it was not like they were going to jump in the sack or anything like that 

Recording: (5223/ 8002) 
< really i do not know i mean i guess for me i i just i just thin jacon and i get along so wow you know and and we have been together for about two years and i mean i i do not know i just i do i just i just really like her but i do not kno feel thain ten years from now but it certainly there is a lot of things that that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about diefferent things and and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things ye  have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in our relationship for about five years before i met him and um his name was jason two but he he drank a lot 

Recording: (5224/ 8002) 
um i would tend to say mostt people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there is no more cinister groups than the other that i know 

Recording: (5225/ 8002) 
yeah i think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things uf having too many people in one area um i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you knowi am more aware of what is going on and i really uh i am going no be some kind of activist for  um i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things like that i j i think that is going to be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there is one off of uh bethel or know it is of of henders and cahoots and then there is the red hot peppers or something i i saw the other day and i caunot even believe they are like rit across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so i think it  really affects it yeah try to go around << and until they make a woman is club so will not be real equal< 

Recording: (5226/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5227/ 8002) 
a lot of people have switched from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (5228/ 8002) 
but they are uh because they are both government programs but yeah but i think like i said for the for the younger people because it is because it is not their fault their parents can not get health health care so < 

Recording: (5229/ 8002) 
eventually 

Recording: (5230/ 8002)

Recording: (5231/ 8002) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room ith the library is connected to and it was all main frame and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world if who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out into the public wook cand the public see and do it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the w you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with librarye is before now we are trying to igure out how do we deal with anybody who just can t wants to connect to us

Recording: (5275/ 8002) 
okay so they it seems like an independent contractor for them 

Recording: (5276/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5277/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5278/ 8002)

Recording: (5286/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (5287/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5288/ 8002) 
mean it goes back more towards tha curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5289/ 8002) 
crime and stuff uh i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that me have started during the republic an years and care it over uh but people have been better off financially overall uh and i and i do not think he is made any i i would not say he is made ans manyj mistakes policy ways well yeah his personal life  just he is he is well yeah< 

Recording: (5290/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (5291/ 8002) 
no that is 

Recording: (5292/ 8002) 
hum 

Recording: (5293/ 8002) 
back then i was working at a cycle shop but i was in the service bute i was working there 

Recording: (5294/ 8002) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5295/ 8002) 
yeah oh my uh i am in this uh venturing cruwe which is through boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (5296/ 8002)

Recording: (5302/ 8002) 
uh it is just there we go again who is right ad who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (5303/ 8002) 
t i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (5304/ 8002) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school < because there were pregnant girls in my high school 

Recording: (5305/ 8002) 
do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (5306/ 8002) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (5307/ 8002) 
and i think that sometimes they do not even count all the votes or something and sometimes that they really want et tey gog through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen as somehow or outher her they all count it so it did or they will you know ow that i 

Recording: (5308/ 8002) 
the part now it takes about fifty minutes but to do all thi stretching 

Recording: (5309/ 8002) 
right right 

Recording: (5310/ 8002) 
i do not intend to ever leave here so < 

Recording: (5311/ 8002)

Recording: (5313/ 8002) 
how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry the these things out i think it is it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (5314/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5315/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (5316/ 8002) 
but i imagine your sibaling has a a similar world view perhaps twisted in some 

Recording: (5317/ 8002) 
do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it is like six and seven hours a day at the computer and i just do not want to do it

you know she is work ina in a school building and  she hears all the troubles and < 

Recording: (5352/ 8002) 
yeah yeah and that is the thing about the schools too you know i and totally disagree with uniforms you know unless it is all slaks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms and their shorte and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said heay you know her this is you know have not met me and i and i really you know faulht myself for that but it is made me more aware too and i you know when you look at so man es oh you would never dream that they well i do you know they are thot anything and i do not put pas anybody doing e really do not because they just yeah oh   no i do because there is some good ones out there and there is some bad ones too but you know 

Recording: (5353/ 8002) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (5354/ 8002) 
but i mean i honestly do think i would at least go to church on occasion if it was not forced on me i mean it just got sort of just to the point of being ridiculous goingin seventeen eighteen years every single week

oh 

Recording: (5356/ 8002) 
um three years 

Recording: (5357/ 8002) 
oh wow 

Recording: (5358/ 8002) 
you can get in huge arguments people like no you are lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them dead and honnestly i can honestly say i would not want that tho happen to them

Recording: (5452/ 8002) 
of the times and memories and stuff

Recording: (5463/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (5464/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5465/ 8002) 
so m like 

Recording: (5466/ 8002) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with hit for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (5467/ 8002) 
like  oh from mormans well our basic um real fundamental belief is that tha church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and tha it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve appossals and but after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to u have those apossals and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same cathlic and or all the orthodox church still carried all these beliefes

Recording: (5480/ 8002) 
yeah when i first went to oberland i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i would maybe thought major ind music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more to mention in terms of my miy teaching possibilities and uh although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science uh it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5481/ 8002) 
gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (5482/ 8002)

Recording: (5488/ 8002) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy 

Recording: (5489/ 8002)

Recording: (5490/ 8002) 
no thit is real like to live off campus youu have to well after my class it will be twenty two and senior chredit status but my class was twenty one or senior or senior credit so i got to move off campus but like had i been a year younger i would not have been able to because i have to wait until twenty two so the 

Recording: (5491/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5492/ 8002) 
names i uh actually read a story and some book about this black lady that was having like her nintheno tenh kid and she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she like so they brought her um lunch in to her and he nurse jokingly said or the aid or something well just picked a couple of names off the menue so she named them lamangello and orrangello lemongello orange gellow she picked lemon gello orange gellow and turned them into la mangello and orrangelo  denise and danephew < 

Recording: (5493/ 8002) 
i do not argue with them i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (5494/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5495/ 8002) 
and uh well shei thehthe people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first department community uh in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (5496/ 8002) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about thns my oldest sister you know i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5497/ 8002) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to the day care and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (5498/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (5499/ 8002) 
< right yeah 

Recording: (5500/ 8002) 
person i she is pretty high up i guess i was u unaware 

Recording: (5501/ 8002) 
i answered it ri << 

Recording: (5502/ 8002) 
oa o no no foras te coe ur ur fras re o 

Recording: (5503/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5504/ 8002) 
but i managed to get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and christ crismas interpretition of the story at this point iis one moment i am chearfully playing on the computer and the next moment ent i i turnd around there is a large police officer in the door wa of your room he said hi < he said i think you should come down stairs  do not dow ol kis anything so christ comes down stairs and he stands beside me 

Recording: (5505/ 8002) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is an insanity but in my opinioin there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is an insane and uh just to to nock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them uh mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and um < uh so i have got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the  uh uh reincarnation the law cos an effect and if a person murder somebody they nee they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their uh their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that harden chriminals real hard criminals will not aver admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to

Recording: (5538/ 8002) 
rightthe same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older polks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outsideof the house they get home they are aggravated they are ups et somebody else thy had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situation is got that way but i do pleve that the older people including our government people and everybody at is the the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (5539/ 8002) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5540/ 8002)

Recording: (5542/ 8002) 
which was scheduled in the evenings when i was working and i could not even go to theroapy 

Recording: (5543/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5544/ 8002) 
as he was speaking and and as he s tarted tos speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous inmpression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are s because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries ind us are just like all one country any more or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (5545/ 8002) 
ecause you know the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and leather games and you know at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer as all education stuff it is not game game it it has a game theam to it but 

Recording: (5546/ 8002) 
it it was not easy in at first it was probably a lot harder than after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to am coming back here it was 

Recording: (5547/ 8002) 
oh uhhuh 

Recording: (5548/ 8002) 
now that was up the age a tanto are they are about to i think that the you sait to get back to the very beginning of the birr than up throug kinnig arents or for wat i that i that is the family but  i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values of but but be good values i do not o n whether  ther old er new but good valuese and i think we really need to have that ar thabege within our educational system uh starting in the elementaryan right on up through college i think they are ought to be a number of colleg ar curses uh that that de voted exclusively for this so that those students cing go back and buh uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements withhin them that are teaching value family values uh i could even so go so far as ti say an chemistry or bottainy or scychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but  i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value of family value uh and it will help then permiate the entire society and but it is got to start back here ind the pirstand i think 

Recording: (5549/ 8002) 
i think that uh  it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5550/ 8002) 
at our desk we had terminals that connected to a sysstem 

Recording: (5551/ 8002) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5552/ 8002) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again a it is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bar tender responsible but sa you could come up i give you a bear and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5553/ 8002) 
 

Recording: (5554/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5555/ 8002) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service a guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a buracracy 

Recording: (5556/ 8002) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5557/ 8002) 
t dos not matter how much money they are given for their education they 

Recording: (5558/ 8002) 
well number one it is a little bit smaller more controled area quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to ha sister you know my sister lives up here she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having all the peace peace and quiet she wants you know plus in a place that is only year old

Recording: (5561/ 8002) 
they go she is got it and they ar gong to the next guy and then all of a sud den you are going aoff this wone they go uh that is nice juliat uh where are you going and you are like uh oh you told me to and then they go oh berother you know so now you know t attention is diverted to you so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are therere real professional yeah u 

Recording: (5562/ 8002) 
according to that and so i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5563/ 8002) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on okay i i just have a question is do you is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5564/ 8002) 
my boy friend would love to mess with this i just wante you to knowha he would be liking he taken it apart pitting hi back together 

Recording: (5565/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (5566/ 8002) 
like i said i have been here twenty five years i have seen a lot of weird stuff the fact is when i was a bigger i hav seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 

Recording: (5567/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5568/ 8002) 
i mean instead of a doctor

Recording: (5575/ 8002) 
yeah she is got she is got a lot of kids < there is um three boys and like four girls 

Recording: (5576/ 8002) 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh the i i have not went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that bige thing except for the influx of the you know i dveot realize how many were being drafted ore being nlisting to the service at the time and everything or how many actually we are even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (5577/ 8002) 
o 

Recording: (5578/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (5579/ 8002) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening and a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like councel council states um you know this sort of sterio type you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have loads of boy friends and girl friends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted onthing to love or you know we were bord so we decided to have sex and i mean i h find et just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed wish sayng oh you know hel you knw slept with like t ten girls or something i am thinking oh my god sho know ind these thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but an my opiniond the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kidty even if they are not of workeu knage they get like a and a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby theire provide theire the top of the list for a counsiel house so they get theire own there was actually a long dactument her ond before i left um you know of this girl who as constantly fighting with her parents and you knw r parents we re at the end of their op she got pregnand and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to me av out because she gets heir own place she gets money for herself money for baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know what more could she want you know was basically what she was saying i have got my owmplace i can do what ever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so  that i think is a very bad si shuation because they are almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5580/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5581/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5582/ 8002)

so they built one out an hilliard su 

Recording: (5585/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (5586/ 8002) 
yeah well people is people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that to me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along trying to < take it up space no 

Recording: (5587/ 8002) 
n i think it is pass yeare they had two murders over there and uh it was publicized in th clumbus area but uh it is s

yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (5594/ 8002) 
and i mean yeah  they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact wofe matter is it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (5595/ 8002) 
thing at first but she my she loves my kids and she loves my husband 

Recording: (5596/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5597/ 8002) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were going to buy a house ting clenten vill to hold them and rent them my probem is i do not have any money so i tha thoun payment  has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple of condase over on bethel road for my kids toll live in soh my oldest girl when she was going ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your landlady and then  w it will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was going to move out when she graduate from high school and changed your mind so i ou just run that one but it the botam line is i i just got a  i could mortgage and i have a guy that i worked with that helpe me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would you would be find you would be running you would not buy anything that you did nothink you could rent and come out even with

Recording: (5629/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5630/ 8002) 
yeah i kno i you know i think too i palligise to my oldest daughter amast every day about four thing all i put her through whan we were trying to grow up the gather and i was twenty four when she was born an so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectattions of what what children are capable ver what they can do because if they are really verbleand my kids always have been really verabl because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even what you know when they could not talke to me that was irrellevant i was talking to them the whole ti iwhayso we e see i do not chutup so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really forble and soy would seem like theyw had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five wee got a hamsterou kno i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it did id a i was so surprised that she had not given then ben giveng im food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you kno not you they do not get that stuff together or when she was aleven we s old her bedrom furnater and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buyd something else was with in three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a hav she only had a maddroom s on the floor and her room because but i mean no that was busar now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things r i i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (5631/ 8002) 
just employers need to be employers just need to do that on their own and it is tough to be able to trust uh a business like that but it is a private business they need to be able to

Recording: (5633/ 8002)

Recording: (5793/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5794/ 8002) 
i think it has changed drasticly on i think it is changing an i think it wiill wolcsol be changing ind the future uh going all the way back  uh finances uh we re we are not a consideration in he in oh i say probablyn my irst thirty may be forty years ther was some there was influes but i think phe influenc was not pinancial it was inpluence from the person who could get up phere an talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the weore topinion but i know that is not right it he sway them with a position that he had dheveloped now that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point there< but he would sway them based uppon the influences that he had had from uh uh various people within his community or whether whether you are talking about a coun ship pror counti state whatever it may be and yes u uh then pr slowly then i thin the finances came in the play and finances have come to uh horrible horrible situation as of today and i will leave out this the the last two years it ha of course it is becaurse it is rather  specific right now bute going back to two years or four years ago finances we are still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on thea national level but i am sainon even on local levels i know wwithin the meda communitythere are people oult theire uh ha come oon we will go r to den or we will doll to this an we will do this and do this justh just barely  barly braking uh the bariar but not braking the law uh so yes bery definitly progressively has changed 

Recording: (5795/ 8002) 
no the funnyest thing that was with my husband and the youngest  because he is so he is so fair and he sit in the hospital people were looking at him like there is no way that could happen he said that because you know they take them off to way hem or whatever and i said you do not leave him and he said people were looking at him like 

Recording: (5796/ 8002) 
and they never were i mean the same with like in france especially  mcdonald is wel mcdonald is is full of all the french people you know i mean 

Recording: (5797/ 8002) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something that will giv them a little bit oa hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of probabing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for if for you growing up and going into a life style i would prefer having they ire college is paid for and then being productive citizens then somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean ow that is ike broad spectrum and i know it is not all that cut and drud um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best 

Recording: (5798/ 8002) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes t his ant my is you know  js b mo you know < look up okay buy n that it

Recording: (5835/ 8002) 
because they have done away with uh civil service step raisers which were wrong because i could have done a crumpy job and got the same raise as doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you e got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they have no idea of what you are even doing

Recording: (5887/ 8002) 
ell that is probably the roogf raght there so

Recording: (5939/ 8002) 
it was columbus he went to uh fort haiyse 

Recording: (5940/ 8002) 
u about twelve 

Recording: (5941/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5942/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (5943/ 8002) 
i amsorry 

Recording: (5944/ 8002) 
you know they want to be judg like everybody else but i you know i think um they have so many different ideas and not that either one of them is right but still um i i think there is always going a barrior there they are just kids are just not all kids are going tao get along you know i mean 

Recording: (5945/ 8002) 
yeah shoud have been in class 

Recording: (5946/ 8002) 
oh lots of people travel all over uh you know i mean that is i do not lots of people do you know i mean they would do shows on christmas if they had them but uh you know i i do ten twelve a year 

Recording: (5947/ 8002) 
uh okay okay it is parto of growing up andi kn i have been there and done that too but still you hov to you have to um know there is  respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and thot jus demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they solve the inter action with the elder people the school whou went to there is a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and theyire teachers are they are ticket takers uh monitrin the crowd where the kids i ask hin i said do you gonys ever go home no whely ah is it but they are always there they are not they are just teaching a class hey are not theire preparing the class they are there aft the class they aretheire for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that itis a continuation of my philossufy at home we interact ththe school is great you have people that are on the clock wht trying to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but theif they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is having problems at work and i are willing to work with that person i say whilling to work not knowing they are goingto be compencate it because theywill be compensated not tnete sarye materialistically they will bhemon  then when they are expect hathey will them re compensate  somewhere but the thing is to lind an open hand not knowing wel gjee what is fo what is in it for me what is in it fore you is itand then tangible are you are willing 

Recording: (5948/ 8002) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brotherinlaw is ga and when i met him i knew he was i you know he was the type some of them you can not tell wel it does not matter what they looked like um but my husband said all through growing up he liked men he did not mlike girls you looked  magazines you know all this stuff and i thougt thut is so funny because grown up i just did not know know anyboy that was um but you know he was openly gates his mother right from the beginning and she was from germany which made it a little tough because you know they did not talk about hit thoutt those things over there at all for a long time but um then she became very open with him and every but everybody knew and hat was in the eighties and you know if some kids know it when they are young and growing up you know i do not know if it is best do not say it or too you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are going ta deal with h a lot better then then if they waiht later on and their life you know but some m sometimes i guess they change you know most of the men i knew right ou the butt you know i mean i mean it was notand it was all through their life it was not is though they just said well i mean i am gong nol be gay 

Recording: (5949/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (5950/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5951/ 8002) 
and so it it is the thing is thoug it is almost like i am really glad that willing to say i just can not make those he ul let he  let my daughter who i her he left left her at the movie is one night they went to the movies there was no um the movie they went to see was soled out the next one was not going to start until nine thirty which means his kid is twelve years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve  you know at the lenexs he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and althoughs is tomboy who is just amazing but so any how he left her there and i they said they called me but i did no i was run the sweeper so i dint er the phone so left her there and he  said that she was going to call back you know an at a certain time and i was going t tell her what she couldhave could not do so i said you know he gongno havn to come heare at home you know he is gong to have to come and get you ol come on no we are not going to do that i you know yhou can not be just like so he went back down picked him up and i said let the kid come to our house he can n come here until eleven 

Recording: (5952/ 8002) 
< ah 

Recording: (5953/ 8002) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because thery should still be u normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (5954/ 8002) 
very different uh just been a lot of innovations and 

Recording: (5955/ 8002) 
<

Recording: (6009/ 8002) 
right umhum 

Recording: (6010/ 8002) 
umhum it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is a good it is probably good for me because  i am so it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want te blive you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (6011/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (6012/ 8002)

Recording: (6015/ 8002)

Recording: (6042/ 8002) 
um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do ind life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but

Recording: (6048/ 8002) 
right and well and there is nothing wrong with that

i had somebody calld and they were doing a survey and they wante on what hi did for living and when thi told them they said well we are done < 

Recording: (6068/ 8002) 
i am guessing 

Recording: (6069/ 8002) 
oh < i do no knw what didi it mean well it is you instead of going to your classroom you go into a room where you have you sit and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can not talk or anything 

Recording: (6070/ 8002) 
did not hear about thatr 

Recording: (6071/ 8002) 
gee 

Recording: (6072/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (6073/ 8002) 
oh gosh i that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (6074/ 8002) 
they set different rules up fine give me to wore mins ta play 

Recording: (6075/ 8002) 
and work later than which was fine by me or he would cll and e oud says okay if i work o late andt would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that 

Recording: (6076/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6077/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6078/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6079/ 8002) 
umhum do you know a a group called uh midnight oil yeah < they are pretty good i like them yeah 

Recording: (6080/ 8002) 
but with kids in they are just so much more active at a early age 

Recording: (6081/ 8002) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not righ there is like there is a lot of tlike between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the rigti directon  we hve a a nice solid middle incm middle inan it middle income base i think beaus a lot of countries only have the tlike i visited mexico and seems like they only have the distinction between the upper and lower i mean theire middle class is very small and that i but that economy is coming along too and i mean it it t will be it i developing itself which is which is nice i took a tour of a a plant down there because my my  my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equiplent of like seven bucks a day but they get s they get bostin to work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because they they like a hot meal lik they have a cafterio there because i wis talking tof the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and hey will be hungry so it it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (6082/ 8002) 
umhum i do not know that they would use the inforatonat theyad t i i do not know 

Recording: (6083/ 8002) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are going ta have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (6084/ 8002) 
you are grounded uh yeah< 

Recording: (6085/ 8002) 
and they fly checks like if you write a check today and you deposit it in the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearing house and that is all they do all night long 

Recording: (6086/ 8002) 
oh yeah and you know i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook read meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make sups a lot of good sups for him with meat and it really does not bother me to cook it you know i am not gon n sit home and make a roast every night 

Recording: (6087/ 8002) 
that hat is her job was u spoile them so the for things ihave like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground p 

Recording: (6088/ 8002) 
a little geography would not hurt 

Recording: (6089/ 8002) 
yeah so basically i learn with him yoa hold happor do this do that 

Recording: (6090/ 8002) 
no that time 

Recording: (6091/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (6092/ 8002) 
well yeah 

Recording: (6093/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6094/ 8002) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (6095/ 8002) 
that would probably change my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6096/ 8002) 
teachers a couple f teachers decide take a bunch of every couple of years they go to a different countri 

Recording: (6097/ 8002) 
um actually it is more it is almost actually turned into like self business um like i said iwoul started out with my dad and teh people would ask me what i was doind i tell them anybod i o l ilil have some things around the house that need to be done and so i would go there thand they would tell people than 

Recording: (6098/ 8002) 
it might be 

Recording: (6099/ 8002) 
no painting was needed um well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and uh uh scratched out the first rating and changed it toa lower rating um and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate 

Recording: (6100/ 8002) 
oh well that is unfortunate she i 

Recording: (6101/ 8002) 
i think um the people who have already graduated there like to the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids did not wan to go hit it is just thought of it is a somewhat party school 

Recording: (6102/ 8002) 
yeah and and and everybody is going ta associate withhe people that you feel comfortable with so you know and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was a center for the football team as he grew up older you know uh he realized that he was and iis the big as important ash  u he blew out his knee for u oh you you know bu i went to i went to school with larry hunter who is the uh basketball coach for uh o you now and uh and he had the same thing happend to him bu he had a scholarship arrou and both of his knees are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ball player probably one ofthe best ones i hav ever seen and uh bribled like a larry bird you know back in that day and everything and uh but one hack nice guy you know never let it get tor

yeah and  like i do not know the that state is notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night 

Recording: (6104/ 8002) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get hey are act togetheyar because they are going to have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know i am going to play in a rok band uh you know they all think they are gong to be wrock stars and drummers and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life < du jisis my one real life better not throw it away they wast time you know they lose stuff y

Recording: (6150/ 8002) 
no i think we are only for insainside they class i mean a lot of them i have known from middle school and following them up and you know they just all go theyre different wenus like the one girl i was for nt with i wor a park i mean she was a great lower than me but when we hve seen each other in the halls lik hay was up and and we woul talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that and high school i did not know anything i i know she was bad  and that was it < 

Recording: (6151/ 8002) 
it was we had a little galary um we were in clitan ville for a a year or so and then we moved to grandview and it was just fine art we call it fine art crafts and it was hand made stuff from local people and we had a lot of jewelry and pottery and silk and paintings that kind of stuff 

Recording: (6152/ 8002) 
you know he says that he equles mce squared i say it is eeqles mc cubed because  the world is three dimentional it is not two dimentional uh two dimentional limits everything but you look at his theory relativity all of our mathmaticcal therums physical theriums on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (6153/ 8002) 
yeah i do too 

Recording: (6154/ 8002) 
exactly but i do therr there is the other side um h uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly you are giving up your children and and and something has to be done but but there is also there is also that he i am i mean i think it is probably a legitimate fear that children o children of that group are going t you know going to be homoginized out of out of their heritage but i do not know uh you know thear kids without parents < 

Recording: (6155/ 8002)

sont an hi school 

Recording: (6162/ 8002) 
oh i do not really think so i think of myself wis kind of an impatient person but i guess i do not i guess i do not i do not get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and they do not yell and scream out ofth ma i mean realize they din asked to have a learning dis ability in mean the and then they can not they are not some teachers think they are just being beliderent and i they want to staighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they can not change theyir learnng tis ability any more an you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with hit it is gennetic someone else and their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down in to pieces or teach it af different way it is like teaching them math probbem too diferent ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn by but well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say and you say turn a page three ninety three or and they turn to three thirty nine and their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual ey and the ear and then worek gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled some how and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day and they iar shees you probably have a lot of impathy for th them

Recording: (6290/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6291/ 8002) 
siuh uh coming back to your school he said it was pretty good but you were not chalenged  what d you think 

Recording: (6292/ 8002) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know < 

Recording: (6293/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6294/ 8002) 
that is the way we figure in a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean there is times when we did not know where he was for a week ora week at a time he i was driving lain avenue once and saw him beaging money on the street and tit is it is it is pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (6295/ 8002) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to um enforce that so 

Recording: (6296/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6297/ 8002) 
hopefully 

Recording: (6298/ 8002)

Recording: (6306/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (6307/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (6308/ 8002) 
but you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they change their mind and stuff is the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but that is not going ta happen in this case i do not think and  because of her age and this makes  nho sense to me the state law says that she has to have custady the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so that you knowthey are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not wan to take the baby home because they are afraid of being two attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere fort because her mother smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic uh they 

Recording: (6309/ 8002)

Recording: (6475/ 8002) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i am do not know i think it is like a lot of times  they are really desparate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the  place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean i mean i it is working well enough i guess i mean s t like people are learning things and like wanting to go in to college and stuff 

Recording: (6476/ 8002) 
some of the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (6477/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6478/ 8002) 
it is very difficult 

Recording: (6479/ 8002) 
< think he needs counceling that poit 

Recording: (6480/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6481/ 8002)

Recording: (6483/ 8002) 
i a i am impressed i am like okay i tried to buld a car and it did not look like anth 

Recording: (6484/ 8002) 
it is probably a family by family i mean < that is why i was a little bit layte leaving work the way it was they are the are we have got too coworkeris one um has her child it the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and and lisstening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she is dropped off at six a am and not picked up till six thirty pm and she is fine with that me personally there s no way becaus somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onder that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and hi is been in day care now for three weeks and she is going to go she is she is going no put her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (6485/ 8002) 
yeah i think so i think so and like they just neither of the candidates really seems like they have that much entegrity to me you know so 

Recording: (6486/ 8002) 
ndshe got a divorce when i was three 

Recording: (6487/ 8002) 
you do not you do not use cupons 

Recording: (6488/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6489/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (6490/ 8002) 
yeure 

Recording: (6491/ 8002) 
but when you look at coman he thinks there was a point where they they asked yes or no question 

Recording: (6492/ 8002) 
theng you can go visit what the empires that the big thing like the statue of liberty 

Recording: (6493/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6494/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6495/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6496/ 8002) 
i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what sgeedit is on 

Recording: (6497/ 8002) 
that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i have been cross trained or hire want to say it i can working three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raises and i have seen me get two percent raise when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (6498/ 8002) 
um about fifteen mins my mom and i do not go too far fro  so but jason is going to take the week off on everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (6499/ 8002) 
i think society us today up today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being by ont of u it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there are bad wites too you know so but not all of them are you know are that way 

Recording: (6500/ 8002) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she is still  she is lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own uppon cooking and stuff like that which i love to cook 

Recording: (6501/ 8002) 
um i do more summer sports but um he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer litery i have really never had a job yet it is always been working with food or plants 

Recording: (6502/ 8002) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for 

Recording: (6503/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6504/ 8002) 
ll this other stuff 

Recording: (6505/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6506/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6507/ 8002)

Recording: (6512/ 8002)

Recording: (6513/ 8002) 
is actually not that difficult but 

Recording: (6514/ 8002) 
little girl i i always think you should name a kidad i have opinions about everything see i think you should name a kid something that will fit him at eighty three and eight and m between like we named our son robert so when he was little he was robby now he is eighteen he is rob when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert pall you know and in kindergarten all he hald learned to righte was arob or ar ob b wy so that  you know i have a hard time picture in an eighty three year old woman as a tammy

just give me a couple of shirts or somethng you know she always bought my clothes anyway so so just give me a couple  give me whatever you think i need you know i will be here drinking beer watching sports yo knw 

Recording: (6516/ 8002) 
so that is i guess i do have some family  by mariage but they live near bloomington 

Recording: (6517/ 8002) 
uh well i think only because i went abroad i had basically one extra quarter beyond four years

so if you are not wearing the nikes < 

Recording: (6519/ 8002) 
test yeah 

Recording: (6520/ 8002) 
yeah high school a lot of people are really narrow minded and work on really trying to fit in and college people are more open i like open minded and they are more willing to express their own ideas

um it is considered urban but because it is north of acker and we play like a lot of theke the inter citye like in acran schools but in my opinion it is suburbia like but we have the we have the big city problems like there is a lot of drugs and i think that is just because the building is old so kno one really takes pride in it and then it is two thousand people

Recording: (6596/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (6597/ 8002) 
i do not know i had not thought about that um i d not no i do not i do not get the impression thet values has anything to do with what they are doing in thi school 

Recording: (6598/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6599/ 8002) 
went on but i am not sure about the rest 

Recording: (6600/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6601/ 8002) 
wow 

Recording: (6602/ 8002)

Recording: (6603/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6604/ 8002) 
uhu

Recording: (6606/ 8002) 
and they leave and then you get either aanother ashol or somebody good yu just wait untill you get somebody good 

Recording: (6607/ 8002) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that an uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many unwanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country um more or a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (6608/ 8002) 
have you really have you gotn to see the all the shows and 

Recording: (6609/ 8002)

Recording: (6610/ 8002) 
chances or thrancet whatever famali female so that was her name fo mali she thought boy they are nice in this country they even name my babby for me < people are so stupid 

Recording: (6611/ 8002) 
dhan that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is where wo learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are uh uh a parent getting a giving a allowance you do not give them the your kids uh money to do chors they  normally expect them to do but you give them something in addition to deveup more responsibility < but we do not talk about responsibility our socitey to day i i i dare you to say we are  they say publically this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do you talk about responsibility now 

Recording: (6612/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6613/ 8002) 
i do uhhuh yeah 

Recording: (6614/ 8002) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have fined like one or two guns so and that to me was but my high school is is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (6615/ 8002) 
totally like the directions and the homework and everything is all one hundred percent in german

Recording: (6619/ 8002) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (6620/ 8002)

Recording: (6643/ 8002) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yeah the special kid who has no area that he des non excelling like once i had a six grade girl who still did not know her time tables and six grade but she had a beverally cells opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that wan all kind of mettals and gimnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i have had kids who hve thay got every bad you can getting boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that they are really it might not be related to school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in some other area like there is swimming or or scouting or whatever so they you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than the normal person with a hunderd or ninety five icu yeahn i have seen them long enough to know that and worked with hem long enough to know that well like i have one boy who can not spell them he still spells at t ach i m and he took my computer apart the other day and at justed something in the mothere board and put it back to gether now it works 

Recording: (6644/ 8002) 
that is good to be there 

Recording: (6645/ 8002) 
oh yeah uh yec and thuh they a kind of weird ike sat u one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever saysn anything they are  set on the other side that they are a little bit more racust um but at the same time i i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people they are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people an they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that theare racas towards i mean i the same thing that goes with white people lobviously they are whikte people that you can stand they are white people that are just of nocxus and you do not want to deal with um i mean it is pasically the same thing  ah uh yeah uh yeah yeah yeah exactly uh ium i really do not think we do for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems  or anything like that hat occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president u onestly um although i do not really see too many sexas problems li definitely do see guy is still being more like the decision mak king type and as being like the final say and thing rather thaand women and i would see theme having an athority figure that is being a woman s caublsing problems to them 

Recording: (6646/ 8002) 
and they do not know any different 

Recording: (6647/ 8002)

his mother died u the week after whe got married she had diabidis um juven o diabidis ith diagnose at the age of lovan and just over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and did not make it trough the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse < it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (6650/ 8002) 
i mean they will be  it seems to me they are more one liners so i am a little disappointed i am sad that the show is going off  h hat the show is going ta stop but i am not as sad because of the product i am getting now it with the simsans i m i am having it being replaced by futureama which uh i find to be absolute genious and so it is not so bad exfiles i am sad but not as sad based in the past cupple ens i when despace and ine went of the the eair that one really bothered me and i even had a star treck replacement 

Recording: (6651/ 8002) 
you know i certainly would not and would i expect my mom to stay with with that in thear kind of a situation no way i would want her to be happy and i would want my dad to be happy also so ultimately for that situation i think it was much better um they got married kind of young too you know and i think that i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more careful i know that that now it is a lot different than it used to be people would get married and they would just be expected to stay together and there is a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they are miserab

Recording: (6657/ 8002) 
ell i got the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun and waiys around the school you know that is the big thing now but just the you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support clear up through the administration at if they do have a they have to wait untill something is pretty pretty agrigious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (6658/ 8002)

Recording: (6711/ 8002) 
really well i jus because it is close to japan 

Recording: (6712/ 8002) 
so hard i mean every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the fors sgrating period is no ough and when y my you know oldest daughter went to northlane first becaus he i thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching and acadame there and once she got into it she went only bou knot  so i said well wha you know whatever so then she wanted to go t because it is basically ah columebas publeck school that is gear to college only i meand if if youare not going to college do not go there because you will flong caut it is very hard and she got in thi second year three weeks before school started and so wee go over there and they hand er this stack auf material that is got to be done in three weeks so i thought well i will just call and i he called and i have taught teprin ewln to said you know they gave us all this stuff and you knw everybody else his had june july oll il ghss to get this done and she is got three weeks and she goes and the principale goes that is correct and i go well there is no waiht she can get this done an know i said you know everybody else is had all this time and she is going to gt it done three weeks and they go that is right so they take there is no excuses you know and it is it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest whaul do horrible there because you know basically they say uh we are talking about china this week and uh on de sember the fifteenth we want ta report one why chinese people do what they do you know  it is like aund every week they do not come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the outline right and it is upe to you to go goh sho i have to have an outline i have to avebutibuti ography  i haveto have the piact so i have to interview some people and if you do not sit ountwith ar litl calender and go this wee gone eand this done this wee goin t getnd this done this you just fail so my oldest daughter is pretty uh detail oriented so after we kon of helped her start you know and saiy you knw you are you are going ta have to do these things so you get this done i said and basically get it done like two weeks be fore it is done so then you can say oh this is not very good and you know amended or whatever or helped somebody you know get somebody what  ctypying  whatever so she is really good and it is it is helped her at school a lotecause i know they uh she she toured here to  ewstate and thee if some people her that  come frome cals and they go this will be easier then you are high school  so

no sunlight you know that and they do not give him they keep it warm and they he is not a lowt of sheets or raisors or you know other thanan electric raser so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck e there is no thing you coul do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me t would be tliyk that to me he is actually like that has to be worse like just a agony and the and  i think you would have to go and say an like there is reallyh so much you i wouo actufor board games or something but like yheu can does not even hear a human voice because i think it is something like that was ritten in the scriptures like you are dead to the world foru is the worst that you can do and so ththe world sees him you know tan i mean so that would be rough that would be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i like they say like now like people that observe thim he is like he sings to himself and he reads the bible like every day and but like i do not know that would be strange it would b is such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being locked in a room for like a few days 

Recording: (6715/ 8002) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get

Recording: (6823/ 8002) 
you know always something going on

Recording: (6833/ 8002) 
i am retired 

Recording: (6834/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6835/ 8002) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching an th shanme thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and a long with the politicians they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public an staid of what we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (6836/ 8002) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you < yeah yeah 

Recording: (6837/ 8002) 
i know i do not a 

Recording: (6838/ 8002) 
thing toowhen you tr 

Recording: (6839/ 8002) 
no big deallas 

Recording: (6840/ 8002) 
but we still need to have property management records hit is very essential and a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it uh they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it is been uh installed removed relocated whereit might be but we nee to know that how it ha impact upon the design of a particular uh facility voice end data 

Recording: (6841/ 8002) 
i think the news media s hyped it up too much really wi mean we have an accord with cuba that  says anyone that is trying to escaped from  cuba  united states that is found at see is immediately returned to cuba welth you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castrois that is the premiche is operating on uh you know and the news media they have not really been uhe justy have not been real objective about it i mean uh you now k here are two fisherman that found him at see you never hear about the other one because thay this was on one just breefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him i was reading about a news week or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (6842/ 8002) 
um you know stuff like that it is like it is kind of neat because you do no have to pay we will you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (6843/ 8002) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (6844/ 8002) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i i know it is like i mean it is the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but uh it just seems more apparent just because of how  you can like go outside all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (6845/ 8002) 
yeah like hit is just  s killing itis own citizens it is so ridiculous 

Recording: (6846/ 8002)

all i remember is them talking about condems i do not think they talked about anything besides that but um than again i could be reebering rong um but yes that i mean it is the stand but i think in the schools i mean that i sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have nons or anything there i mean u you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know  i actually it might have ben later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple  like eighth grade that they u talked about condoms i dout that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (6897/ 8002) 
i mean i i i mean that probably cann be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that you know it wit the the fluence of tv you know thet and then an another thing that is well tv is in uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokamon right now

Recording: (6907/ 8002) 
right well that is something i have noticed in the local news particularly lately they say exclusively on our channel and stuff and it is usually not that big of a deal what they are talking about  but they are making a big point that youe heard it here first and i mean if you hear  five minutes earlier on one station an an other what difference does it make

um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community base programs getting but again those are my values ias no say stearing the kids into a churce base program if they can not be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them givething them the guidancthat they need the wy m ca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (6993/ 8002)

Recording: (6995/ 8002)

Recording: (6996/ 8002) 
i seling time for money i guess 

Recording: (6997/ 8002) 
yeah inow i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen in high school so we kind of grew up together and i did not know anything else and um just two complete different people you know different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (6998/ 8002) 
oh you did not 

Recording: (6999/ 8002) 
o< 

Recording: (7000/ 8002) 
adoption is different i think thuh wirh hit hen adoption is entirely different than when you can seeve wit somebody else is spurm or somebody else is whatever uh because idoption means that i can no have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and you are then you are reaching out to your friend youare neighbor you are not just forgetting about thimg an let the welper somebody take chare of them and let them go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is and  and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is lup and when yu are trying and willing to have well some people wiull probably aregue about this but i am sorry if got did not mean that i can can see even have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside ofe me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs  needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already a where to a certain extent of what geens sey y might ave enherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not  it later on you wil find out but if still you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are gon to be able to trace thee geens back and say you know  later on if something happens that this child you are having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it ot and help the child better 

Recording: (7001/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7002/ 8002) 
some ideal ideas about it so i a i figured something i should know about so << 

Recording: (7003/ 8002) 
i i i  i do not think it is necessary tot tha i think it just comes back to the lack of selfdiscipline 

Recording: (7004/ 8002) 
um the reason that it was one of the bestiers of my life is i an i incredibly beautiful sutting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idallis tic and incredibly searching for answers and um uh mean their questions in their conversations talk about opinion < as a matter of fact hat that i soly thng i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these inredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or sothing mothing like that was like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions 

Recording: (7005/ 8002) 
at cosi 

Recording: (7006/ 8002) 
right right 

Recording: (7007/ 8002)

Recording: (7008/ 8002) 
e okay < 

Recording: (7009/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7010/ 8002)

Recording: (7011/ 8002) 
and so when my sister and i graduated we each bot each othera doll baby and i got mine to this day because wul not even let my daughter play with her < you know 

Recording: (7012/ 8002)

Recording: (7013/ 8002) 
my dad like 

Recording: (7014/ 8002) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldam saw black people on tv and then you started seeing a couple of black people on tv and then there was the jeffhersons and although i found the jeffhersons offensive in many ways because it wase sterio typical and made fun of of of black people and many ways in retrospect it was trend setting and what it did and and even in putting blacks in um advertisements on tv young kids saw them uh and and saw those ads and saw those tv programs and so it became uh ah part of everyday life an and the more you see something the more it be becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having and in fact maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of sterio typical u but i am sure it does have uh some influence because it i think it did it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the pusle that that helps i think mathew shepherd helpd also 

Recording: (7015/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7016/ 8002) 
and 

Recording: (7017/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (7018/ 8002)

Recording: (7019/ 8002)

and a lot of times unions uh they actually actually seem detrimental like to productio andto like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because  if a union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy a lazy union as a representative of of these workers so they are more apt to go outside

Recording: (7204/ 8002) 
when 

Recording: (7205/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7206/ 8002) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of rosas and those types of things you can get some that are older that need to need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (7207/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (7208/ 8002) 
okayi i i 

Recording: (7209/ 8002) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there weare a lot of jobs about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple of english friends and to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and it we wre got lost and all these things hat took us way along ago and it should have ben a friend of the person we were visiting said like oh what did you have to stop at every micdonald i along the way and i was like i i om  vegetari and i do not even eat im mcdonald is you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it is like that is n not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said micdonald i would not survive here if no one eight there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7210/ 8002) 
youyou had womenthat are wrking befor you had womene workng before but self discipline dos not break then on a family that is part of it self discipline making things too easy for us oh we can not do thout itd you ever d you ever try to work for so i mean you really truggle to atchieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7211/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (7212/ 8002) 
then my sister lives in the middle of nebraska  nobody visits < obody wants to go to nebraska yeah what is out there i ma come wath yheur corn growv 

Recording: (7213/ 8002) 
well i have a< maybe when i i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7214/ 8002) 
or des hit say this you know this is what i thought thi said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my six scritters turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and they are whether they travel and groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how  spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestabules 

Recording: (7215/ 8002) 
so um 

Recording: (7216/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7217/ 8002) 
i went to um for grade school and um for high school 

Recording: (7218/ 8002) 
yeah just an smart 

Recording: (7219/ 8002) 
and there is lighting effects like strow blades disco balls 

Recording: (7220/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7221/ 8002) 
existing area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7222/ 8002) 
light news uh that is why i read you tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a different perspective it i it is probably just  slanted but it is different you are right 

Recording: (7223/ 8002) 
than i 

Recording: (7224/ 8002) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (7225/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7226/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7227/ 8002) 
d then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (7228/ 8002) 
eah 

Recording: (7229/ 8002) 
okay  a t 

Recording: (7230/ 8002) 
actually they are they are working o than i am sorry d  meanon forfar  um they have they have um just in stat et some bone skeems where as the poverty let a level i think is considere them theirteen thousand pounds a yeare um and if if you are below the poverty level and you you go aback to work you get a sertaen like ack sre bones beyond you know so there is a bonus for back to work you mention arally are about like how this whould affect the children with thi to your welhere thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system theire for for whatever reasm then i do about this is tem here wit i cind of nfortunate but um there i mean i do not really think and a lot of situations of course i am ure theyire  people who polly as he shiu be and who who really need it and who really you know ta can care of theyire uhildren  but un fortunately you do not really see that si very much you see the people who like theire kids see none of tha money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you knw get them to school if they even go te school if they are yeven botheire you know and you know those you know a lot of they are they are j ockou menturies on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your fa then an is heare that i ever knoticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if a if he kid has bad behavior or you know bat  tend ins thet you send them home i mean i think that s the mos rediculous thing like surely thats  not up punisiment for a lot of these kids and you know at lease in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing what ever going around the neghborhoold choplufting ble ing you know a hot wiring cars t the age or you know ten or something and i do n know i think i do have sort ofvous tro apinions about people you know who are having all these kids ind dor tate care of them at all 

Recording: (7231/ 8002) 
okayh 

Recording: (7232/ 8002) 
hum um things like that  thin that those accommodate people who do not want o live with the tough restrictions those catholic and om a that

Recording: (7261/ 8002) 
okay < 

Recording: (7262/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7263/ 8002) 
but it just depends poni still comes back to who you are now 

Recording: (7264/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7265/ 8002) 
utis because it is kind of like warm and chopical is that is why they like it down there 

Recording: (7266/ 8002) 
at is 

Recording: (7267/ 8002) 
but 

Recording: (7268/ 8002) 
no bats 

Recording: (7269/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7270/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (7271/ 8002) 
oh what are you doing that for u 

Recording: (7272/ 8002) 
hum 

Recording: (7273/ 8002) 
um not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage i are god they go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually i this  is isa very hot topic in england right nown because they are they have got the highest rate of teen age pregnancy in the world and i mean therer stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condoms on play grounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurs is office is one thing they are there you know they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is about idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think it is pretty important just you know because of the simple factor the stitistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very at least they might as well be you know seyfe about it 

Recording: (7274/ 8002) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think a at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times you can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children bse how many accidents happen to children like they hale always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7275/ 8002) 
yeah she still has ha family oh 

Recording: (7276/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7277/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (7278/ 8002) 
yeahli 

Recording: (7279/ 8002) 
oh my 

Recording: (7280/ 8002) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because the nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (7281/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7282/ 8002) 
oh yeah yeah ike what religion are you < oh that one has allf those tho going rules that do not work out in real life christianity y 

Recording: (7283/ 8002) 
right no 

Recording: (7284/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7285/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7286/ 8002) 
i mean i 

Recording: (7287/ 8002) 
it is like like sometimes do i think about people you know they call and  and especially when i talke to the sometimes people call in and i i ta you know i get the same people or whatever r one s will especially ifi like there is people have real specific weird names or something that i can n remember ow they will call back and i wil think about i mean it is like how i have this you know it s like we have this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like e every couple of weeks or something and it is like  to think about what their life is like n what they are are actually like and theyu know it is like it is real weirdit is likeu now eaht everybody 

Recording: (7288/ 8002) 
right and and it sometimes that opens um the person up because a child they are so innocent and you can not help but love them and i know my mom had a big problem with they whold inter racial 

Recording: (7289/ 8002) 
oh really 

Recording: (7290/ 8002) 
now that is interesting though because i think i think that that my whole i i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (7291/ 8002) 
ell they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they um try to intervene with their family and put them back with their family or um maybe call in childreni services and and i just really do not think much of childreni services so 

Recording: (7292/ 8002) 
actually um i went back i came back to a higow state um in te ninety three through ninety five and got a teaching certificut in science for secondary cience and i taught for a year uh at a small school in lankester a catholic high school down there ind uh left there u prartaly if it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in tha classroom soid thit was probably one of the biggest problems i had < but uh 

Recording: (7293/ 8002) 
but uh she likes the spirituality of the community over there and 

Recording: (7294/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7295/ 8002) 
you know it if it does not affect them it is not there and if they do not have to 

Recording: (7296/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (7297/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (7298/ 8002) 
he wants to yeah 

Recording: (7299/ 8002) 
yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school i went to i mean i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run nto a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7300/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7301/ 8002) 
okay well there a few years ago there was this big fuss an you know we have got a closhe some schools we you know enrolment is dropping it is you know just the way population gos  enrolment is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so lit is close and thiy ji is big study and they target i is don to close well there ias a big uproar for the people this kids went to that school like theyre will be whenever you close the school so the board back down and changed it s moning than next yeare they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there was not ha money for it so there was a big fuss about that then two years later they come out with another study thit says whll they need to refer  be sure not some schools close a couple and then nock sthome down and rebuilt them and it is like every two years hit is a different direction and it is like they are al most afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going tao like well if you are going to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (7302/ 8002) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them a better school um i think a lot of it is is is really what you what as far as as a parent is what you expect your children to atchieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced ap classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think that they have options 

Recording: (7303/ 8002) 
they do not get i do not think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they they raise money from the businesses in the community plus we charge for tickets < for people to come and see us and sometimes it is sometimes we get a lot sometimes we do not get so many turns out the concerts we get the most the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we havehe children is quire  because 

Recording: (7304/ 8002) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grad him on that he might have a shot at a ceevor a be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes of his or crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is it looks just like notbook paper and it is got three holes in the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but it is ncr you know the two copies when 

Recording: (7305/ 8002) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and uh close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just as exciting it is still just as good and you  he amazes me every day because i am i am one oh this will not last forever but you know< and he is like wel when we are ninety you know you woll know < so

okay 

Recording: (7310/ 8002) 
< 

Recording: (7311/ 8002) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet uh you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and ponography and you know things that we you know when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was in to you know lasse and tom and jear i mean you know thes but you know they were not finalent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i just think i do not think it could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (7312/ 8002) 
right right 

Recording: (7313/ 8002) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like ther traditional style so it is like more of like a respect is upposed to like an admiration type thing like like it is more of like uh it is not like an mtv type thing yuh

Recording: (7342/ 8002) 
my thesis is on the sudatan germans those are the germans who lived in checca sylvakia uh before the second world war and uh specifically i am looking at how they perceved their condition switching from being part of the austro hungarian empire uh and the germans being sort of the the majority uh even though they were not the majority but sort of the the uh the master nation within the austro hungarian empire to be coming uh  a minority within checka silvakia 

Recording: (7343/ 8002) 
maybe i will move to australia 

Recording: (7344/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (7345/ 8002) 
ido not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (7346/ 8002) 
where 

Recording: (7347/ 8002) 
in uh first grade his teacher knew that he needed that but the principle would not allow her to do it uhand that is one reason we put him in different school for second grade uh 

Recording: (7348/ 8002) 
i do not have nothing like that nowadays somebody fall through the ice and they oul see them 

Recording: (7349/ 8002) 
you know when she is in her middle years and tamera whend she is you know but you know i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing it is the one thing in life we get ta do where there is no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or peramiters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 

Recording: (7350/ 8002) 
well i do not know that that is a cause u  it they they as a group uh  this was kind of tha happenstance and it this occurred as a result of a vherve he major worold war uh so n an in terms of them causing it  it was  it was a happentance and ind part of this mask communication we are talking about uh began with them and yase they are a major nfluence becau hew are talking about numbers and you are talking about uh uh great a greater inter communication i would like to go back one ste where we are talking about when i made mention that threedoo ors down you do not ebe know who that inthivhidual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we or nearring ziro in terms of global mass communication to everybody with inter personal communioccations that is the kee in my opinion personal versus interpersonal communications a an and it zero ver hearm ore almos a hundrerd percent over here but whenwe are in this inter persional or globle or maci of what you ever term is the mose appropriat uh jon dow who speak here he has not ha faintst idea who gaindo is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah yu knew who this person ris over here that is janedo that lives and that thired out an he married henrijackson do ntyermemmer ov henry wher henrwas teguy liv wey over there ind the other side of town mask communications as it is today a have not tha fhaintest idea o where gancame from or where henry jackon or where od whoevery wars lived over there i said so i think  i incom need te distinguish between the personal interpersonal relationship so maybe i  die cras to far there b or who the next door nighber is 

Recording: (7351/ 8002) 
that is exactly what it 

Recording: (7352/ 8002) 
oh really 

Recording: (7353/ 8002) 
oh really i had not heard thatayah now t t um some of it when clinton is backed down i think i sort of sumerize what i just said is you know for the health insurance and reform ofh that all that health insurance area it um yeah he backed down but it was not gong ta happen so he could keep you know the furor going for months and months or years and still nothing was going to happen it was the wrong time whe we trid to move on just something else um i think it is regretable it has not come back like yeu said it is like wel i made the one attempt and did not go anywhere si lis lht it rop and count for somebody else to pick it up well clinton said lame duck it ise way can not even bring it back 

Recording: (7354/ 8002)

Recording: (7355/ 8002)

Recording: (7356/ 8002) 
yeah just having fun 

Recording: (7357/ 8002)

Recording: (7360/ 8002) 
if you just said take or get i just i say well i am just goingna because when you get on work out in the work world there is going to be two things they care about about your writing is it usable and is it persuasive because usually when you are riting something in the work place it is either to explain something or it is to persuade somebody to do something so if it is not those two things it is not it is not writing that is going no make it in the world it is i mean 

Recording: (7361/ 8002) 
like ninety nine east ern broad or something like that 

Recording: (7362/ 8002) 
yeah at is where dor you i do not know he is outside somewhere

< a little less romantic 

Recording: (7367/ 8002) 
just because their parents are rich 

Recording: (7368/ 8002) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a downsid and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really dou need it and but you know as long as they have you know created a system whereby you know it will not be obviously is good for those people as it has been the onenes ho are denuinally unemployable but you know i think depending on how um sort of focus they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it is divided up i do not know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to steear them more in which ever direction the are most sueted for you know as vol as var as may be like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunnteering to be done everywheare and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you think that you can you knw there is something you know hopefully that i do not know

uhhuh uhhuh 

Recording: (7453/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7454/ 8002) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think ind to days world what they call the ninties that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else  we had standard s and when there were certain things we did or did not do and then iy came along with that when our kids grew up then there were so many things that change is some of the one thing i ju stains out and this s hit s o thing to do with politics but it is an example in in school they changed the way they were doing theirh mathematics i could not even help my kids with their matheamatics sometimes and i took geomatry n algibra you woul thinkou nd i used se as straight ages and algibae when i got to geomadtray thoug why im my taking this so  that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and their  teaching it entirely different now and i think linda explaine to how they were doing het with matheu and said she could not even help him an so you know it s in thehe same way with politics it  people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but then my mother used the sayit iag in about our generation so i think it is just the sine of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (7455/ 8002) 
yeah she she had to talk and my sister and i attendit and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little a scratch would go in you know a as opposed to like the very and  i think that could drive cost up so there has to be a wayh to balance i am not sure how you would go about doing that becaus youdo not want to put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7456/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7457/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (7521/ 8002) 
well i think

they will not take proper advantage of it because they have their parents to look up to who did not take advantage of it 

Recording: (7523/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7524/ 8002) 
the lawyers the judges everybody that works in that system i do not care who they are there is not an honest one in it i do not care there is not an onest one i they might think they are but once you expose yourself to corruption  you take that in with you 

Recording: (7525/ 8002) 
but even though you are not responsib i am the one a suppoed to be responsible the people you know that have the beer party in ther house yeah they they should be held responsible to some degree but we are in a society that loves to see people

Recording: (7548/ 8002) 
and i do think there is some and i do not thinku they would probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they would probably be exposed to you know the gay laws being i i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in dept you know about six and yor sexed classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i do not know our friends that have a eleven year old that is going to public schools i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry around this baby he went we went to a hcke game with him and here he is with this baby at this hacke game and it was just like at eleven

control problems ohf course there is always leak somewhir yeah well t could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plate but about now they drain that it is drained for the summer togifve u an opportunitity to work on leakes and stuff so they might hae drained it in that s wak qwat  yeahn run quick put plastic oh i do not know it seem like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here to high state where they have a union and they have so many diffrent skills in the union you you think ofe unions you think of alto workers you think of pipe fitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of people and that is very hard to negociate for anybody you know when you are talking raise is and lots of money like this what i what they we are going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades are not real big participators in the unioun you know we just ride along an from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here as it seems that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longger yoaund now a and so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we ju figured out that you o if they decide to strike we have nochoi too and you can not work because they will take all the money you ma crossing that line so you can not work anybod they came back to work will lose all the money that they make tho thay can tocort and no yeah the gains yeah it is against the union contract so you had tu

right um personally i think git is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completlyly different you know background and everything else and the education than a  you know than most of probably the people thet this would um concert but i do think  i i do not know i mean with the berth control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic foryou know these people who just have so many children than they can not feed they can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was not thing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if you know the the men is not willing to do it or whatever so and an and adoption and all the other things

civil rights u well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an alusion u yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of theire ethic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating and equal and fair society um ma ma maybe some may left is positions will lt come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based uppon where where in the social strattom you are born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these class i mean  i do not wan ta say classlines because that has so many like historical commutations because it is not the exact same as they class was in the markcis sens but classlines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is goin to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual

Recording: (7720/ 8002) 
and i i really feel like if you are going to run for president ia states you ought to be smart 

Recording: (7721/ 8002) 
said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was a word i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a vestibule is 

Recording: (7722/ 8002) 
too much 

Recording: (7723/ 8002) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leaway < but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of um not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much < yeah yeah 

Recording: (7724/ 8002) 
he is 

Recording: (7725/ 8002) 
but it was not because it caught fire and that time he was woring it on the back 

Recording: (7726/ 8002) 
as a tobbler and it is it is not intentional it is just the way he is so he was able to circumvent anything that the sychologist was trying untill he would finally admitted that yeah he had a problem and then things went much more smoothly and thet therye ire still not really convinced of the diagnosis because there is multiple problems and they have not ruled out there i some of the other things youad he c he just knew how to get around anything 

Recording: (7727/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (7728/ 8002) 
it is the grocery we use it yeah 

Recording: (7729/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7730/ 8002) 
almost all the parents did 

Recording: (7731/ 8002) 
okay well that is a good job i mean because he a a good flextime yeah it wass 

Recording: (7732/ 8002) 
yeah it it is as 

Recording: (7733/ 8002) 
was working out there 

Recording: (7734/ 8002) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (7735/ 8002) 
helps the cur < 

Recording: (7736/ 8002) 
umhum sure 

Recording: (7737/ 8002) 
no that is one thing that i you know i found was really lacking here um for my son uh 

Recording: (7738/ 8002) 
i mean obviously being uh being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (7739/ 8002) 
he is really just yeah he does not think through the implications that things real well in his personal life 

Recording: (7740/ 8002) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (7741/ 8002) 
yeah jacon and and  and i went together 

Recording: (7742/ 8002) 
eah you even got these uh stunt guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (7743/ 8002) 
hat does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like e say it just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (7744/ 8002) 
see that there again the business outboxks the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another try to understand your neighbor more and spending time getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and wit will be nothing and your investment is gone 

Recording: (7745/ 8002) 
oh she is cute she really is really cute i mean mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheaks 

Recording: (7746/ 8002) 
lumpus needs that as much as people do not want other things to clothes i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (7747/ 8002) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food< 

Recording: (7748/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7749/ 8002) 
likei to me that was very strange 

Recording: (7750/ 8002) 
t is alway is going to be somebody it can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality and do a count because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of sup or something and boil water makes some toast but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean itit is individuality again so 

Recording: (7751/ 8002) 
yeah it is weird they o yeah this micerophone is a little bit different so 

Recording: (7752/ 8002) 
yes< 

Recording: (7753/ 8002) 
love < 

Recording: (7754/ 8002) 
umhum it i  it is at the same building actually it is it is that it is used for different things 

Recording: (7755/ 8002) 
know i mean the money you know the money is great you know find it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offer the sundey before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as ar as because the signding bon is was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that yous start down at the hospital as e janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to mainke campus you whould make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and than they did ther raise and they want ad eighty cent hat the hospitaln tha dollar on mainke campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are thefinitely a separat budget you know the  hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they are thirty five million in the hole because they ave auterwas you east and all this but you know it is not the union is fougt that they are ran out they are contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the interance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody that hase any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten and the nation or whatever is far as but they are not woll n the pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always going the have to have people here tot because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finishe before they have ritten up the work order 

Recording: (7756/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7757/ 8002) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (7758/ 8002) 
um i mean i feel i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human right side was that if they are you know on cokan or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (7759/ 8002) 
because hee well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talke about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (7760/ 8002) 
yah now that is okay i you know i do not i just do not want ta touch it i just 

Recording: (7761/ 8002) 
the reds and indians 

Recording: (7762/ 8002) 
thit wis probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (7763/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (7764/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7765/ 8002) 
we needed that 

Recording: (7766/ 8002) 
yeah and he says he knows vms as well but he does not like to do it so he does not do it  and 

Recording: (7767/ 8002) 
then you get the shooting out in honnl lile and the next day there is another one it is just kind of like that sundrum you know well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever um i mean i am not saying not to cover it but yeah and then course you have the whole gun control stuff that is just ridiculous 

Recording: (7768/ 8002) 
but my son he just he is so um i mean i do not know if you have ever met anybody that is totally into politics 

Recording: (7769/ 8002)

Recording: (7779/ 8002)

Recording: (7796/ 8002) 
yeah because it is the midwest yeah 

Recording: (7797/ 8002) 
umhum i am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere along line  they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps it would not be a long term and they would know that i would not be long term but that is that intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not the make the high bucks but  what he is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bringg about the spirituality and tha person that is going ta carry them all through life she is also uh tithing more than tithing probably whit  uh i always uh kid with peope i sat the author a said ten percent tithing knew imflation he newgree about economics ten percent anis ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we talke about you can a maces uh littl further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and ta an german and so forth and uh boy you know  takeing h page outo the old bible are not they we do not <

Recording: (7806/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7807/ 8002) 
yeah like they all get the option but i i understand very few exercise it so you know if they were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are not using and then give them the two dollars an hour you know but but then that could then you could say that ois yu is helping to keep people down and so you have to still it is it is an od balance there it is and liket something like that does not seem too skilled to me so i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but obviously 

Recording: (7808/ 8002) 
yeah it is russia in the yeurl mountains no not < i do not even know wher that is that is pretty terrible but i do not think it is <

Recording: (7811/ 8002) 
right oh and i a and i am sure it will especially when you already recognize that you know that if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you are going to be helping along it is a lot easier than trying to figure all what is going on here you know 

Recording: (7812/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7813/ 8002)

Recording: (7835/ 8002) 
ere limited very limited 

Recording: (7836/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7837/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7838/ 8002) 
i think it is good and uh i you know i think women are are capable of doing that my only disagreement with it is that i would have a real problem being in that box hole and have a woman beside me and uh if she gets shot you kno not know how i could deal with that it ould bei men i do not know if you you you women had you know different feelings abut with about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other uh then they do with women everything and they tend to be more protective 

Recording: (7839/ 8002) 
it is an iland but i plan it together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space and i doi an even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the storie s do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things i in you know good old special effects um but uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh bilana and tom whit i do not like that at all 

Recording: (7840/ 8002) 
i honestly do not think that that really has much to do with it obviously it does put the idea in the kid is heads but it is been there for a long time 

Recording: (7841/ 8002) 
better than that much dirt < so uh whenever they we heard any firing like thit was coming toward us why we would head for that hole 

Recording: (7842/ 8002) 
i want i do not want somebody i i want them to be able to feel like they can punish them and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (7843/ 8002) 
yeah so 

Recording: (7844/ 8002)

Recording: (7850/ 8002) 
i can not imagine that it would i mean i am sure brisill would have been a even more different experience but i think it was more just a resentment for sort of everything about america and what what they are fead it was a real love hate relationship 

Recording: (7851/ 8002) 
uh if it was a class i knew i had to take i did not really want to that is what you do uh you just get through it uh

Recording: (7947/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (7948/ 8002) 
yeah yeah we probably eventually will do that but i am like sow up in the air about what i want to do and there is so many things to do out there that i need to take time to think about it 

Recording: (7949/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7950/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7951/ 8002) 
well at the time they ware having a lot of trouble at the school and they just want to get rid of some people w 

Recording: (7952/ 8002) 
oh yeah almost always it does not matter what um the disability is and i do not know why this is but they used to say eight to one now they are saying more like five to one it does not matter if it is a speech impediment blind ness retardation throu apalzy defness learning to you name it there is five to one more boys than there are girls and we do not know why 

Recording: (7953/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7954/ 8002) 
yeah now if you the the the thing tou do is if you know the call sign 

Recording: (7955/ 8002) 
waterto waterberry 

Recording: (7956/ 8002) 
have you ever met somebody liked that ay 

Recording: (7957/ 8002)

Recording: (7959/ 8002) 
um a lot of good investments a lot of saving a lot of living well below means and owning six business is < yeah um his definition of retired is basically um he does not have to work he does but he does not have to so he just finished up a temp job up at uh questy i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now 

Recording: (7960/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7961/ 8002) 
ye they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in thi sen anunseen i will never forget it because i have recyted it for god knows how many years but when you talke to them about posession when you talked to them about demons or spirits they freek out 

Recording: (7962/ 8002) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh jon kennedy died 

Recording: (7963/ 8002) 
yeah it was a home made bow and arrow 

Recording: (7964/ 8002) 
umhum umhum it uh y i i was like  sae i sa she prbably probably thinks the same way now she would been here you know t having trouble with boys and everything you know when she wis growing up u not pabi would uh could have probably when hae been an ass of bu that kind of stuff depending on what how bad they were you know they  laied a hand on herof of course you know but but uh buh but by her being away you know then tend her mom is got her cool head on her houlder she would not let that haveem iunles she told me about it and she would be probably be afraid to tellng me that they would catch an airplaning flight dow over there so you k now tookd the guy up or sometthm

it is ha art school 

Recording: (7967/ 8002) 
i have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (7968/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (7969/ 8002) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with ta with a bigger city when you get more people are is obviously going to be some more problems um i i mean that is really that is really all that i know itis it is obviously a lot more bulled up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (7970/ 8002) 
hum 

Recording: (7971/ 8002) 
alkay so umm christ and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got it in my head that i did not want anybody to call and say how is your dad doing and so the best way to dea with that situation wis to call a globaly across the board plus it was a fun csychological experiment just as as they go because how often dod you get to tell people a kill himself this morning so i i i hi i yo do i i no i have not talkd toyou n a little hie with everything o okay i actually know my my father kiled himself this morning you are kidding so you you end up after dolsing yourso people narrowing it down you have got you are kidding you are not serious no

Recording: (7975/ 8002) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they wil not allow dogs so < she is not allowed to go over there bso she is always a bu but it does make a big difference so i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (7976/ 8002) 
um as far as my brother goes i can not say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town um but usually is either at work because he works full time then he has he is a part time student an columba state um so i do not really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out and does his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but it i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that 

Recording: (7977/ 8002) 
wel wel yeah we librarians traditionally have problems with it is like a form of senswership you know big brother things lipebraryians i have i always had problems with that um i i do not know it is it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know ow to balance it 

Recording: (7978/ 8002) 
throw nirs balls in the audience and < 

Recording: (7979/ 8002) 
as to what the sang wr  shoul be like <  so we had a tour uh the quir took at tour our quire drector uh arrang tit to about six five or six churches ad in the columbus area to sing in hem and  not for an audience but just tjo sing and this see which ones wed like the cook tik of and uh that was interesting we sang and uh we sang in he central presbi tary an churh shou dwn town which is where this my one of my orchestras plas a lot and uh we sang in other different kind of hurches and said what we like about ind what we did no  maybe it had some weet back i think thut new building it is a coustically very good it is certainly much better than old weare cp center be cause idndo not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worchip center it was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quotean quote type building in nineteen sixty two and it is yeah it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle that has nothing in it just it is just empty space over the over the worchip center so when you would sing in that is a cir spread out a long the front if you were under the high place your voice we would go all  the way to the back  but if you were under this flat ceiling it is only about seven or thte is only about nine or ten feet high it was dead it was  muffle  and uh it was terrible oticly  but you know we mad do with it for many years and then uh  and then we had the chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is a it is really beautiful it is a circular almost cyrcular big uh it ispace with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh  it is it is nice  well you could still go it is they will not have they will not have a lot of uh

Recording: (7987/ 8002) 
n that that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people goo nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game
