Recording: (50/ 10721) 
it is all to a human being if they want to change if they got their mind set on they do not want to be with you know their other sex i do not think you can change you know that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (51/ 10721) 
oh well we really want to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was the and when he was fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go so we will probably end up there sometime but after i have been to school and after he works for a little while and i work in so that we can have a my i mean i mean we do not need to have the time but we just should be at least a little out of debt  yeah something 

Recording: (52/ 10721) 
yeah i know oh the disney christmas it is such a shame 

Recording: (53/ 10721) 
something like that i do not i do not know much about it 

Recording: (54/ 10721) 
and it is if you know any teenagers it is more strict you make it more they rebel 

Recording: (55/ 10721) 
with that situation 

Recording: (56/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (57/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (58/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (59/ 10721) 
you know i was sitting down uh in my boyfriend is room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone i had my computer on but nobody was sitting at it 

Recording: (60/ 10721) 
so i you know they pile hey you resemble that remark you know 

Recording: (61/ 10721) 
for me to even think about  

Recording: (62/ 10721) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like about black ass and all this you know they are prejudice and all she is doing is yelling about being they are prejudice against her because what she is doing with her hand and i am job 

Recording: (63/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (64/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (65/ 10721) 
the ultimate would probably be a part time thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time we are we have some friends that do that we are they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both so 

Recording: (66/ 10721) 
except for their names were changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (67/ 10721) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special certificate you are certified kindergarten through twelve so i did several years in the high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary well kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that 

Recording: (68/ 10721) 
they have always been there i mean you know i do not really care what the uh guy is specific thing is if he is in a box hole with me you know and you shoot a gun  you know i mean i could care well i have got gay friends you know so 

Recording: (69/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (70/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (71/ 10721) 
it really is  it really is great 

Recording: (72/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (73/ 10721) 
they will be naked but they will still go in with a huge talent 

Recording: (74/ 10721) 
i mean uh like uh what is his name the who wrote the book you just 

Recording: (75/ 10721) 
which could change 

Recording: (76/ 10721) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (77/ 10721) 
i have not taken him that yet 

Recording: (78/ 10721) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation that you can be converted to homosexuality and i personally do not believe that so it i you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this comes comes from but since i think they are wrong  i 

Recording: (79/ 10721) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (80/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (81/ 10721) 
but i am using me in the example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me wrong 

Recording: (82/ 10721) 
yeah he 

Recording: (83/ 10721) 
i just did not want to do that a lot of people do that but you know it is just such an investment and when you leave and 

Recording: (84/ 10721) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i i do not even know because to it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together that has to because it is going to be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about alien this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is just 

Recording: (85/ 10721) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (86/ 10721) 
her house in india is like this mansion in the half servants there i mean it is really impressive just the house is just worth more so you can not get as much out here but yeah everybody is doing well 

Recording: (87/ 10721) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (88/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (89/ 10721) 
that is fine 

Recording: (90/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (91/ 10721) 
not as an individual uh well see that is a problem i have it is hard to find a balance between censorship and you know free flow of information um and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running which i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while i get that that is kind of interesting to watch these people uh but 

Recording: (92/ 10721) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (93/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (94/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 10721) 
that is i can not it was not it is not in a movie well there we go 

Recording: (96/ 10721) 
but you do not really have to work because are there apparently 

Recording: (97/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (98/ 10721) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me umhum they look at like well my my friend is has to do it and say well i know i have to do it you know they look at it like it is a big pain because i got to run over to the nurse and 

Recording: (99/ 10721) 
you do not you do not use coupons 

Recording: (100/ 10721) 
and apparently that is the way of finishing our conversation um one of the guys i usually go clubbing with he is the one that got me into the low stick dancing and he said uh he said there is like a sign that says come hit on me and i am like oh great that is that is just what i need that does not bother me does not bother me i just i just i sort of just i am just like now you know i am great if they start if they start getting really you know really push you about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is really funny because i will get in a conversation with them and they will be like you are straight are not you i am like yeah 

Recording: (101/ 10721) 
and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were i i mean he is neither and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that 

Recording: (102/ 10721) 
uh i blew a disk out 

Recording: (103/ 10721) 
oh not very right and i twenty twenty years first twenty years i worked at the bureau i was worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they are misinterested and my wife does has been the director of institutional research at the university um data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there um 

Recording: (104/ 10721) 
like not go out  you are pretty much your tv is your entertainment for the year 

Recording: (105/ 10721) 
that it is still really going on you know and his parents accepted him 

Recording: (106/ 10721)

Recording: (110/ 10721) 
i am not sure it is usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i do not know 

Recording: (111/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (112/ 10721) 
go ahead and she well now sometime she will ask us i am not if she does but let us assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and so forth she puts them right and then let us think uh with those other dishes makes no effort to clean them and and i i i have seen this in many many many incidents but i am giving you this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society 

Recording: (113/ 10721) 
i was thinking of grandchildren 

Recording: (114/ 10721) 
i think he is in prison and um he has no driver is license privileges for life and you know it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff 

Recording: (115/ 10721) 
every time i found myself it was up it is a nice feature sorry i will stop go ahead  does not matter when i clear my throat and you are listening to it and it is going to be annoying yeah my apologize is in advance 

Recording: (116/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (117/ 10721) 
with your children of light 

Recording: (118/ 10721)

Recording: (119/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (120/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (121/ 10721) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (122/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (123/ 10721) 
but you know that thereing goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean obviously this pork it you know apparently was so miserable on his life that he was going downstairs and the even to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his noriega or whatever you know and uh and his parents did not have a clue who or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (124/ 10721) 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um uh i think there is something else in the bible where you know she the lady gives gives only a small hum worse and compared to large fortune but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need to promote more of that if we are going pack things and materialized we need to think more of that but i think really too late what would you be doing up here third world country and do you have choice 

Recording: (125/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (126/ 10721) 
not right now i am kind of job motivated 

Recording: (127/ 10721) 
satisfor 

Recording: (128/ 10721) 
uh it is 

Recording: (129/ 10721) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had absolutely they would lock you in the closet throw at a key and we let you out most of the parents i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids with a stepparent

Recording: (131/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (134/ 10721)

Recording: (136/ 10721) 
and i think it was an article this last wednesday in the wanted to how the piece still can not regulate it and because that they want to deregulate telecommunications uh and so for the past months we have not been getting telephone bills for usage we had the back when we are paying for it and what is going to happen all this whole thing is it offers us a a a lot of that to where to where the we can now uh if we have a contractor let us say over 

Recording: (137/ 10721) 
my personally do not believe they should be allowed to because i believe they they should have the no wonder as well as the you know wonder for a proper premium

almost many emission film but the families living with the animals in the same house and you try to understand and and you will never they will never get away from howeverty and the classes in our society that is just life is always going to be that but the thing is try to have understanding compassion for them and try to reach out and sometimes the people do not want either and sometimes you see well now i know why they do not want to because they do not know they would not know how to handle it they appreciate the thought 

Recording: (146/ 10721)

but the federal government and their lawyers have done that and the department of the interior still considered native americans on the same level as a dog they do not have rights something wrong there and that still goes on a day after about six hundred years and we have got good people in this country that want to do something about it but unfortunately you know what i am finding you you got everybody is got to choose their path 

Recording: (186/ 10721) 
umhum and where do you draw the line what people should see and not see i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i can see something or time i mean when my kids can see uh that is my job and if i do not want to see something on tv i will turn it off if i do not want my kids to see something on tv we will have an argument but it used to be even they were little you know now yeah 

Recording: (187/ 10721) 
hecleans the toilet too because he is a boy and boys even some men do not quite 

Recording: (188/ 10721) 
most of them are still suddenly just sitting there following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (189/ 10721) 
i think you do that here  

Recording: (190/ 10721) 
i makes it hard like if you got like if like you and you got a family you know you know you take you if you want to you want to like spend an eye on the town with your you know with your family man that is that kind of blows your whole budget for the year 

Recording: (191/ 10721) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (192/ 10721) 
so uh he finally decided uh you know after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway you know 

Recording: (193/ 10721) 
and i could not walk at all 

Recording: (194/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (195/ 10721) 
she does not have any kids and she works and he works so everybody does pretty good now 

Recording: (196/ 10721) 
and we kind of hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they have not and everybody is changing and especially the younger people and uh we were not ready and we did not change fast enough we did not get ready for the change that was coming 

Recording: (197/ 10721) 
like pheasians okay 

Recording: (198/ 10721) 
and what the question really says instead of what do you think it says so that you will not be testing his reading ability but you will really be testing whether he knows about magnetism 

Recording: (199/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (200/ 10721) 
which they have to 

Recording: (201/ 10721) 
i think it is because parents are at work and they are busy making money and they are not teaching their kids any i mean they are not teaching them to say thank you and please and just a normal you know um thanks for having me when you go to someone is house just the normal i can not tell you how many kids i have picked up and driven home when i picked up my uh and because it was raining or something they just jump out of the car and go bye close the door i turned to my son and i go do not you ever do that to someone is mother now how bad 

Recording: (202/ 10721) 
it is these uh that has a set up where um they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (203/ 10721) 
i mean you do not know anything behind it or what is going into it why would you do something like that 

Recording: (204/ 10721) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (205/ 10721) 
so we had a lot of time together and she said she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (206/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (207/ 10721) 
for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents uh i would almost give you a first hand example uh i just had a uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandfather is house and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it 

Recording: (208/ 10721) 
no i 

Recording: (209/ 10721) 
oh blue eye that is right  umhum 

Recording: (210/ 10721) 
where 

Recording: (211/ 10721) 
for their behavior because if they were an ass hole before their brain injury they are going to be an ass hole after their brain injury five times 

Recording: (212/ 10721) 
uh to we never use the word ever  but um i am sure play a people use the word on us you know but we try we shared everything that we had and supposedly we uh sharing but um in 

Recording: (213/ 10721) 
oh yeah we are members of there 

Recording: (214/ 10721) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (215/ 10721) 
nothing about or or if they did they did not even think anything about and i do not think that behavior is uh appropriate for a sixteen seventeen year old kid hm 

Recording: (216/ 10721) 
just a little hard to accept um you know and it is it is it is hard to know what he is going through how much of it is uh normal teenage rebellion and how much of it is 

Recording: (217/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (218/ 10721) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (219/ 10721) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they obviously they are gonna get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parents fault i mean i there are a lot of people i mean i think just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting that happened a couple years ago and they just came to a verdict on it and the parent like left it in the top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and ended up shooting himself with it 

Recording: (220/ 10721) 
it took us ten years to have you know i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the subtle age were told under tones you know is she or is not she all it is just like well i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that was an oh no to her that i was not but you need to know that 

Recording: (221/ 10721) 
so they got more by by him power if they got there okay 

Recording: (222/ 10721) 
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now and then um i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to uh the cafeteria for example they can put all you can folk master you can do all this superficial stuff on a thing to make got more attracted and they do every every religion that makes it more attracted for it oh i was using what is covered for them well yeah but the bottom line is 

Recording: (223/ 10721) 
infantry men around there and so uh we started looking around for a place to lay in i mean cut our bedrooms out so on and the next morning i do not know i guess i was looking for uh somebody that had a fire there warmup some some a race or something anyway one of the first guys i saw was the guy that i worked with my wife in the office there 

Recording: (224/ 10721) 
well i have been yeah i was not much i my being here and my daughter being here i did not really have the uh time with her that i wished i would have had you know but uh uh from other you know did they all right and everything but i always thought i would have been more involved in their growing up and i think two people families is are generally better you know or not necessarily living and being a lot you know being married and everything but 

Recording: (225/ 10721) 
of a particular uh facility voice and data 

Recording: (226/ 10721) 
uh i am originally from indiana but i lived up in uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleveland center which is an air route traffic center um a small center and i moved from there to ohio state airport and i worked there for nineteen years and uh then i transferred to port columbus 

Recording: (227/ 10721) 
doug trees and stuff like that yeah it is real it is more not all of a centralized downtown it is more of a like spread out 

Recording: (228/ 10721) 
yeah we um we have two computers in our house and they both have internet on them and um it is called all advantage and they will pay you to go to web sites and like twenty five cents an hour or something i do not remember what it was but we have not got a check yet but  

Recording: (229/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (230/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (231/ 10721) 
i know ten oclock in the morning i do not care and there is no compromise with him 

Recording: (232/ 10721) 
yeah they are very quantity of it as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all bottom line in the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like this this and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well in my opinion though i am not losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover and things like that then and if you have a product that 

Recording: (233/ 10721) 
it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was which was which great for me i mean everybody my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom and i would do fun stuff and then and and i do not i never remember it being negative 

Recording: (234/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (235/ 10721) 
i worked for a company called high lights for children 

Recording: (236/ 10721) 
um so i think that part definitely helps where as most of my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um or like i said i have already done all the stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (237/ 10721) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you  yeah 

Recording: (238/ 10721) 
they did not they did not bring out uh he only gave ten cents 

Recording: (239/ 10721) 
youngest 

Recording: (240/ 10721) 
sure 

Recording: (241/ 10721) 
right yeah 

Recording: (242/ 10721) 
would like to be treated 

Recording: (243/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (244/ 10721) 
i do not know i mean and it was my money so why should it matter 

Recording: (245/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (246/ 10721) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (247/ 10721) 
uh i do not think i would want my kid to go to day care crazy  

Recording: (248/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (249/ 10721) 
we do not do that here and i said but i noticed you know uh there is a lot of black population here or uh creo mix and that type of uh which i would consider colored not black uh to me black is black if you have anything mixed in your it is colored uh but he said uh we do not do that uh he said probably in the states kind of you guys kind of tell anyone is who wants a car again 

Recording: (250/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (251/ 10721) 
absolutely 

Recording: (252/ 10721) 
that is it 

Recording: (253/ 10721) 
umhum right 

Recording: (254/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (255/ 10721) 
you know that is a possibility you do not you are you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you because you know the the word has to get out that we do not have that much money  it does not pay  yeah 

Recording: (256/ 10721) 
for like summer project or something 

Recording: (257/ 10721) 
so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figure that would be a decent i mean it translates over because we are in semesters it will get all messed up there but it it is it is like i am halfway to three fourths done with a with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now it would be like after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits will not transfer over it would be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half 

Recording: (258/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (259/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (260/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (261/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (262/ 10721) 
even in the package of information 

Recording: (263/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (264/ 10721) 
but i have been in situations where people have told racist jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny please do not tell them anymore in my presence do what you want when you are with your other friends but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blonde jokes i find those sexist and racist in a way and i i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working and in an office they 

Recording: (265/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (266/ 10721) 
people want a number they do not want to know the methodology that goes in to it or the the disclaimers of footnotes they do not want to read the footnotes they want a number uh when i worked for the state one program i worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas of uh my uh which actually is originally started here at the university in ohio it was a federal program department labor it was minnesota state level and 

Recording: (267/ 10721) 
white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is it is not so much money that it would radical change your life in a sort of 

Recording: (268/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (269/ 10721) 
it is up to him to resolve it 

Recording: (270/ 10721) 
but she does not believe it  yeah yeah she is very pregnant umhum yeah she yeah she could probably 

Recording: (271/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (272/ 10721) 
crime 

Recording: (273/ 10721) 
if you have specific questions we are never going to get to them 

Recording: (274/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (275/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (276/ 10721) 
uh like because there is not like uh like a like a fine lead lead person because it is just one person doing it and most of the time i mean like people do have groups that play like technical beat or but it is not like i will be the singer who like you know it is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (277/ 10721) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do i mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an extravagant or who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then the other people uh 

Recording: (278/ 10721) 
like you are doing interviews 

Recording: (279/ 10721) 
so um national tax dollars also get foreign state tuition 

Recording: (280/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (281/ 10721) 
yeah yeah  and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it  but if you are played at me you know six times in three hours  

Recording: (282/ 10721) 
yeah i will explain that to them 

Recording: (283/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (284/ 10721) 
yeah the me exposure  the me exposure  

Recording: (285/ 10721) 
just people coming from high street and just happened happened to be centralized right there on both sides of the avenue 

Recording: (286/ 10721) 
in the world 

Recording: (287/ 10721) 
 you know 

Recording: (288/ 10721) 
yeah it was it is not bothering me but when i talk and move my head 

Recording: (289/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (290/ 10721) 
i like the social aspects that are the problem so 

Recording: (291/ 10721) 
um yeah pretty good for secretarial administrative type work i mean everybody is always looking for that 

Recording: (292/ 10721) 
oh yeah well i do not know  

Recording: (293/ 10721) 
what we are animals 

Recording: (294/ 10721) 
on your own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that there is other 

Recording: (295/ 10721) 
whatever you know and uh you know he is pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because uh i was right 

Recording: (296/ 10721) 
they get caught with that stuff or him and nothing happens and it just that is just a horrible example that here you have got you know some regular some eighteen year old kids that this is really but and he is ten years in jail and then you have got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can he can left it you know and you just it is just it is so stead of wrong  

Recording: (297/ 10721) 
to come in and they keep with our neighbors like years ago you knew everybody in in town well the town i grew up in was some station and i do not know if you are that old ten any town or not but it is in our big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (298/ 10721) 
hi johnny bye 

Recording: (299/ 10721) 
and then it is different businesses like white castle or pizza one of the pizza places and uh some of the supermarkets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to uncle berry house and they do not have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know group of volunteers that go out and pick these kids up take them to hucklebury house which 

Recording: (300/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (301/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (302/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (303/ 10721) 
what you are making because you know if you believe in religion you are here temporarily for an attorney later on you know 

Recording: (304/ 10721) 
but i think computers is going to really dominate 

Recording: (305/ 10721) 
well we we went in at napers 

Recording: (306/ 10721)

Recording: (307/ 10721) 
i do not know anything about it but he he lived in um poke which is um i think it is near santa barbara but we have talked about la i do not know anything i have heard terrible things about it but  

Recording: (308/ 10721) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game and then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora you know a hat he looked so cool you know because showp at turner he always wears a tie i do not know he just he he is a great coach 

Recording: (309/ 10721) 
the um i said i did not belong to any groups and that is not true i belong to ohio design or craftsman and um uh they in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio artists but the membership is is national so uh it is not it is not really closed it is just hum 

Recording: (310/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (311/ 10721) 
well there were five of us and  a lot of that 

Recording: (312/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (313/ 10721) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money in high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably going to stay because it is really easy life 

Recording: (314/ 10721) 
uh but see his father lived right around the corner and never even had nothing to do with them 

Recording: (315/ 10721)

Recording: (446/ 10721) 
the word will far less agricultural related uh we are for more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation uh so uh a man uh man or what my main phrase a woman can do most of the work as being done outside of the home today versus what they what i have done as agricultural people uh and once again though that would bring people back 

Recording: (447/ 10721) 
walks away 

Recording: (448/ 10721) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least let us us know what is going on in the rest of the world and and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that as you increase your knowledge you are far better off than to stay in this little hole where you are this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (449/ 10721) 
i asked machine the next day it says my mother is decide to accept you are offer and i thought well i do not want to do that so i ended up talking to him and i i just it went to him that um he had caught me off guard and that i would had more time to reconsider it and that because it and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me he was a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it

your mind you are going to have your mind open to receive what your eyes near  uh you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school but there is a lot of things you are just not going to learn except by actual experience and living life and i believe that that is a lot of whatever i know i started to say a while ago and i do not think i finished it i myself have these ones getting only what i need versus 

Recording: (454/ 10721)

yeah and geometry and and trigger and uh physics and a little smattering of everything and uh i bet i could not pass the i bet i could not pass the math without some instruction but my son did not pass the writing party past the everything but the writing part and the writing part they ask you to write two five paragraph essay and they give you these topics and you can pick from them and you have to do it right there and

Recording: (512/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (513/ 10721) 
they tried sampling well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (514/ 10721)

Recording: (515/ 10721) 
yes i do i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (516/ 10721) 
yeah yeah that is very true 

Recording: (517/ 10721) 
uh girlfriend works for health insurance and mary kay 

Recording: (518/ 10721) 
they they go out there and there is a i suppose in a county seat town and they flail a claim on a certain area of a land uh it was surveyed off and marked off in sections a section of land as uh six hundred and forty acres that sounds like a lot of it is a good size area 

Recording: (519/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (520/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (521/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (522/ 10721) 
oh yeah i am sure 

Recording: (523/ 10721) 
and i think that uh the morals being you know especially at a young age you know abstinence is the best policy so many people i i i think they are turning to they are not going to have any thing  do anything before they are married um but in today is life once you get into college and stuff it is a little hard to but i think a lot more kids are going that route um because my parents never talked to me about sex we all learn it from our friends um 

Recording: (524/ 10721) 
oh they really 

Recording: (525/ 10721) 
but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (526/ 10721) 
uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so 

Recording: (527/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (528/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (529/ 10721) 
i think it was a a nice thing about what we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicate with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasize the fact that uh uh you know kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (530/ 10721) 
what department 

Recording: (531/ 10721) 
you know about seventy thousand dollars and uh um it was just a hard decision to make you know because if uh you know a a lot more should have come from that i mean uh joking around you know i saw that adam steeler movie and big daddy he got his foot run over by a cab and there was a right in there pardon me where he says uh well i got my foot run over my cab and that cab was huge and a jury decided that 

Recording: (532/ 10721) 
i do not think it is really i do not think it is really affected me i mean obviously there is more places because shopping or to eat or there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (533/ 10721) 
well i think sometimes it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never oh my kids not to do something that i myself was doing example smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my different they know you are not a possibly up but i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age somebody can not at another age possibly like go out on a beat for example well who is going 

Recording: (534/ 10721) 
i think that is i i guess i i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be come back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis 

Recording: (535/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (536/ 10721) 
really  

Recording: (537/ 10721) 
but at the same time i mean i do not  dislike them or anything for it i mean it is it is their choice i mean fact of the matter is it does not have any effect or anything so 

Recording: (538/ 10721) 
once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (539/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (540/ 10721) 
it it would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving first of all how much are they earning how much they expect to pay for a house and all these other things you know they they say to you well i will say the temperament church then you got oh gee five dollars here or made twenty cents a twenty cents an hour here you figure all those up all these campaigns you hear during course 

Recording: (541/ 10721) 
i mean i mean that is that is a lot of money for having a good time you know 

Recording: (542/ 10721) 
telling you some people go nuts with the name i worked on a children is hospital when i was in college uh at the ear news and through out patient clinic a couple summers and i am telling you how to put some names on the books like you would not believe iowa garling that was her name iowa garling and there was a little boy named f from um zambal is junior cocacola franklin i am supposed to fit that in a space like that  

Recording: (543/ 10721) 
well i think a few of them have 

Recording: (544/ 10721) 
oh sure yeah 

Recording: (545/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (546/ 10721) 
oh i bet 

Recording: (547/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (548/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (549/ 10721) 
i do not mean kid 

Recording: (550/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (551/ 10721) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is going through who he you know i i went to that where you know you you look at a woman and you are you she is attractive to you you know but that is just something that is going through your mind and i think it is like the double getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do but even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would have just tell him that is something he is going through and 

Recording: (552/ 10721) 
uh you know he is paying rent at his mother uh was not not really his mother and all but her uh so she can right uh he is he has to become more responsible responsible about a lot of things which is getting with the normal matcheration but he is just doing it the hard way 

Recording: (553/ 10721) 
i did not i i did not want to go to school 

Recording: (554/ 10721) 
who had shown support or was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that had not and i had people waiting at a phone bank and i would call them at work or at home and and i do not offer to take them to the polls if you do not have a ride uh we will take you to the polls if you are worried about you know someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and we will babysit for you while you go to vote because i have also read studies that 

Recording: (555/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (556/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (557/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (558/ 10721) 
and if more and more people are getting older and older there will be more of needs for it  i mean a lot of things there is gonna be more need for as people get older 

Recording: (559/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (560/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (561/ 10721) 
and it is not our generation who is curtailing it it is still the uh like our parents generation um 

Recording: (562/ 10721) 
well as it turned out he expected us to play the solos  but we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and uh i thought it came out pretty well i have not according of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset  

Recording: (563/ 10721) 
i think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and you know look all over the place for different plays you look on the screen and it is different you say well i would have done this and this and this but you know down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this you know 

Recording: (564/ 10721) 
and they have excellent 

Recording: (565/ 10721) 
i just actually i was going to send my son to a christian kindergarten but i decided to home school instead so i have been home schooling for kindergarten 

Recording: (566/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (567/ 10721) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (568/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (569/ 10721) 
yeah right yeah we could put a little trailer there we would be outside most of the time anyway so  

Recording: (570/ 10721) 
um yeah people that live there i mean we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and and a couple of asian groceries but i you know i i i do not know where they live i mean it it seems it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (571/ 10721) 
i did i did my pitching but really was not nothing to do about it because you know once they have their word in it they are 

Recording: (572/ 10721) 
that is not my favorite age i guess 

Recording: (573/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (574/ 10721) 
i was taking like you know twenty one twenty three hours a quarter so 

Recording: (575/ 10721) 
and they do not know any different 

Recording: (576/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (577/ 10721) 
yeah they are okay they are parents they are in their seventies now i i take what i need and leave the rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (578/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (579/ 10721) 
yeah it is really expensive but that is why i went there for now i would not go there it was actually my last choice uh for universities but i went there because of the price 

Recording: (580/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (581/ 10721) 
i think that i i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinated things and i know that sounds kind of patty but just um i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (582/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (583/ 10721) 
yeah  to happen you know it up your hand 

Recording: (584/ 10721) 
uh my son when he was in high school had a girl no a little girl friend and she was of let us see he was tenth grade and she she was ninth grade i guess she uh had a baby and uh i believe my son was in eleventh grade when that baby was born and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and uh 

Recording: (585/ 10721) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (586/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (587/ 10721) 
oh exactly i am planning on just staying in the house if i can or whatnot yeah oh yeah yeah i know i mean we are going to get some water and whatnot because you do not know people might turn things off like you said 

Recording: (588/ 10721) 
but people coming from other cities like chicago new york and you know and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites you know they um they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not liked at it you know uh we only had one racial incident when i was in the service uh where it was we were predominantly white uh platoon and uh because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so 

Recording: (589/ 10721) 
he likes meat too 

Recording: (590/ 10721) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised um which classes is in i think this was in the better introduction to the arts class kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard  and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of you know at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at the school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was 

Recording: (591/ 10721) 
for fun we have been playing a lot of pool 

Recording: (592/ 10721) 
neither one of us can remember it so i do not know 

Recording: (593/ 10721) 
because they have done away with uh civil service step raises which were wrong because i could have done a crummy job and got the same raises doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that because you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times given the raises and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (594/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (595/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (596/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (597/ 10721) 
um so i just you know something i was a little familiar with anyway uh i was just looking for something parttime 

Recording: (598/ 10721) 
as long as you uh said i had already i just knew i was going to be getting a notice so because i flunked out like in december you know and uh so in january i had already contracted the navy and the air force uh about getting into they are taking our test and everything and taking their uh physicals uh so yeah well 

Recording: (599/ 10721) 
well my grew up with just my mom there she had four kids and i was a very quiet and did very well in school 

Recording: (600/ 10721) 
and neither one of these folks could answer yes or no and they are going just answer yes or no that is how i think i stayed at my point very clearly when i was and the answer is yes or was it was it was um health care for live in partners um it is a simple question yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that you know and i know that that from a pr standpoint you do not want to you do not want to shown any people away that might vote for you because you feel like the 

Recording: (601/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (602/ 10721) 
train your trash speaking of what movies are playing uh but i do not really rely on it heavily for news 

Recording: (603/ 10721) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (604/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (605/ 10721) 
yes it is definitely having effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i do not know but uh i am glad our children went to school when they did  and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (606/ 10721) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (607/ 10721) 
i talk to her every day 

Recording: (608/ 10721) 
right my husband drops them off and i pick them up so he is there for the shorter amount of time 

Recording: (609/ 10721) 
yeah and we are one of them taxes is just important strong they have like 

Recording: (610/ 10721) 
more respectfully that uh you know i mean most of the people will accept you if you are dressed in a dress whereas i mean even if person in a nose range will will respect you but but then you are in a you are out of disadvantage if you do not  dress in a certain way 

Recording: (611/ 10721) 
put my hand here try to keep it out of the line of the wire 

Recording: (612/ 10721) 
i am i am been impressed i am like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look anything 

Recording: (613/ 10721) 
so uh it is been time for her from sharing to come home popular 

Recording: (614/ 10721) 
they go over well oh we do not care how we are going to do that we are we we just went five guys out there in the court and so forth but we have yeah we are not going yeah you go out oh we lost four we lost one to that makes you a year i do not know why but we got four guys on the that is okay that is divorce that is attitude 

Recording: (615/ 10721) 
like end uh of is all those little words you are already supposed to know those you are supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it is just a little short sentence like my name is joe in i live at buffalo ball street i mean it is incredible it is like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down 

Recording: (616/ 10721) 
got bears 

Recording: (617/ 10721) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so i am i am working for a research firm just for the venience of the hours i i wanna go back into the nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eight hour shift and uh i do not think that we are ready for that yet he is 

Recording: (618/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (619/ 10721) 
that and i imagine that is about half and half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is in evolution at this time to tell you the truth what is going to call the world end i think what they really mean by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will not be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content uh 

Recording: (620/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (621/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (622/ 10721) 
make them a little coffee shop 

Recording: (623/ 10721) 
i have just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (624/ 10721) 
but uh but even so uh we were on this and uh germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us so we we did not go out in the daylight hardly at all 

Recording: (625/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (626/ 10721) 
so hard i mean every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is not f and when uh my you know oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there and once she got into it she went ooh maybe not  so i said well what you know whatever so then she wanted to go because it is basically a columbus public school that is geared to college only i mean if if you are not going to college do not go there because you will flunk out it is very hard 

Recording: (627/ 10721) 
and i am meeting with someone on thursday actually who is in that field it is really just an open field 

Recording: (628/ 10721) 
they will just you know send me into the new millennium or whatever you want to call it  

Recording: (629/ 10721) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or you know something like that you call the contract i will be in thursday you know if your air conditioning so they are always going to have to have people here so i just they are either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have twenty people that half of them know what is going on so but that is tough to do when you are starting people with eight dollars an hour and stuff so but it is you know wendy is mcdonald is there is places that you can make that money 

Recording: (630/ 10721) 
well uh the first the first thing is clintonville 

Recording: (631/ 10721) 
you know oh really no they do not have like your your base the amenities oh my gosh   really uhhuh where 

Recording: (632/ 10721) 
you know i mean i liked earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was a nice is man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that one they fired him the day the for the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (633/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (634/ 10721) 
uhhuh parties did not change at all 

Recording: (635/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (636/ 10721) 
gave me these leading questions and i said uhhuh i know we are coming from and i have been come from that when i was in the high state and so forth and um so i just laid on the line to her sure 

Recording: (637/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (638/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (639/ 10721) 
i i have gone to one but i had a back problem that is how i dealt with it and it worked 

Recording: (640/ 10721) 
yeah high school a lot of people are really narrowminded and work on really trying to fit in college people are a more open idea like been minded and they are more willing to express their own ideas 

Recording: (641/ 10721) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (642/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (643/ 10721) 
a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (644/ 10721) 
be back although now i miss one of them so  

Recording: (645/ 10721) 
that is weird 

Recording: (646/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (647/ 10721) 
the one that is eighteen now i thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four because his dad is left handed my sister is left handed i have one left handed parent well when i was in one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and he is been wrote with his right hand ever since so you really can not tell because they they are pretty much either or until they are about five 

Recording: (648/ 10721) 
yeah which is good for me because i do not ever go there anyway so 

Recording: (649/ 10721) 
um i have a dakota card it what it does is it make it codes the dvd right away rather than sending it through the processor so it is it is a lot faster it does not depend on my process or time like it the movie does not skip or anything it it just goes straight through um yeah well 

Recording: (650/ 10721) 
it is another thing that they are in their own in the house where the parents are every night and not going into the garage and finding things 

Recording: (651/ 10721) 
and uh then well she was out there she met a a cowboy who was from also from a while and uh they uh they were married they were out there i guess but uh she was  uh my son he said that she was a piece of work she she had not 

Recording: (652/ 10721) 
because you got to trust the people you are around you do not really want to piss them off 

Recording: (653/ 10721) 
so they are kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent is kind of how divided out between the projects 

Recording: (654/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (655/ 10721) 
i am going to jump up and start hollering about my face um and and i will not i will not walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i do not feel i am ready to do that yet i think there are a i think there is a place in the time for doing certain things like um and this is this is one of the biggest um things that people use as as a reason for faith 

Recording: (656/ 10721) 
i do not think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it is just too long uh people start turning out and there is only so much you can say it is like the candidates 

Recording: (657/ 10721) 
yeah you are you yeah you may be right could be could be 

Recording: (658/ 10721) 
that is the afternoon yeah okay i have now dover and a ferry what else do i need to remember 

Recording: (659/ 10721) 
not at all 

Recording: (660/ 10721) 
yeah i think it is of course we were fiddling with that so much 

Recording: (661/ 10721) 
all right well i was born in columbia i am twenty seven uh graduated from high state 

Recording: (662/ 10721) 
um aids being one of them 

Recording: (663/ 10721) 
she would pamper the kids and well from where we live to we live just all i do not know whether you are acquainted with northand of plumber and anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfare and uh we lived about a a block on a half off of indianola and then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drug store and a farmers shop 

Recording: (664/ 10721) 
give us a job sure 

Recording: (665/ 10721) 
where you can do for them uh and that all applies to the polarist question as i see it and i think also that uh it is it is a very very major financial uh gain for the developer who are doing that and it is going to therefore harm uh the many many areas is just that affected such as north north north north north  what is the name of the shop uh north by north and 

Recording: (666/ 10721) 
yeah make their job earlier and faster uh you know in library uh some of the other places especially universities or facing budget problems and as subscriptions for periodicals are just outrageous 

Recording: (667/ 10721) 
with my mother umhum  

Recording: (668/ 10721) 
i got a really high iq extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that and i go in to take an exam being back go out and i did not even study for it i think i studied just so much my senior year as i did in my freshman year for one midterm or or one final and uh that just did not work when i got to college but i did not know that until i was done with my freshman year they are with a one point seven gpa about uh about let us see the middle of winter court i 

Recording: (669/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (670/ 10721) 
and um apparently when you are a car um they have a very very like zero tolerance 

Recording: (671/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (672/ 10721) 
getting of some place stable 

Recording: (673/ 10721) 
uh five years ago almost five years ago a couple months short of that oh yeah 

Recording: (674/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (675/ 10721) 
there were six so much born out there 

Recording: (676/ 10721) 
yeah but i mean you know a kid that you know might want to save up or something when he is twelve years old has no chance at all of getting a job 

Recording: (677/ 10721) 
uh i was interested in going out to california and i have been out there several times but it was supposed to be uh why was the line i just did not moving out with my mother 

Recording: (678/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (679/ 10721) 
yeah because uh they are more you always hear about my black ass my you know what i am saying stuff like is and i could give a shit 

Recording: (680/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (681/ 10721) 
yeah see i hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced like one matter 

Recording: (682/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (683/ 10721) 
when they drove by i 

Recording: (684/ 10721) 
she said you know what they say now and i raised my hand and said six she said fourth 

Recording: (685/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (686/ 10721) 
um in general i think i think the united states has a fairly well developed like class not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (687/ 10721) 
and the house smells wonderful you know it is like cakes uh birthday cakes you know i think but my i think my wife was the last one i i make her one and you know we would trade off and i bought a um uh what is that betty crocker at odd lots it was twenty two cents the icing was twenty two cents i made it and everybody goes this is really good it is like a sour cream ice thing and yeah they go boy this is really good and they go did you buy this and i go no i made it and they go really and i go yeah it cost me forty four cents 

Recording: (688/ 10721) 
and uh so 

Recording: (689/ 10721) 
that is that is really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran negatives do not work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in columbus what plays in the state and then the people who ran her campaign ran moyniities campaign and betty montgomery is and that negative stuff worked statewide it does not work so well in columbus um i i think it even a younger woman 

Recording: (690/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (691/ 10721) 
so it is like it is like in the parks you know like you know we like grand canyon you know you can feed them you know you know like junk food and mcdonald is 

Recording: (692/ 10721) 
will do this it will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then my daughter went to school it was just easier to take him to the same school yeah and and that goes back and and it reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and and behavior that would be different in the catholic school is when you are paying big you are paying bucks you know it is four without forty five hundred hours a year for us to send her to school they had three 

Recording: (693/ 10721) 
just pretty much that if you ask for unfor or goodness as granted whatever 

Recording: (694/ 10721) 
um it would a little bit but at the same time i mean it was always a long time ago i mean i do not know how how far in the that has to go for things to be considered a problem with something coming up again um i mean as long as he is not did not have any history of being like an addicted user anything like that i mean i i can not say it really bothers me too much 

Recording: (695/ 10721) 
see that is how my husband was thinking of a pet growing up 

Recording: (696/ 10721) 
um it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it you know we are very strict as far as what they have no you know it is so wild you know when we were kids cowboy and indians everybody had guns everybody you know if you had the best death act you were the the best you know and nowadays oh do not let him have a gun you know do not let him play with you know even a squirt gun you know and so you wonder 

Recording: (697/ 10721) 
actually being able to to recent the funding but still i mean it is a it is we do not like to think about these things happening 

Recording: (698/ 10721) 
is it really 

Recording: (699/ 10721) 
yeah and i i get to argue about stuff there here i am just kind of sitting around

Recording: (714/ 10721) 
like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them you know have bad matters at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrong you know kids and you want them to behave well you know that is how i see them now and america is become more centralized uh and when it deviate from that either way that is when people become upset um i just think it is important i i remember when um who was the other president that i voted for that won carter uh black 

Recording: (715/ 10721) 
well it is kind of hard you would see  he is got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together he does not see at all 

Recording: (716/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (717/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (718/ 10721)

Recording: (722/ 10721) 
psychologist so it took a long time to get to that point but uh so we have been talking to the psychologist about it and they said that she he said most people that are always in that background and he said there you go two different ways ones they they just fall into the same uh pattern as the parents or their survival and she appears to be a survival uh she is never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us uh which i am glad yeah well 

Recording: (723/ 10721) 
and they are not accurate 

Recording: (724/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (725/ 10721) 
yeah it is seventy years old 

Recording: (726/ 10721) 
i i am not really a big fan uh i think one of the big problems is going to be uh uh initially just the uh uh the monetary thing of it you know the people that supported the uh basically supported the uh uh minor league teams that they had here you know it like blue collar people with a you can go for twenty thirty bucks and have a good time get drunk to beer and and up there you know you are not going to be 

Recording: (727/ 10721) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like i think that that is a real strong uh 

Recording: (728/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (729/ 10721) 
one of them some of you come at ten and another group come at ten fifteen and other group and they were all trying to do the same thing at once and it does not work you know you you can not get you can not get so many people through that door and if you say well i am going to take five at a time well they can get in but if you say i am taking five hundred at a time it does not work and so the airplane airlines always go well it is the government and regulations and blah blah blah that is why we are delayed and it is really them themselves because their 

Recording: (730/ 10721) 
i went that went there for career center in high school and that was something that was exciting for me but that is totally all the question for me now because i have a kid and there is no way i would do that

Recording: (733/ 10721) 
um i mean nothing is happened to them and i mean like you said the getting high part of it is not so much of the problem it is just what goes into to it 

Recording: (734/ 10721) 
yeah it is well basically it is like a it is about the size of a very small hotel room and then it is got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub and there is like these are like those are real which is a little box for me while about las vegas that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is enough room where people can come into town there is like a fulled out couch bed for whoever and there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born

uhhuh 

Recording: (738/ 10721) 
yeah i do because some boys might not wear them because they do not have to put them on or i do not know i am not sure because i am not a boy maybe some boys would experience with it before they originally use it you know i am not but i do not think it is it is encouraging them at all at the same time they should be telling them they should not have sex until they are married you know but 

Recording: (739/ 10721) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you want to do or you know and and i guess there is different phases like uh mazda is highericky what is that the uh the higherucky of needs mazda anyway 

Recording: (740/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (741/ 10721) 
and just you know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there was always something different i guess to be outside and there is just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (742/ 10721) 
guns should definitely be kept in a lock box where kids can not get them besides that there is not a whole lot that government can do it is more the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids hands 

Recording: (743/ 10721)

Recording: (758/ 10721) 
and union is not gonna do that 

Recording: (759/ 10721)

Recording: (760/ 10721) 
it was on national news you see i am not that informed on that um 

Recording: (761/ 10721)

Recording: (762/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (763/ 10721) 
 you were passed yeah  

Recording: (764/ 10721) 
no i mean the money you know the money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big step um the reason was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor 

Recording: (765/ 10721) 
well yeah i could have just took them out in the woods and whooped them but what is that going to prove 

Recording: (766/ 10721) 
it does not have to cost anything but you you can go do it with your family or whatever so yeah 

Recording: (767/ 10721) 
you will 

Recording: (768/ 10721)

Recording: (769/ 10721) 
i had that with a the parakeet i had before their life span in the wild was about five years seven years in activity and he was thirteen 

Recording: (770/ 10721)

Recording: (771/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (772/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (773/ 10721) 
why i would not push it on them because that is almost made me be resentful towards being catholic just the fact that i had it forced on me 

Recording: (774/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (775/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (776/ 10721) 
well that is what i am 

Recording: (777/ 10721) 
and uh and that is really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because i uh i i have not said it yet but you you know anyone who is listening to this tape you would be able to know i am a democrat and generally vote democratic although i will i will tell you i i did vote for grig uh shakha once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he has not been for the city but um i am generally a democrat uh and i have only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early 

Recording: (778/ 10721) 
and uh what we would do sometimes when we would get into an area and we would know that we would had a field out here we would be shooting to we would adjust on a target out there we pick uh 

Recording: (779/ 10721) 
you you would not i know right off the bat i would not be able to make as much money as him maybe if i do this college thing i would whack him out of the price range huh 

Recording: (780/ 10721) 
this is the first time in my whole life that i have not been working and it is just like my mom and i go out to lunch and we go to breakfast and we go do so much you do that well it is this is my mom and then amy and i went to lake and then we you know and i actually i we moved about three months ago so i have been kind of doing a lot of stuff at our place so that is nice i mean had a i tend to get everything wallpaper and painted and just do all those kinds of things but it is weird you know because i do not have to get up in the morning and i feel guilty you know he leaves at six thirty or 

Recording: (781/ 10721)

Recording: (785/ 10721) 
do not need to work that many hours with that 

Recording: (786/ 10721) 
no mom we do not want to do that because they do not want to have to be responsible for them at school and wherever 

Recording: (787/ 10721) 
absolutely 

Recording: (788/ 10721) 
and i do have a brother 

Recording: (789/ 10721)

that is sad 

Recording: (791/ 10721) 
i am in 

Recording: (792/ 10721) 
and um both parents work i am not sure if the combine if both parents worked but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no yeah 

Recording: (793/ 10721) 
well the uh worth family and uh the criminals have been around forever you know uh we are just in industries and and the worth family is almost as much uh uh the you got uh i think it is for his duty uh who is like it was a construction guy so uh uh they have been around forever and everything and uh they can get their ways through uh political arena and everything but i think most of the money was uh was private money but they were given like tax 

Recording: (794/ 10721) 
i have had kids that have been like really top notch actors in the school plays it it is just not necessarily a school kind of thing that they are going to be good at but i tried to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently as no reason to think they will not be successful in life mark smith when in olympic gold metal he has a learning disability cherybono can not remember a phone number without transporting to 

Recording: (795/ 10721)

oh okay  

Recording: (799/ 10721) 
she is four months almost five 

Recording: (800/ 10721) 
yeah i do not think that women should be on the front lines uh some women are are physically able to do but needed some definitely are not of course there is a same by the same token some men do not but uh as as support groups i think that is all right 

Recording: (801/ 10721) 
and i am gonna think the owners would be better just because the smaller class size i have like four hundred at my class right now 

Recording: (802/ 10721) 
here less this means i get to hear more of my book 

Recording: (803/ 10721) 
yeah it is a good idea 

Recording: (804/ 10721) 
but then again i feel like sometimes i am so naive i mean a lot of that was not introduced and it was just like well should i have known that 

Recording: (805/ 10721) 
yeah it was real fun real fun i just greatly got him kicked out of the dorm he still does not know what was me but  yeah he still does not know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is fascinating um but uh you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoke pot before i was like no he said hey we got a whole year together and and i am directly quoting that is the first thing he said to me that is the first thing

Recording: (813/ 10721) 
that does 

Recording: (814/ 10721) 
retire yeah 

Recording: (815/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (816/ 10721) 
yeah because i have like a problem with getting to know people you know like uh shy at first 

Recording: (817/ 10721) 
do is they eat out all the time we used to be restaurants i know it they are incredible 

Recording: (818/ 10721)

Recording: (826/ 10721) 
i love that 

Recording: (827/ 10721) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people are getting or staying married because those that do not those that would have gotten the divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and that they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (828/ 10721) 
can not focus or can not attend anything but what is really happening is they attend everything 

Recording: (829/ 10721) 
i wish i would these guys going to military school and so far you can know they have had problems before somewhere along the way whether it is academic or social are you ready to take on this additional responsibility no but we do not promote it again you may we got a set set up with a real we have academics for the oh you are going to be a sport athlete oh then you are we have got we have got different stand at here i am sure they do 

Recording: (830/ 10721) 
go along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (831/ 10721) 
the three r is you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (832/ 10721) 
not willing to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always gonna have to have people here to because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finish before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (833/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (834/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (835/ 10721)

byebye 

Recording: (838/ 10721) 
they like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (839/ 10721) 
yes for attention and uh yeah 

Recording: (840/ 10721) 
there is no doubt in my mind that he heard those voices now whether they were actual automobile voices or whether they were voices from the inside yeah 

Recording: (841/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (842/ 10721) 
yeah and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his own understanding of phoenix and yeah i am i have been pretty impressed i am like wow oh you have got that really really close to being the right spelling  

Recording: (843/ 10721) 
that is right  that is right  it is a parakeet 

Recording: (844/ 10721) 
and misappre heirs but they definitely have thoughts about it and and i think they i think they need to know 

Recording: (845/ 10721) 
yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good 

Recording: (846/ 10721) 
well they do not really give it to them that is the thing is uh i have got i have got some friends that with kids and i see it like on the bus or what the you know when you are working somewhere or not where you people treat their kids you know as a 

Recording: (847/ 10721) 
i do not remember that at all i know how to i know how to do it but i am not sure who taught me how to do it  

Recording: (848/ 10721) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would have voted because i did not think that mike homeman exactly had christma either 

Recording: (849/ 10721) 
no and there is a bunch you go to jail for three years 

Recording: (850/ 10721) 
um not necessarily the catholic beliefs 

Recording: (851/ 10721)

Recording: (852/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (853/ 10721) 
right i did not need to so i did not want to um 

Recording: (854/ 10721) 
not well it is like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you go out and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that then you have somebody else do that part  but i do not do like major gotting or anything i just like to get something that needs that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom kitching and blah blah blah so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (855/ 10721) 
by the way 

Recording: (856/ 10721) 
credit cards 

Recording: (857/ 10721) 
 we 

Recording: (858/ 10721) 
i look like a college student that would go here so i have never had a problem so we go and do that and like we are planning a road ship we we we are not we have not decided we are thinking the atlantic city city or uh florida or new york city or new orleans those situations were trying to narrow a town 

Recording: (859/ 10721) 
thats right there is a well it does not work that 

Recording: (860/ 10721)

the court 

Recording: (866/ 10721)

right well when i was teaching taking teacher education classes here um and observing classroom teachers um they would always tell me you need to give a grade for class participation 

Recording: (904/ 10721) 
uh uh wadsworth which maybe have eighteen thousand uh this kinds of things being developed on the peripheral the cities are just totally destroying those and a consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not do not know our neighbors at all anymore the uh it is quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you 

Recording: (905/ 10721) 
yeah it well we did that too 

Recording: (906/ 10721) 
prodict certain things but they they want everything to be the same they can not be they can not be the same it is just a natural thing but the thing is let them do what they that is what god umhum what you have there kind of nurse and how many refuse a nurse voluntarily that they have children why talking when your women do not why do you have why i do not want to you have the natural ability to give all the all the natural protein the amuseation things 

Recording: (907/ 10721) 
there when bernis was going to school because bernis went uh my older sister went to there is first or maybe second grade out there so she she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever had in grade school but uh then they higher a girl to come in there is a higher girl and uh about the second or third day she was there she was not was not feeling 

Recording: (908/ 10721) 
i mean you kind of suffer your own consequences more rather than having society like yell at you for it 

Recording: (909/ 10721) 
in the elementary school library it is um we focus on sex so much in our society i think and and part of family so sex is such a small part of family life you know i mean it uh especially with the elementary school i mean it is just is is there milk and cookies after school 

Recording: (910/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (911/ 10721)

Recording: (915/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (916/ 10721) 
right i have a neighbor that is at 

Recording: (917/ 10721) 
basically they did not legally adopt him or anything but they are the ones that he considered his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad but it is always kind of a challenge  

Recording: (918/ 10721) 
i went to brookhaven which is uh up on carl road near north and all 

Recording: (919/ 10721)

Recording: (921/ 10721) 
and we could not have class and in addition they were like trying to tip over bosses and throwing stones at them 

Recording: (922/ 10721) 
and just took it and ripped it 

Recording: (923/ 10721) 
well i i work with around mostly black people and it is a weird situation uh there is more prejudice than i am notis now than when it only worked around a couple of them 

Recording: (924/ 10721) 
uh then he killed himself so we never know from there in point why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you know uh from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him making him do it you know 

Recording: (925/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (926/ 10721) 
leaving out stuff man  

Recording: (927/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (928/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (929/ 10721) 
is really opposing my beliefs so i stand there and pretty much star with them about it and usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave 

Recording: (930/ 10721) 
pick charges and at that time i was a little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let them out of the car i will be the best  oh man have said something that i never forget he said i would but that would probably have to be my job to do if we was living like that  i was like god and riding king all over again  

Recording: (931/ 10721) 
is that right 

Recording: (932/ 10721) 
and then we we know where to shift from there to another target 

Recording: (933/ 10721) 
oh maybe i i you know uh because i was you know i was fooling around too when i got ninth grade and i do not know i did not wear any condoms or do anything like that and i just am very lucky for never getting pregnant 

Recording: (934/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (935/ 10721) 
and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with them

Recording: (938/ 10721) 
i feel like uh i have friends and when you say oh we are going out to the bar like we all know which bar because there is only one that college students go to and then so 

Recording: (939/ 10721) 
yeah that that is squirrels looking kind of good or 

Recording: (940/ 10721) 
well you can carry a weapon here in columbus i can carry a weapon right now as long as it is out in the open 

Recording: (941/ 10721) 
what do you mean 

Recording: (942/ 10721) 
we went back to our room and we watched a movie my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer and 

Recording: (943/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah and i have not i have not heard the the rest of the story but um what i have heard i mean in in court he would not have a chance that is no both chance  

Recording: (944/ 10721) 
oh yeah you can not get them off 

Recording: (945/ 10721) 
what did you spend most of your time doing besides snorkeling 

Recording: (946/ 10721) 
i i was raised in the sunday school of the church up here yeah yeah so a long time remember and in fact i think i maybe about the longest i am a member of the choir right now yeah because i sang in the choir there when i was in high school back in nineteen seventy  so it is thirty years ago  yeah yep 

Recording: (947/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (948/ 10721) 
yeah a lot more 

Recording: (949/ 10721) 
you would think but i do not know there has to be something like why you know the first day the that does it i mean after one i am sure others would fall soon after they see the i do not know if it is all that but that first one i do not know 

Recording: (950/ 10721) 
and he had the same thing happened to him he had a scholarship real year and both of his knees are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ball parker are one of the best ones i ever seen and uh rival like a larry bird you know back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a nice car you know never let it get to her 

Recording: (951/ 10721) 
peter is with him once a week and then they come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do that enough for blacks he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say just to to some of my blacks humum friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see the greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said you know that would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not and what you are going to do is you are going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you are going to give people 

Recording: (952/ 10721) 
um i would not know that long 

Recording: (953/ 10721) 
um most of my painting is uh is again so i am funny most of my painting are of uh images from star wars 

Recording: (954/ 10721) 
i do not know uh maybe i think maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more like i mean i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we got to like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff 

Recording: (955/ 10721) 
so i am not going to get any fairness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me the word saying that they sited in their favor and all that crap well you know fine uh but i am not gonna i am not gonna pay them till they contact me again 

Recording: (956/ 10721) 
or had no real relevance to their lives i mean i think the kids would would raleigh immediately the issue right now is that there is nothing there 

Recording: (957/ 10721) 
and it stays with you for years  they do not realize that nobody tells them until after the 

Recording: (958/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (959/ 10721) 
that is it that is what i worry about the large school systems too that is what is concerns me with hell yard you get such a large variety of people compared to like where i was in a smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it is your parents knew their parents yeah your parents knew their parents or their parents knew they you know now you know and i walk to my friend is house and have her friends and if she is going over to play they got to drive them almost because they are they are all around so 

Recording: (960/ 10721) 
uh and she we really like her she is really uh we enjoy being with her but sometimes we go to being with my son uh 

Recording: (961/ 10721) 
i really enjoy one of the things i do not like about living in a big city is is like but i have gotten used to but i i do not like the fact that every time you look up in the night all you see is this like orange haze  you can not see stars very well uh the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every three morning at two thirty in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it is 

Recording: (962/ 10721) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together the only thing that is gonna happen is it is gonna trickle down and you are gonna have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more posit have to have two families that are happy then one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like it is your you know because it is my fault because it is happened you know and i think for me and it was easier that they split up when i was younger than i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um 

Recording: (963/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (964/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (965/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (966/ 10721) 
well like a mile yeah miles down to the south end or something like that but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers   yeah 

Recording: (967/ 10721) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room to all myself you know i do not want to go to some place where i am going to have to so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i got home 

Recording: (968/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (969/ 10721) 
umhum and they should and very rarely do doctors even ask about allergies and i more and more and people do not even realize and they they get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out what is wrong with them because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they have eaten 

Recording: (970/ 10721) 
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (971/ 10721) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior go in the morning and you are senior to go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cruise center and then you go 

Recording: (972/ 10721) 
sure 

Recording: (973/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (974/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (975/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (976/ 10721) 
uhhuh the reds uh more so than indians back my younger days because they were not worth it down but 

Recording: (977/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (978/ 10721) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progressive that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her and actually her brother is a fellow fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know them all that well but apparently her family i mean she is she is double major history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it 

Recording: (979/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (980/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (981/ 10721) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um uh i never i never did it and i you know wish i could have waited until i was married but i you know you are going through that whatever you go through when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people some kids still do that but i think i guess i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (982/ 10721) 
oh i was going to say it would be interesting 

Recording: (983/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (984/ 10721) 
has to be a long standing kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than uh i i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh this is opening the door crack and the next thing you know uh you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gave marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either yeah well 

Recording: (985/ 10721) 
crime is a lot worse now you know on the streets than it used to be 

Recording: (986/ 10721) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (987/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (988/ 10721) 
that is i mean we would be seventy years old when the kid graduated from high school uh and that would not be fair to the kid and and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so we talked about it decided it was not a good idea 

Recording: (989/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (990/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (991/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (992/ 10721) 
but you know you need to get it out of off your chest 

Recording: (993/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (994/ 10721) 
and this one is going to kill you to die so 

Recording: (995/ 10721) 
i have to admit ever when we go to try to play golf sometimes and not have a tee time you can not even get in 

Recording: (996/ 10721) 
they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (997/ 10721) 
because i have heard i have heard stories you know yeah you can either hit the people will say i am like but why  but but it is like yeah if you say it is true i will look into it is that okay because they are getting the real language rather than i think it is uh you you do not learn the language perfectly but if you learn it someone who already does not speak it perfectly then and 

Recording: (998/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (999/ 10721) 
oh my that is goes with the disorder they know they know when who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (1000/ 10721) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people have are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or from the south or something like that so they and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely be meet people born and raising in columbus so 

Recording: (1001/ 10721) 
yeah i did 

Recording: (1002/ 10721) 
yeah but yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (1003/ 10721) 
yeah one more thing to deal with on the other hand it beats it is you know growing up in fifty foster homes or an automobile 

Recording: (1004/ 10721) 
yeah that blocks out all that uh exterior stuff that is trying to pull you away 

Recording: (1005/ 10721) 
you know it got kind of rough to have her here for a couple three weeks out of the or a month or something like that you know during the summer 

Recording: (1006/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1007/ 10721) 
uh it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere in mit my so they are all over uh they have projects all over 

Recording: (1008/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (1009/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1010/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1011/ 10721) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1012/ 10721) 
i am pretty involved i am pretty involved the community the community uh the church is designed as a community of other christians it is not necessarily designed as um i heard this in a service that is really good um it is not designed as a congress comes in and says we 

Recording: (1013/ 10721) 
yeah they are real strict with getting money and bach ideas but yeah 

Recording: (1014/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (1015/ 10721) 
she believes no man will love you so much not to cheat and i do not believe that so i am not with her son  

Recording: (1016/ 10721) 
right and it is all the bucks yeah because people i work with you know uh there there are some people i work with of house payments one guy he has the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a and a lot of them have like fifty hundred and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago and it is like forty five and i would not dare tell them that but it is like you know because they are always you know there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they 

Recording: (1017/ 10721) 
uh wander around to look at things 

Recording: (1018/ 10721) 
i grew up in climas 

Recording: (1019/ 10721) 
yeah but you know 

Recording: (1020/ 10721) 
yeah i i hope to uh at forty nine you know i i have learned a heck of a lot uh a lot of things i would not want to know you know but but i think  i think uh they have been pretty good as long as they you turn them around and and make them a positive statement for you but that is why i would like to have the uh uh a book store just like down around campus you know and people can come in and go over there and relax you know and 

Recording: (1021/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (1022/ 10721)

Recording: (1023/ 10721)

that flipped me out now i could not handle that that i am not ready for that i mean that was crazy she was twenty three the first person i have ever dated is older than me and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like dead serious she was hundred percent sure i was the person she was going to marry and i will see her at church every so often and she will come and give me big hug just like i miss you i am like well i miss you too so not probably the way you miss me but i miss i miss you and you know oh yeah she is in home to tech no  no 

Recording: (1204/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1205/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1206/ 10721) 
no no i like the story um 

Recording: (1207/ 10721) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to think and find that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (1208/ 10721) 
well that is what was going on when i was a you know i mean uh it was just a tried to i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh eleven years old or something like that well they were actually on shooting him and him and uh uh another friend of mine from the same same class you know uh they pulled a gun and shot him you know and he did not know that the damn thing was looked at but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid 

Recording: (1209/ 10721) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transfitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time and uh when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is it is it is exasper eated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (1210/ 10721) 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there is some really really acceptable things going on 

Recording: (1211/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1212/ 10721) 
this is there is there is no faulting the folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative and response to say that experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then and immediately falling off never mind pretend i never said that 

Recording: (1213/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1214/ 10721) 
in case they bought a house or signed in to some kind of contract that they would not be liable 

Recording: (1215/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (1216/ 10721) 
i would get more people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i make in about ten or eleven bucks an hour 

Recording: (1217/ 10721) 
gun control i am not really too interested in i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they are a lot of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they are relatively safe so you mean 

Recording: (1218/ 10721) 
uh it is been should pretty it is uh yeah you know you are not around here is it it is a it is a classic school over on the west side 

Recording: (1219/ 10721) 
yeah which cracks me up because if you have ever looked at the parents of models they are not necessarily all that attractive  

Recording: (1220/ 10721) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go  

Recording: (1221/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1222/ 10721) 
that is that is their job is to spoil them so the poor things i like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground yep 

Recording: (1223/ 10721) 
you know talk to her but uh people do not when i was fourteen i did not care what anybody told me i was gonna do it no matter what 

Recording: (1224/ 10721) 
i think so 

Recording: (1225/ 10721) 
oh yeah and you know i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook red meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups a lot of good soups for them with meat and it really does not bother me to cook it you know i am not going to sit home and make it roast every night 

Recording: (1226/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (1227/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1228/ 10721) 
it is just the the spiritual aspect there is around even einstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematical of our time uh even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yeah but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory 

Recording: (1229/ 10721) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at eight a m well an airport has so many runways and so many tax you ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there at hold while they are you know shooting them in what they do is that 

Recording: (1230/ 10721) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (1231/ 10721) 
yeah that part was no different i mean 

Recording: (1232/ 10721) 
sort of like the definition of need versus luxury uh those definition change the definition of socialism democracy they slowly have changed true with these times well the same thing or true be true with those it is still functioning  excuse me uh um and i think we are also slowly swing our pendulum on back to the and to the family again 

Recording: (1233/ 10721) 
yeah and people do not 

Recording: (1234/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1235/ 10721) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (1236/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1237/ 10721) 
i started this school year off with uh twenty seven kidner gardeners and no aid 

Recording: (1238/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1239/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1240/ 10721) 
uhhuh it does 

Recording: (1241/ 10721) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not think that you can say everything you know you have everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (1242/ 10721) 
after for the whole day which would be considered church so they said i what i had to do was go down to juvenile to the certain julvan and and juvenile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was a school should have did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son is getting ready to go to eleventh grade and 

Recording: (1243/ 10721) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family in fact they have been real unhappy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not liking for anything and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to 

Recording: (1244/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1245/ 10721) 
that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is even though it seems like it is an accident and uh there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is 

Recording: (1246/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1247/ 10721) 
uh it is not really an office he is like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he he tells the the crew members what house was to work on and which ones are ready and and then he gets to um talk with the the other contractors and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites 

Recording: (1248/ 10721) 
you know mixed race or or handicapped or you know hard to place 

Recording: (1249/ 10721) 
or um 

Recording: (1250/ 10721) 
at each other is through for this that and the other and and you know devonism my daughter is one i really get put in the middle of it you know and probably i could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth to court putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff you know so uh you know i decided it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (1251/ 10721) 
and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (1252/ 10721) 
or um like the art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival and doubling which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that um the concerts on the river on the worthington green really anything like that 

Recording: (1253/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1254/ 10721) 
in 

Recording: (1255/ 10721) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (1256/ 10721) 
they did not know 

Recording: (1257/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1258/ 10721) 
because i mean that is must be how she raises her kids you know and she is i am and that is what i asked her she is got a husband i am like so your husband you believe in cheese yeah i do not believe that i think that is terrible  

Recording: (1259/ 10721) 
i would not doubt it i hope they vote against it but i do not think they will 

Recording: (1260/ 10721) 
but it is kind of it is kind of hard when you have got your your limited choices here you know so but some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you are looking at the new orleans did you watch that debate 

Recording: (1261/ 10721) 
because it stops your heart right away 

Recording: (1262/ 10721) 
they do not have that for columbus schools 

Recording: (1263/ 10721) 
yeah they will just take one script and they will expand it um and and they will just run with that one script and then they are also churches that will just delet they will in in their minds they will delet certain sections of the script that they do not like first christian is chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and personal gets like healing people and and um 

Recording: (1264/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1265/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 10721) 
he is going to he is going to be there all summer yeah i did not decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner um and found out that when i checked the web site for the scan that they are just simply flat out not making one to two thousand drivers from my scanners so it is a um crap i do not know i just got it i can not remember what it is um paperport i think it is paperport uhhuh 

Recording: (1267/ 10721) 
he is running the illegal business here 

Recording: (1268/ 10721) 
boy that is a that is a really tough one i had not i had not thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touchy about sexual identity and and so likely you know so insecure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a has a different area and i i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (1269/ 10721) 
which it did not want to throw yeah 

Recording: (1270/ 10721) 
i like to think that maybe even this thing you know could be like a saying sorry for them to come in and get some peace of mind or something you know uhhuh 

Recording: (1271/ 10721) 
for the land out there 

Recording: (1272/ 10721) 
they did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really really understand different in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clint so i think for the average voter that does have uh a lot of sway 

Recording: (1273/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1274/ 10721) 
and your display might be different but it is it is basic information and our and we developed the system the people started doing that on us sharing the data um actually it started here they do not have a shoot campus and they were independent 

Recording: (1275/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i guess so i mean there are people spending seventy percent hours on computers doing this type of thing just going out there and seeing what they can find 

Recording: (1276/ 10721) 
but i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (1277/ 10721) 
then my little electric shock thing 

Recording: (1278/ 10721) 
no thank goodness or if i did i would blanked it all  

Recording: (1279/ 10721) 
well my husband is allergic when we first got together but i have to admit um it is it is they well he went he goes to he has other allergies um so he gets shots and things but you know they always say it is the pet dender 

Recording: (1280/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1281/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (1282/ 10721) 
um i would like to teach um the the field is particularly saturated right now so i am not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i could distinguished myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am approaching things like whatever happens happens i am going to pursue my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career 

Recording: (1283/ 10721) 
yeah i do not know that is so controversial i i mean i mean to the point i mean they shall not have a problem with them but kind of and then you know they in public schools and it is like well are you noting sex that is it do i 

Recording: (1284/ 10721) 
they are dare 

Recording: (1285/ 10721) 
ah i 

Recording: (1286/ 10721) 
those are the mass people you got to find out and figure out what needs they are going to roll into like when they get older you know you get into the wheelchair companies or something somewhere it is just going to be massive 

Recording: (1287/ 10721) 
so there was a couple people that went but probably two out of five hundred and nobody wanted to move  so i stayed here 

Recording: (1288/ 10721) 
but then uh it is like that some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that and if i was in church of it i would cut some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (1289/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1290/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1291/ 10721) 
yeah i i thought in the beginning i missed mary lake cafe is so bad you have the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (1292/ 10721) 
and one of them they would looked at in columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well children you have the high one of the highest property out rates in they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money so my my feeling is you know there is a lot of programs in school that is sponsored by as federal government particularly uh to help the students are that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (1293/ 10721) 
you know to get a a four or five dollar a year tax cut 

Recording: (1294/ 10721) 
nursure and feed and you know it it meets all of these needs it is kind of like it is just yeah umhum umhum umhum umhum oh i believe it 

Recording: (1295/ 10721) 
well you get the casinos river boat casinos open you get all the pretty much every store on the corner is got a lottery machine take it is 

Recording: (1296/ 10721)

Recording: (1310/ 10721) 
he the last five minutes the teacher say you know you really need to get that down he would sit down and write it in the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and he could do it that quickly uh i think he is lost ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade the school he went to was an open car and uh he had been through some couple of traditional schools already and the principals we told the we had talked to the principal about the problems that are having 

Recording: (1311/ 10721) 
well you have seen people driving the wrong way on the freeway right

Recording: (1313/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (1314/ 10721) 
that does not obviously the the civilization is going to be dead you know so 

Recording: (1315/ 10721) 
you would think by now you know this would not matter 

Recording: (1316/ 10721) 
the way i feel 

Recording: (1317/ 10721) 
go ahead if you 

Recording: (1318/ 10721) 
helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things

i mean well that guy who could change for them that and in the movie they were about to kiss and i i do not like it when they get that close i i like the oh their their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they are very good friends and they have that attention but they do not to it and i really like it i just dislike it a little less 

Recording: (1320/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1321/ 10721) 
so my buck i steal but there is a little bit more you can do with those than burn them you know you could set them up and uh some kind of top secret lab you know out in dc somewhere a pentagon just have rooms and rooms back full guns and i mean how in case we have to do have to go to war you know just keep that little reserve 

Recording: (1322/ 10721) 
that often they do but there is just not near as many of them i can count on one hand the number of uh men teachers i have known over the and elementary ed practically um you know five maybe six that is that is probably why the boys do not you know yeah 

Recording: (1323/ 10721) 
we try and you know we try and and teach and expand people is knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ they do not have you know they do not have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something you know that somebody asks them something and they are like you know i do not know or they actually have an answer you know if if and if they do not know they will say i do not know but i can find out for you if you are willing to if you are willing to give me the time to go find out oh 

Recording: (1324/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1325/ 10721) 
there i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that  did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more or than high school 

Recording: (1326/ 10721) 
uhhuh to to stay around the situation we have a way uh can not do it often just a half hour drive away if they will if they will not it is 

Recording: (1327/ 10721) 
that is not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they do not understand math either even though it is very concrete

Recording: (1339/ 10721) 
personally 

Recording: (1340/ 10721) 
he seemed to confused parenting with controlling 

Recording: (1341/ 10721) 
yeah and 

Recording: (1342/ 10721) 
went on fishing and came back and so he just got accepted into that college but yeah

wow 

Recording: (1354/ 10721)

i think that influences how everybody becomes not only the kids the adults too 

Recording: (1356/ 10721)

Recording: (1413/ 10721) 
and they have always they always they have to go i guess it is not a recreational church it is more ruled by the the it is like a it is not a dio but it is more ruled by the convention and the convention tells you where to go 

Recording: (1414/ 10721) 
the kinds of buildings that people can build and in the university area commission we dealt with that we dealt with zoning whether something would be commercial or multifam family residence we dealt with parking  yeah  a lot yeah yeah

absolutely 

Recording: (1418/ 10721) 
new kids the boyfriend girl from the different things they are trying behind the building you know and just the boy girl i mean just not nice  no 

Recording: (1419/ 10721) 
not too much uh i was planning on i had not always planned on taking a year off but getting into the research uh uh like one of the things i sacrificed was looking into grad schools and applying to grad school this past year so yeah so uh i mean i i would like to go here it is one of my choices because i like the faculty and i like the program but uh uh i plan to spend the next couple months well 

Recording: (1420/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (1421/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1422/ 10721) 
and they collect the cards 

Recording: (1423/ 10721) 
they just uh 

Recording: (1424/ 10721) 
uh she is actually at uh columbia state she is going to study to be a teacher 

Recording: (1425/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (1426/ 10721) 
and then that or uh sort of good 

Recording: (1427/ 10721) 
yeah a low yeah it is just amazing when she went to aerobics class she said my i am believe it how these that they could not get up off the floor or anything they were all having trouble and she said there i was with my cup takes them my chito is you know and she said they had bought water or very you know but she is like i said she just turned twenty eight she is so 

Recording: (1428/ 10721) 
i could not see myself doing that and you know 

Recording: (1429/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (1430/ 10721) 
uh well my son he worked on the coleman campaign so of course uh you know i had to get out and you know help him put the fine uh all that kind of stuff and i got the bumper sticker got some people in my family some bumper sticker some neighbors 

Recording: (1431/ 10721) 
about you know and uh i was just brought up to being an honest person and um unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they sell out their ideals and their principals for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially excused to sell those ideals out um not that kind of person and i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor 

Recording: (1432/ 10721) 
we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over for a year so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hardware to install it and uh uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and they built it overnight for eight things uh if there was any kind of uh special 

Recording: (1433/ 10721) 
yeah like like sort of i mean with like mp three is and stuff and people do a lot of that but it is it is i do not know i do not know i i do not really go on the internet a lot much like 

Recording: (1434/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1435/ 10721) 
and i mean those are legal obviously um obviously things like when you start getting into cocaine pcp things like that those are a little bit more serious 

Recording: (1436/ 10721) 
so they are really hypocritical 

Recording: (1437/ 10721) 
you know and that was and that worked out well but i think too like with my school schedule you know if i am just in class maybe you know three four days a week and then the rest of the time in the evening jay is going to be there so it is not like i am relying on her every single day all the time to do that and i really would not want to put my child in day care 

Recording: (1438/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1439/ 10721) 
we really like her and she has helped to straighten him around a lot he is been under uh psychologist care for about three years and a psychiatrist for about a year and a half 

Recording: (1440/ 10721) 
whatever is going on i always have to have a backup plan though and then i know well if this happens this will work and if this does not happen this way then this is all we will do instead 

Recording: (1441/ 10721) 
and we will just watch okay come on it is got to be he made okay he made the three minutes three seconds to laugh he made we went does that make the game an interesting deal 

Recording: (1442/ 10721) 
hardly at all which uh you know it is actually my family is business so um i started working there to help them out but you know as i have been working there for a while i want to move up you know so 

Recording: (1443/ 10721) 
you can get into catch twenty two because of legislation and i mean you can not require i do not see how you can require a  a a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the for the guns and and and do all that stuff because that in case where burglar comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you should not have one unless you are a sportsman and uh then you know you are it is not going to be worth it to have 

Recording: (1444/ 10721) 
he would been burned front and back he was in the hospital burned word for i do not know two or three weeks and it it was uh the year that one of the years that is my high state league and the rose bowl now  that is news talking uh i did not know by at the time but uh and the during the time that he was there a girl who had he would been going with just

Recording: (1448/ 10721) 
well i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i started taking classes about you know kids with eighty hd and stuff and little by little you know i had my master is in learning disabilities and it was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and 

Recording: (1449/ 10721) 
uh i had three months and then i got postnoted then i got postnoted again and i was like this stupid in exchange for post noting it again my rational was fine i will give myself another ten day 

Recording: (1450/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1451/ 10721) 
and she would not have learned that a whole day kindergarten here 

Recording: (1452/ 10721) 
and then you start to lose that you know what i mean you really you really do start to lose your mental 

Recording: (1453/ 10721) 
just to make it easier on everybody 

Recording: (1454/ 10721)

Recording: (1461/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1462/ 10721) 
i think so 

Recording: (1463/ 10721) 
yeah parents are very into this um my sister has no idea where she wants to go but uh they took me around all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted  go do i do 

Recording: (1464/ 10721) 
that is just it is ridiculous 

Recording: (1465/ 10721) 
that is true book reading well i think it is a normal reading book and stuff but you know you are sitting there or you are like reading a magazine did you know what this guy did you know look down at him to do to see what this guy did 

Recording: (1466/ 10721) 
good because to me parents who put kids in day care and uh you know after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the w morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go will be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (1467/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (1468/ 10721) 
than when we leave his eyes are edging and 

Recording: (1469/ 10721) 
that  

Recording: (1470/ 10721) 
um three years 

Recording: (1471/ 10721) 
no i work for the company but i can solve on a lot of projects within the company um yeah we are doing pretty well it is about a hundred and fifty million dollar business 

Recording: (1472/ 10721) 
um but recently they are getting into going to church um 

Recording: (1473/ 10721) 
gun boxes or picking break in anything uh but when i was a kid too we used to go out to turkey shoots and i would go hunting all the time so i was pretty he with guns my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns but he also knew not to touch them 

Recording: (1474/ 10721) 
but uh you know i knew that uh they would already made that promise and there is a lot of businesses that could move out of that area you know and half those taxes come to columbus even if a business is in west orville half the the employees tax they are going to um west of ill and half are coming to columbus 

Recording: (1475/ 10721) 
yeah it is weird they uh this microphone is a little bit different so 

Recording: (1476/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (1477/ 10721) 
down there with the laws and physics told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the firekeeper breaks them out of the out the fire pit and brings them into the what well it is just their red orange blowing you know tell me they are not hot so that is that is one example um 

Recording: (1478/ 10721) 
i mean i used to this uh boy like you know jumping all over the house and 

Recording: (1479/ 10721) 
shopping you know it is but it is just become a really good metropolitan city i mean it is on its way 

Recording: (1480/ 10721) 
using the money for the using the money for other things and not realizing that they supposed to be putting that money back in a business you know but i was running around bunch of other people that basically were doing the same thing you know so 

Recording: (1481/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (1482/ 10721) 
i you know maybe i am oblivious to things but i mean i mean it seems like there is a lot of worse places 

Recording: (1483/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (1484/ 10721) 
because that that is happened where he is like i will not do it again and and he did again i feel like once it is cheaper always cheaper to me you know maybe maybe to an ex woman he will not do it to but he is gotten away with it so many times with me i feel like he would not really do it you know 

Recording: (1485/ 10721) 
the word harassment please apart you are harassment that individual because you are standing there waiting for him to commit this problem and i let us just get one away from that example you can talk about whether you you were carrying uh well i do not want to get into the guns and knives and stuff and school with and 

Recording: (1486/ 10721) 
uh oh okay well you know the shot is 

Recording: (1487/ 10721) 
not really national system it is already been put to national if they rate them state to state and city to city but on on the level of the actual needs of the student you know you can not just put down you know a book and say i want you to put five hundred words on this page while you like this or dislike this book i mean one person can do it and another one i mean 

Recording: (1488/ 10721) 
yeah they do um i think it is something like sixty percent 

Recording: (1489/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1490/ 10721) 
did you get a tape everything i do not care if it is overtime or not it is on 

Recording: (1491/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (1492/ 10721) 
yeah not really i mean i go to like i go to this club access sometimes but i mean that is short north or whatever like it is okay um i like i do not know i mean the red zone is downtown but i really do not go that i do not like that place but um i do not know uh kind of the way to much really kill like doing anything like really any like foot traffic type things i mean in the summer it seems that it 

Recording: (1493/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1494/ 10721) 
that would be fine but again i do not it is just another person with a different life style like they are they are they are just same as me 

Recording: (1495/ 10721) 
yeah i do not see that kind of raises at all 

Recording: (1496/ 10721) 
yeah and uh in the eighth grade he took the ninth grade efficiency test and passed off four parts the first time uh so he was learning what they we are teaching which uh that is another problem teaching to a test but um that is a whole different problem uh 

Recording: (1497/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (1498/ 10721) 
i mean he wanted us to be together or he wanted us to have a house he wanted to have my kid have his last name and i was like uh are you crazy this out as somebody else is you know kid not yours and he he he did not like that he loved my son you know and we are still good friends and he still comes to see my son but i could not 

Recording: (1499/ 10721) 
no no uh there is a few towny bars but college students are real welcome there so 

Recording: (1500/ 10721) 
and programs like that they were good down home programs that taught good values to the children but now they put some of those stupid i can not even or stand them some of the comedies that they supposedly have on with these funny characters and everything else they do not look anybody we see walking around the earth why do they have them on there 

Recording: (1501/ 10721) 
to preach and they were always in places like washington state and louisiana and tennessee and idaho and  oregon just everywhere  but it made it interesting to visit them  

Recording: (1502/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (1503/ 10721) 
i do not really go over to the east side very uh very often you know sometimes we go over you know in high school drive on the other you know or something like that but um i do not i do not know as far as i do not really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i do not know if it is the media then it is you know kind of portrays those there is more than there used to be um i know that when i was younger i was allowed to to do a lot more things uh by myself like to to go places on the bus 

Recording: (1504/ 10721) 
for the responsibility i took on as being a parent so that is my job  even though it is mundane and  monotonous time 

Recording: (1505/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1506/ 10721) 
uh but you know they tend to say i would say of those there is about three three to four of them that are vietnam boaters uh a day and they tend to come back i mean i originally started going in there just drinking coffee you know to kill time and everything you know then uh and i kind of know everybody you know and somebody walking in i was saying yeah it was growing you know and i have talked and there is i there is another thing too about a lot of the uh people back uh in vietnam there 

Recording: (1507/ 10721) 
we we do not necessarily overcome bad by bad we are still very much in that frame of cover efforts in this on this particular planet 

Recording: (1508/ 10721) 
thinks  i do not feel like a grandma either so i have to be careful what i do they still watch me i guess  

Recording: (1509/ 10721) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (1510/ 10721) 
yeah cards with the characters and they all have different powers the daughter has this thing called a pockety deck you know i like what is a pocket deck she has she is a pocket deck so we if this thing it is a little computer you open it up you print in the name of the person you want to it puts up his picture tells you all the information about him what kind of character is what his powers are or whatever you know it is just like mind bomb yeah it is that is what it is of all the broken and i just like you know i do not know where it leads you know like it 

Recording: (1511/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1512/ 10721) 
we took um or i took uh military athletics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that iraqi there is still certain contacts within the contacts of war for instance if if we both know if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we are fighting for whatever it costs but if we both are willingness going into it 

Recording: (1513/ 10721) 
from our friends that have gone yeah what is their discipline is expiling child from school well they are expiling them to a home where the parents working where they are just getting three days a free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are not learning from that 

Recording: (1514/ 10721) 
if they have someone who gets a grant who is already planning to go to their school so um  

Recording: (1515/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1516/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1517/ 10721) 
was up i would not have got hit i mean there is no two ways about it but if i did not get hit i would not be where i am going to especially so i do not refuse as an accident and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talk to uh went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised when i was raised in i know those people could survive me with any adequate things in terms of counseling i know they tried i know they did the best that they could but um there is a lot of 

Recording: (1518/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1519/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1520/ 10721)

Recording: (1524/ 10721) 
uh i you had women that were working before you had women working before but selfdiscipline is a big thing on family that is part of it selfdiscipline make the things too easy for us oh we can not do without uh you ever you ever try to work for i mean you really struggle to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (1525/ 10721) 
that is where we are in our evolution  

Recording: (1526/ 10721) 
to deal with 

Recording: (1527/ 10721) 
uh  

Recording: (1528/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1529/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1530/ 10721) 
two years of senior in high school i mean there was not anything too serious it was just more i guess a test off your own trip or something 

Recording: (1531/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1532/ 10721) 
my dad had to be time to beat in cincinnati which they probably should have killed and then who you that it was like beating it you know

Recording: (1535/ 10721) 
uh you have got to have the leadership uh you have got to have the right people uh to have this school structured humphly and that you know the people with the right credentials uh for the job you know and uh i am telling you some of these principals that uh that i have dealt with uh were highly overpaid 

Recording: (1536/ 10721) 
no i i personally do not because uh you know i have seen maybe not to the degree of the violence but i mean i still do it with violence uh stuff when i was a kid you know and bigoted by a person 

Recording: (1537/ 10721)

because i would have got my house well 

Recording: (1605/ 10721) 
it is a lot of money 

Recording: (1606/ 10721) 
um i think some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i still go through that i think we all go through that at some point or other even yearly for some of us um so so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or 

Recording: (1607/ 10721) 
no okay  small world  

Recording: (1608/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1609/ 10721) 
going willing to adopt uh a black child or a mixed raised child or an asian child or anything are are going to be sensitive to the to cultural things because we are just you know it is just the the way things are slanted these days i mean diversity is an issue and people who are willing to venture they are out into uh mixed race adoption would already be way 

Recording: (1610/ 10721) 
as a teacher how would you and how could you cut down a student and say no that is not the way it was and it is this you are looking for the teacher is guide no but how do you know about asking a person but it is a matter of tradition and having it down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way and it is it is not say written down but it is passed on those days probably written down or not written down by a verbal and extended it and so it is that hand 

Recording: (1611/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1612/ 10721) 
to milk cartel was 

Recording: (1613/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1614/ 10721)

Recording: (1615/ 10721) 
oh interesting 

Recording: (1616/ 10721)

i got a friend of mine that graduated from uh purdue university of indiana or something like that i think that is where it was i said bu pea university 

Recording: (1620/ 10721) 
well i think they got that old off of um the tv i mean that influenced 

Recording: (1621/ 10721) 
it is just because it is in the name of government they are suspicious and uh 

Recording: (1622/ 10721) 
by saying that um coleman had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for a chief but he voted for a raise for the the police officers it is just that you know the police he is was tied to his and i do not like people who tried to manipulate facts uh and and that was manipulating the facts i did not like that she was um uh uh uh against the the the tip uh in hilarious once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with 

Recording: (1623/ 10721) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if they were used to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns uh 

Recording: (1624/ 10721) 
yeah different there is there is only so much town so that they lose it 

Recording: (1625/ 10721) 
but yet they got people we had no manager say for three months so of course they took somebody that they were going to lay off put them in a management position they are making eighty thousand dollars a year 

Recording: (1626/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1627/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (1628/ 10721) 
that is cool 

Recording: (1629/ 10721) 
oh okay okay it is probably growing up and i and i have been there done that too but still you have to you have to um know this respect out there to be warranted and expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then um they saw the interaction with the elderly people the school he went to their law public involvement public service required the teachers uh 

Recording: (1630/ 10721) 
so it is a good money maker 

Recording: (1631/ 10721) 
huhuh 

Recording: (1632/ 10721) 
yeah i actually have a bunch of numbers here that i hope i did not lose yeah i got uh three people to call see about jobs there should be in within middle of the week yeah because gas money is i can do construction cooking actually took columbus public schools cooking test and passed it so i am  technically a cook 

Recording: (1633/ 10721)

Recording: (1634/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (1635/ 10721) 
um as far as my brother goes i can not say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town uh but usually he is either at work because he works full time then he has he is a part time student at columbia state um so i do not really see him during the day and then at and i do usually goes out to see this thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on 

Recording: (1636/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (1637/ 10721) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1638/ 10721) 
i bet you have  you just did not know it  

Recording: (1639/ 10721) 
well this has been you 

Recording: (1640/ 10721) 
what i am doing 

Recording: (1641/ 10721) 
or she she um she does not know all about all of them you know like she found out about the eighty age just like we all you know i guess like a couple of the kids in the class had had it or on it you know and she was like oh was that and she is like oh i have to figure out that stuff you know she called uh one of the his workers and figured out the whole program and she come in and told another girl about it she told me about it hm 

Recording: (1642/ 10721) 
of uh all the off campus kids to like to the police and so like they would start driving around around ten thirty try and bust them for noise on the weekends so it is pretty hectic 

Recording: (1643/ 10721) 
and i would definitely keep an eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (1644/ 10721) 
now they have different art classes and different speech and uh language classes different levels of science and it is kind of like a which campus 

Recording: (1645/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1646/ 10721) 
you probably see it better now not that far  not that one but yeah it is just certain things make person themselves 

Recording: (1647/ 10721) 
you want my name now 

Recording: (1648/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1649/ 10721) 
i have always been like in the financial and political end and the other side of my brain wants them to work 

Recording: (1650/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1651/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i uh if if uh there there can not be sanctions for doing the right thing and and um uh so i would be i am opposed to that i well yeah i i guess you would have to say that i would i would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything um in in in that relation that it is just that the effort should focus on on getting the 

Recording: (1652/ 10721) 
yeah i take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it is i do not i am gonna take twenty nine hours of it 

Recording: (1653/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1654/ 10721) 
oh yeah no no no no  um honestly no i am pretty shy for the most part so there is more types 

Recording: (1655/ 10721) 
yeah he went to columbus public schools well you know i i am catholic and i went to catholic schools and so i tried that with both my kids uh public schools and uh for a couple years and so he was in uh catholic school couple years they got he got expalled because he is uh the hd 

Recording: (1656/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1657/ 10721) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (1658/ 10721) 
just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are being part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot um and i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is always have to do with money and i am not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked in all these big large classrooms and it just seems to me when 

Recording: (1659/ 10721) 
um he is a business man 

Recording: (1660/ 10721) 
yeah it it says 

Recording: (1661/ 10721) 
it was real close to my home  

Recording: (1662/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (1663/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (1664/ 10721) 
i got a son and then he is got a son so i guess i am a grandfather i hardly ever see him 

Recording: (1665/ 10721) 
okay that is a good job i mean because you are the flex time yeah it was 

Recording: (1666/ 10721) 
uh i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like like that but they were like the barry boys and stuff you know we are uh you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake you know uh and i never really thought about when i was growing up as it was what was real and everything i i always knew that by either again you know by my dad being 

Recording: (1667/ 10721) 
anyway he he went in for listen here i think and then he was dished towards and then he was called back and and send to vietnam and it was uh sort of a traumatic experience for him that i think he is pretty do well come out of her but he was in a rear area he never was up where he was doing any shooting himself but hm 

Recording: (1668/ 10721) 
i do not know what kind that is because i know they they have traded airplanes since i have been gone 

Recording: (1669/ 10721) 
what is our job 

Recording: (1670/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (1671/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1672/ 10721) 
um i think they might have tried anyhow but obviously they would not have been as uh good at it or you know what i am trying to say would not have been as much destruction because obviously the bombs is something but to actually have that right there i mean have the access and whatnot i mean i guess the grandparents had the house like and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew how to use them and that scares me 

Recording: (1673/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1674/ 10721) 
these loose ends that they keep having i suspect they probably will not do that they will um leave things open ended for future tv movies or maybe another uh feature length movie uh 

Recording: (1675/ 10721) 
he is 

Recording: (1676/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (1677/ 10721) 
and then you do your residency you do not have to do residency but if you ever want to go clinical you have to do it 

Recording: (1678/ 10721) 
i said there is a big 

Recording: (1679/ 10721) 
not giving up hope or nothing like that i am just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh you know there is just uh um it is very limited out there you know and and your education is is an asset but like i said even as a person uh now going through there are um i am discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelor is in other words uh bureau of vacation rehabilitation 

Recording: (1680/ 10721) 
oh yeah i am oh i always wear tshirts i do not i am a tshirt person i do not like things in my arms like i do not like bracelet or anything 

Recording: (1681/ 10721) 
the part now it takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching 

Recording: (1682/ 10721) 
um yes i have not they talked about that here actually have they talked about 

Recording: (1683/ 10721) 
i am hoping that will be the same experience as it is in the high states 

Recording: (1684/ 10721) 
and i think that sometimes they do not even count all the voters i mean sometimes that they really want to go through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen and that somehow or other they will count it so dead or they will you know 

Recording: (1685/ 10721) 
like that like military but like unlimited military that does not seem right either but 

Recording: (1686/ 10721) 
i tried falling volunteering you know picking them up doing a volunteer thing and i would get calls all during the night to you know pick these kids up because i thought it was doing something to help but you know you know not helping them 

Recording: (1687/ 10721) 
in a fashion that makes it almost diametrically opposed to mine at great many times but at the same time the the free religion understanding of something 

Recording: (1688/ 10721) 
very much too faced the mother especially because i i know she is talked about men stuff which hurts my feelings because i am i am i mean i might cause them and you know i do not cause him if you you know and when he is at their house we will get an argument and that is what does it makes him not like me because the the yelling and stuff but i do not i feel i feel like i am not the one that makes him you know 

Recording: (1689/ 10721) 
control problems of course there is always the lakes down there yeah well it could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that it is drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and that is why i quit  yeah 

Recording: (1690/ 10721) 
but there is things that are difficult like there uh just that where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to fit fit certain criteria they have to be baptized and not and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and but that is not what they are interested in doing so and and that is hard i think and like 

Recording: (1691/ 10721) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have the things to worry about that people do now when i was in elementary and junior high and we would they never dreamed of anybody having a good gun or even let alone a knife i mean that and that is violence and that is that goes back to kids and how much time and and effort you put into them you know kids are ignored and pushed aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and you know and then they 

Recording: (1692/ 10721) 
as i was teasing  

Recording: (1693/ 10721) 
but i do not see it as negatives affecting me i still get all this stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1694/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1695/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1696/ 10721) 
yeah my dad is a chauvinist pig but he still lives 

Recording: (1697/ 10721) 
i mean it is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean they are you know the portions are a lot smaller it is more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean the obesity problem here and everything else i mean it it is getting worse there than it was but i mean it is nowhere is it anywhere near and that is a large part of the like problem with that oh 

Recording: (1698/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (1699/ 10721) 
yeah okay 

Recording: (1700/ 10721) 
 they are definitely i thought they would be a lot better they they picked up konga and then on top of it they were they were good without a and now they picked them up and they seem to be doing they still struggling up like i understand that up at the indians are horrible right now i like i watched a game yesterday and there was i think they were a few days ago seven and a half games back from the chicago white sox we watched the game yesterday and uh i do not know if we have a lot of injuries or anything because i do not really follow the indians but 

Recording: (1701/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1702/ 10721) 
i could i could it might take me a uh a year or two 

Recording: (1703/ 10721) 
oh yeah that is beautiful yeah 

Recording: (1704/ 10721) 
so be it you know we had the ribbers out there helping out the the gi is fine team effort was not it but then after ti is came home the little a wim back into the house and business all these idle lines say hey we can do something here because those days little as they said well i will go out to the little odd job well we want to let her think mom would do a pick up little extra things here and so forth that was the primary bread winner but she has gotten this odd jobs just to compliment their needs 

Recording: (1705/ 10721) 
there was pregnant girls in middle school 

Recording: (1706/ 10721) 
you know and i really you know fault myself for that but it is made me more aware too and i you know when you look at somebody and he is oh you would never dream that they well i do you know there is not anything i do not put past anybody doing i really do not because they just yeah no no i do because there is some good ones out there and there is some bad ones too but you know 

Recording: (1707/ 10721) 
oh i am i am sure the fact that my parents um my mother tried to real try it is really hard but my my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so they he insisted you know he he could drink on the weekends and never miss work et cetera yeah there was no problem and uh um but the biggest problem um is the fact that you know i um i i i have always expected to have some sort of a respect from them 

Recording: (1708/ 10721) 
that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1709/ 10721) 
you even got these uh what snuck guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (1710/ 10721) 
and the real meaning behind it so 

Recording: (1711/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1712/ 10721) 
and basically they were a three weeks long they are about four and a half hours the first one was really long you know jay said  last night was not so bad though i mean the person was a lot of lot of information classroom kind of stuff but he did well he was much he is just a sweet he is just wonderful he was much more interactive then then a lot of the other guys were just kind of you know they would sit there and they were not breathing and they were kind of rolling their eyes and i just think god you budget a bunch you know it is going to come down to it 

Recording: (1713/ 10721) 
oh well they knew all all different things i mean i mean culturally you know it was different different music that was it course i am i am in a suburban high school and nob you did not get exposed to much uh so that that was the biggest thing well of course they talk funny in the east but um that you know other than that other than they have been the culture shock um it was not it was not that different 

Recording: (1714/ 10721) 
right if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but in in in election in times a weekend is a couple of centuries uh a year is not eon you know so anything can happen between now and then but i think a dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate um which is basically where clinton plays 

Recording: (1715/ 10721) 
because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the height of arrogance um you know but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not no it is it is not a mind that i have so it is hard for me to understand 

Recording: (1716/ 10721) 
excuse me 

Recording: (1717/ 10721) 
their generation right before me so we are stuck right in the middle i do not even think we have a generation 

Recording: (1718/ 10721) 
what it was called but it had got these big names from things umhum 

Recording: (1719/ 10721) 
and she is taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctors uh orders and she is very careful what she eats and 

Recording: (1720/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1721/ 10721) 
right the same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older pokes right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situations got that way but i do believe that the older people including our government people and everybody at the top has to set the example an 

Recording: (1722/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1723/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1724/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1725/ 10721) 
umhum right right 

Recording: (1726/ 10721) 
so uh goldman you know you had a good uh record 

Recording: (1727/ 10721) 
i was raised so dumb i am not you know i was not going for that stuff anymore and he is still wanted to do that you know and lie and cheat make up stories and and he is still does it i do not and and i do not understand why i feel like he is a grown man if he was out do not make up a story and his mother also make you know there are just it just it is very course with me and and i that is another another reason why i do not want my son going there for you know much later um but 

Recording: (1728/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1729/ 10721) 
now is when i need to be off with them you know where we can take them out and run 

Recording: (1730/ 10721) 
already learned an awful amount looking at your real thing okay so bellgum is a 

Recording: (1731/ 10721) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him or two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (1732/ 10721) 
to put into it 

Recording: (1733/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1734/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (1735/ 10721) 
but they are uh because they are both government programs but yeah but i think like i said for the for the younger people because it is uh because it is not their fault their parents can not get health health care so  

Recording: (1736/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (1737/ 10721) 
yeah i think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area um i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now is since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know i am more aware of what going on and i really um going to be some kind of activist for um i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things 

Recording: (1738/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1739/ 10721) 
uhhuh but uh that is a bunch of  that is just one of those myths  i think that is to make people feel guilty or something 

Recording: (1740/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1741/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1742/ 10721) 
and it has not it has not gone far as long that i loaned sharking but you know the the thing of it is it is fun when you win and it is still fun when you lose i mean you know just 

Recording: (1743/ 10721) 
that is cool  that is that is that is the best place that where you have to actually work to get there 

Recording: (1744/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1745/ 10721) 
oh just really not extraordinarily different food necessarily but just just really 

Recording: (1746/ 10721) 
you know what are you going to do you hit that kid you are going to jail 

Recording: (1747/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (1748/ 10721) 
yeah i would be so frustrated i would probably oh i would be really 

Recording: (1749/ 10721) 
but um 

Recording: (1750/ 10721) 
heard that the more conservative unitary churches are in new england around boston where it was started and they are some that are relatively conservative there but um for the most part it is it is what you would call liberal religion yeah  are you 

Recording: (1751/ 10721) 
it is supposed to be a uh let me see school for art 

Recording: (1752/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1753/ 10721) 
here in high school set to see the drug i have been hearing about a a lot fast like you are doing it is definitely so some that is grown 

Recording: (1754/ 10721) 
that is what i was actually thinking of um where he takes the pictures on the corner 

Recording: (1755/ 10721) 
not really yeah he is come to accept it but uh it was her decision yeah it is one thing to know that is the best thing for the baby but it is another thing my wife and i are trying to deal with mostly that we are very family oriented that this is a grandchild we will never get to um that is very hard on us but it is it is an open adoption uh they have met the couple several times uh they promise to you know send pictures and 

Recording: (1756/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1757/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1758/ 10721) 
but full time i would definitely go back when he is in school 

Recording: (1759/ 10721) 
she thinks well you know that kind of makes up for me not working 

Recording: (1760/ 10721) 
yeah and i am going oh this is really interesting you know and and i will drive along and people are just like uh well on the horn and i am like why could you 

Recording: (1761/ 10721) 
i had french in the sixth grade and i got a is i had um german and spanish in the seventh grade and then in the uh eighth grade i had french in the ninth grade i um the ninth grade had french the tenth grade had french and my junior year of high school i had french and my grades went beef straight sees street sees dees street dees and i said i think i should get out now and i stopped taking i did not take fun to my senior year but then the arts and sciences came around and said you will have a fun 

Recording: (1762/ 10721) 
that is 

Recording: (1763/ 10721) 
right there you are over 

Recording: (1764/ 10721) 
true um um and the air that is both fun and brief okay so um my friend chrison irupsters playing on the computer and um my sister is down there she is watching television it sunday morning and um i am trying to figure out how this game works trying to figure out how this game works and then i said i i have got some information on this game out in the car i am going to go get it 

Recording: (1765/ 10721) 
 drink around the world oh boy 

Recording: (1766/ 10721) 
i want you to be a man you know play basketball 

Recording: (1767/ 10721) 
but since all the moms have gone to work and let the tv become the electronic babysitter and the other thing that is happening is kids do not know things all that you would expect them to know like because their moms are not reading to them like they do not know who any of the who is 

Recording: (1768/ 10721) 
you know and i would not be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here 

Recording: (1769/ 10721) 
yeah i think it is further east and where i i was right in the year old mountains so it is like the border of europe and 

Recording: (1770/ 10721) 
they are been a small raised place out there and uh what i remember about it is one morning dad went out to milk and uh milk cows were out on that island 

Recording: (1771/ 10721) 
if i would grown up with the maybe they would have that thing going on my sister has which is a bunch of mexico share mexico experiences but i just i just wear 

Recording: (1772/ 10721) 
too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone that they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going to have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (1773/ 10721) 
i was 

Recording: (1774/ 10721) 
yeah i gave him to my sister and my mom and stuff like that so 

Recording: (1775/ 10721) 
yeah i could skip any program i wanted to you know just show up at the parties basically 

Recording: (1776/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1777/ 10721) 
bashing with him and um there would not have been you know what happened you know to the the black man in jasper texas and uh you know uh the the shepherd boy in what was that oklahoma uh yeah he would not have 

Recording: (1778/ 10721) 
well there that went you know why i mean you can not even have nice stuff in your car anymore 

Recording: (1779/ 10721) 
relationships do not have a girl friend do not have a wife do not nothing like that i have got a dog uh golden retriever 

Recording: (1780/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (1781/ 10721) 
or put you in peak or something you know if there is any problem between students i do not think they they they never would sit down with the students and have them talk it out you know they might send them to peek or something 

Recording: (1782/ 10721) 
music during the summer but they will have regular worse upstairs i think they are at ten thirty now on sunday morning i had a lot of times skip most during the summer   uh 

Recording: (1783/ 10721) 
i said they got babysitting my fire but i guess you you survive okay because you are here  you are still teaching  

Recording: (1784/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1785/ 10721) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (1786/ 10721) 
and you can say well that is how that makes you feel when someone does and you were having to him i hate him the other night i had a him and i threw up and byebye and my mom i threw up all over the floor and i am like do not you ever do that when you are at someone else is home 

Recording: (1787/ 10721) 
he uh told he never said much about it except he told about one time when he was in the hospital up in japan after he was burned he said that he was uh warded with a bunch of other burden patients and and he said the some of them and him included were able to get up and walk around so the and i can see their philosophy the 

Recording: (1788/ 10721) 
not knowing they are going to whip out a gun or not and he ai not going to go to jail 

Recording: (1789/ 10721) 
a little bit 

Recording: (1790/ 10721) 
anybody just can wants to connect to us 

Recording: (1791/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1792/ 10721) 
it is not it is not because i i see where he is and he is really messed up and i i can not do anything for him but i have you know i have i am open to a relationship with them 

Recording: (1793/ 10721) 
uhhuh  

Recording: (1794/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1795/ 10721) 
i was right i forgot you guys have like a big gangerick population you know and like oh i had like you know all these deer and stuff so it is like they have 

Recording: (1796/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1797/ 10721) 
like management here 

Recording: (1798/ 10721) 
but they he kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you are not going to provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so here was a case in my opinion a very very  in honest uh politician but he was also being shoved away from what he thought was an honest approach 

Recording: (1799/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (1800/ 10721) 
 and it is a republican think thing think thing  it is a republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agriculturally i do not know i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community it is great all around for his in the family oh no i want to find a i want to find a some place similar to that i want to find some place too but a lot 

Recording: (1801/ 10721) 
used to be you lived in a little neighborhood you knew all your neighbors you do not have that now everybody is mobile 

Recording: (1802/ 10721) 
uh and we are the fourth 

Recording: (1803/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (1804/ 10721) 
go ahead 

Recording: (1805/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1806/ 10721) 
because like i think it is archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in in in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and about a bad a school you you are going to if you want to do it you can because it and really in some of the schools if you have a learning disability or you know if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and and in uh like worthington and westernville dufflin you know they do not 

Recording: (1807/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1808/ 10721) 
and uh i got about maybe three miles down the road and the cop pulls up just seeing rain 

Recording: (1809/ 10721) 
grandver had that is own school system too but 

Recording: (1810/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1811/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1812/ 10721) 
uh we actually were from plymouth and we moved down to afghans and then uh they moved back up there when i was in the service air force um and two years reserves uh uh basically uh electronic not not an engineer but electronic assembly and stuff like that uh missile systems you know 

Recording: (1813/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1814/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1815/ 10721) 
what his background really was 

Recording: (1816/ 10721) 
and they have met the couple that is going to adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me but 

Recording: (1817/ 10721) 
right and he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends and we still see them a whole lot and we were close with their parents and 

Recording: (1818/ 10721) 
who is dad pays pays her for the baby sitting because i can not afford it 

Recording: (1819/ 10721) 
um i do not know you know 

Recording: (1820/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1821/ 10721) 
i mean if the person knew i would think if the person knew that people are paying for them at charge and and that was important to them and they prayed and 

Recording: (1822/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1823/ 10721) 
back then i was working in a cycle shop but i was in the service while i was working there 

Recording: (1824/ 10721) 
great guy but he is sure like to get drunk you know and the problem is he would turn into such a jerk 

Recording: (1825/ 10721) 
 gets it  

Recording: (1826/ 10721) 
i i do not think so but 

Recording: (1827/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1828/ 10721) 
stop without it um and and that is too bad you know that things are have been that bad in some like a world work too i mean we did not really have any choice there and not to but uh some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh so but you know you can get you can get a philosophy but 

Recording: (1829/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (1830/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1831/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1832/ 10721) 
and uh the other one is uh a uh working company at the student billahio uh 

Recording: (1833/ 10721) 
where i do not think that there is any question they could look right down our throats because and anyway we fired a a couple of times from late they started faring back at us and man scared me 

Recording: (1834/ 10721) 
 yeah well looking at me oh you want a dollar more you know and they are making thousands um but yeah i do not want to do that anymore i want to go somewhere i have got somebody helping me kind of so you know um just an acquaintance of mine um that is kind of a head hunter and i have given him the idea that i want to either work for an attorney that is going to make some changes or you know do do something that way i have got a lot of administration you know and and manager and things like that background so i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also 

Recording: (1835/ 10721) 
the population is much different yes 

Recording: (1836/ 10721) 
okay we got real used well i 

Recording: (1837/ 10721) 
we like to i do i like to cook i enjoy cooking 

Recording: (1838/ 10721) 
play lottery once in a while if i have a couple bucks on me and uh well football games we will not even start with that  

Recording: (1839/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1840/ 10721) 
like i you know could should have stuck in there but i i could not deal with it anymore i mean i go home and you know when i cry i mean it is just these were all adults older than me and it it was just it was really silly 

Recording: (1841/ 10721) 
even it is doing that with that you know or so it is very frustrating for us and the baby they are giving up for adoption so that is a whole different problem 

Recording: (1842/ 10721) 
and it it was fun i met a lot of neat people in fact that is where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one of the artists who came to me and it but it was not nobody was going to make any money on and it and it was the kind of thing that it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project and i did not know anything about it i would never even been in a gallery i thought uh this will be fun i will just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying to think of something i could do with it so i said well i will rent this space and then 

Recording: (1843/ 10721) 
and i said no no you are not 

Recording: (1844/ 10721) 
it is open twenty four hours so there is people that you know it is like shifts over lapping out of something like everybody leaves and then everybody comes in you know it is like um like when we are there like the nights if people start to come in and people who work from like eight to four eight eight p m to four am and that would be really weird i guess like nobody calls then or something like ten people calls so she is like it is easy she is like i get paid to 

Recording: (1845/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1846/ 10721) 
and not all of them or or vietnam buts either you know 

Recording: (1847/ 10721) 
just like almost out of control 

Recording: (1848/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (1849/ 10721) 
oh everyday every day there was something uh it is like i felt like i knew more about clinton sex life than i knew about my  it was about and it was far more than i wanted to know about anybody else is um where as you know in the past there is been since they had a fair the press never even announced it even if they knew it at least that is what you know 

Recording: (1850/ 10721) 
bad they were you know they laid a hand on her of course you know but but uh uh that by her being away other than and her mom is got a cold head on her shoulder she would not let that happen unless you told me about it and she would be private for you to tell me that that catching air plane flight down over there you know just to guy up or something 

Recording: (1851/ 10721)

Recording: (1857/ 10721) 
when i was teaching it that was kind of before all the moms went to work 

Recording: (1858/ 10721) 
because i guess it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt but 

Recording: (1859/ 10721) 
they are 

Recording: (1860/ 10721) 
 it was um well it started out as uh computer science or the college of earth and sciences but then there was this whole four language requirement and a and sit there with the counselor and eventually it became a a proud number of the college of business 

Recording: (1861/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1862/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1863/ 10721)

Recording: (1872/ 10721) 
you know like if our system would shut down if it cost us i do not remember what it is you know tens of thousands of dollars for every hour that were down uh if our data base would be be trashed our main data base would be trash we would have real serious problems and it could take weeks or months to rebuild it uh yeah so it could be a problem uh we got people working in that area 

Recording: (1873/ 10721)

amazing how much the growth in delaware in different areas when i was growing up here and how mary isville was such a farm town um just the growth of the different cities and suburb so columbus is amazing and the housing and 

Recording: (1900/ 10721) 
living and going to those schools because it is very expensive in that area so there is a natural prejudice that colmo is is stupid and worthy in a double and and it is really not true it is just that you know you can not tell all the poor people and the people that do not have two parents do not come to school because when our scores higher but you know when the when the news media goes look how bad brad um 

Recording: (1901/ 10721)

well yeah 

Recording: (1914/ 10721) 
that is nice 

Recording: (1915/ 10721)

Recording: (1916/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (1917/ 10721) 
yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the 

Recording: (1918/ 10721)

Recording: (1919/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1920/ 10721) 
say ask my wife she said i have talked to the devil yeah 

Recording: (1921/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1922/ 10721) 
um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (1923/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1924/ 10721)

Recording: (1929/ 10721) 
as back into into high school 

Recording: (1930/ 10721) 
yeah uh but it is like i mean you there is these stories almost everyday you hear them and that is i mean that is even a big change for every ten years ago 

Recording: (1931/ 10721) 
and the lower you are apparently the easier it is or something that was the coach is philosophy anyway 

Recording: (1932/ 10721) 
judges are bought and paid for they are elected um there is a lot of crap there and i learned all this not from just my experience but from people what i know there are attorneys that there are judges down there that take crimes and that is that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are 

Recording: (1933/ 10721) 
well clowncon is not there  clowncon i you could get like a bag of um two of the rolls and pay only five cents so um that is gone and um that was a kid thing um my grandfather used to own in a men market

Recording: (1938/ 10721) 
if you work at a college or a hospital you make no money yeah pretty much seems like it i i wanted to for a long time now i am just not so sure that i went to two or three more years of school they suggest two to three years for your phd i do not want to do that 

Recording: (1939/ 10721) 
to turn on the news they do not really cover my husband comes from a journalistic background and he will be like that is not news you know what i mean it is just we get so uh let us here and watch playing catch for twelve hours instead of watching i do not know what little house in the prairie i dont know but i am being facetious but what do you mean 

Recording: (1940/ 10721) 
yeah yeah say it is going to be hard to do in some of the other states but i do not think so 

Recording: (1941/ 10721)

Recording: (1942/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (1943/ 10721) 
uhhuh  

Recording: (1944/ 10721) 
inherently wrong to me 

Recording: (1945/ 10721) 
so i am not going to get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (1946/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1947/ 10721) 
um well i have found that that i mean everyone has people from outside the united states have stereo types about the united states um when they actually get to know someone those stereotypes dissipate um i mean i actually had a conversation very similar to just the other night with a couple of germans that i met at a coffee house um i mean the the stereotype that most americans have 

Recording: (1948/ 10721) 
and they stopped doing that now 

Recording: (1949/ 10721)

i was in columbus for the first like six years i taught 

Recording: (1951/ 10721) 
how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the versus to carry those those things out i think it is it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (1952/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (1953/ 10721)

Recording: (1956/ 10721) 
oh the top  

Recording: (1957/ 10721) 
like you just want to sit and like not do anything and like um you know working out as hard and stuff because you know i have time so i want to have a job where if i do not have time i am at the end of the day to work out it is like i am working out sort of like as during my job and like i i really hate talking on the phone now like having jobs for why i why i talk on the phone makes me just not want to talk on the phone at all at home or it is either like when i am on the phone at home like then it like brings weird flashbacks to work so it is like i will start like 

Recording: (1958/ 10721) 
i have done it for the last uh about five years 

Recording: (1959/ 10721) 
people were constantly on me but oh what are americans so funny like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (1960/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1961/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1962/ 10721) 
yeah i mean it is not i mean it was a really long time ago everything is fine but i guess for me i just it it i do not know it is just it is a little more a little more than i wanted to see the classes i think were helpful but um what would you ask me 

Recording: (1963/ 10721) 
um my both of them are older my sister is like twenty seven twenty eight my brother is twenty four 

Recording: (1964/ 10721)

Recording: (1967/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1968/ 10721) 
okay fine and the family probably said okay we we want you to get advanced we want you are good will the problem is you may have a culture difference culture difference over here and so forth and then we became a little more uh promiscuous and so gee you know mom dad and so forth elm was going out here in west you know and so forth and they think everything is been okay because we did not have communication as frequent and then all of a sudden you find out and usually mom found out 

Recording: (1969/ 10721) 
oh i yeah really  

Recording: (1970/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (1971/ 10721) 
sure 

Recording: (1972/ 10721) 
yeah they do not know about it but then you know they like you said they do not want to see it 

Recording: (1973/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1974/ 10721) 
and he knew it was a bush or or  

Recording: (1975/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1976/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (1977/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1978/ 10721) 
they are good 

Recording: (1979/ 10721) 
that you really can get a lot out of it if that is something you want to do and i think as long as you are involved with the school 

Recording: (1980/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (1981/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1982/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1983/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1984/ 10721) 
yeah they really like it they have a huge house in the middle of nowhere out on a farm and my brotherinlaw bought uh his father wendy is business is out and so they have like six wendy is out there so but it is out in the middle of the nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move and try to getting to do this years and years ago and nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really tough running five wendy is in 

Recording: (1985/ 10721) 
try to raise my hopes up about it but then they had this other kid who was actually really into veterinarian medicine and flying helicopters and you know that and he really did go on to uh study about that myself cook  but yeah well 

Recording: (1986/ 10721) 
well that is interesting thing i am not in geology right now i uh i am actually making more money right now in music than i am geology but i am making most of my money in something that is uh relevant to most of my that has nothing to do with any of my studies um yes i i um principal horn in the uh symphony orchestra and um last year i was in a professional singing group 

Recording: (1987/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (1988/ 10721) 
uh we were floating around just did not know if they were going to send us in or not because it was toward the end of it 

Recording: (1989/ 10721) 
oh that is it 

Recording: (1990/ 10721) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about things my oldest sister you know i get is down the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (1991/ 10721) 
so that means you are a good problem solving you are a good logical thinker you are good in science you are good in math you know so there is a few things you are not good at does not mean you are stupid you know i would much rather be stranded on an island with six 

Recording: (1992/ 10721) 
and uh well she the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community uh in but so it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (1993/ 10721) 
 oh that is so nice 

Recording: (1994/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (1995/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1996/ 10721) 
i do not argue with them i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (1997/ 10721) 
um that is probably when he started yeah um 

Recording: (1998/ 10721) 
they just i am not sure really what they do 

Recording: (1999/ 10721) 
mother he used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i i think we should talk i was like okay great kids always like oh boy you are way too serious okay that is what we knew ahead of time those all were coming in androar so i i um at this point in the store i should point out the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not real even in all of the story but it bugs me every time i know of a story because it does not exist anyway 

Recording: (2000/ 10721) 
and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just you know because of the simple fact of the statistics but they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might have as well be you know safe about it 

Recording: (2001/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2002/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (2003/ 10721)

Recording: (2009/ 10721) 
that dot it is gonna be just the opposite and have i can not think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can not think of a negative thing about them because you see christ appearance come through though 

Recording: (2010/ 10721) 
okay i was born in dayton ohio i lived there almost thirty five years before moving to columbus in nineteen eighty one uh lived in uh northwest cl mess for eighteen years uh moved last january a little farther west about five miles further west near hillyard but still live in the city of c columbus uh so i have been here about eighteen nineteen years i like columbus also i think it is a great city although the last three months i have threatened to move on more than one

i uh grew up in is this is this registering it it slipped  

Recording: (2014/ 10721)

Recording: (2019/ 10721) 
i just think it is sad even hearing climates you know like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools and i thought you know i just you know it just could because of all the things you have seen in the world in the last year that these kids want to do that is just to see what is going to happen 

Recording: (2020/ 10721) 
and they they say that is a city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like sixty thousand

Recording: (2070/ 10721) 
to actually claim that we hit but 

Recording: (2071/ 10721)

Recording: (2080/ 10721) 
well i i think that my opinion is that if you can go to school and you are not going you know at work and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know and a lot of kids that is all they really want to do nowadays is just cause aggravation up here 

Recording: (2081/ 10721)

Recording: (2108/ 10721) 
uh basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 

Recording: (2109/ 10721) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and and a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or whatnot just in a split second you know we we might have that once in life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go out you know 

Recording: (2110/ 10721) 
yeah

Recording: (2119/ 10721) 
yeah that is kind of subjective although there is a paper that we hand out to our kids that tells exactly what is supposed to be in every part of the essay like the the first the introduction program supposed to consist of a way to capture the reader is attention as opposed to supply background information it is supposed to your thesis statement which tells mainly what the paper is going to be about and then you are just end the introduction paragraph by listing three ideas about your thesis 

Recording: (2120/ 10721)

Recording: (2131/ 10721) 
they can not fathom that 

Recording: (2132/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (2133/ 10721) 
um well as far as the races and issue first uh they showed some figures on the news and actually it was like more 

Recording: (2134/ 10721) 
so once you convince people there is nothing to be scared of here there is nothing to be scared of there nothing then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning

Recording: (2137/ 10721) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people um bitch and complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political in consulting for the ohio education association i used to go around trying to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important john kennedy won umhum 

Recording: (2138/ 10721) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (2139/ 10721) 
like uh uh oh from mormon is well our basic um real fundamental belief is that the church that the russians believed in one time was the true church and it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on earth with the twelve apples and but after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to um

Recording: (2142/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (2143/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (2144/ 10721) 
so they they could not go in that direction they would have to just bring in new people which uh i think it probably would not be a good idea 

Recording: (2145/ 10721) 
listing the music 

Recording: (2146/ 10721) 
no not my area not my area if it is hot in here

everybody is 

Recording: (2155/ 10721) 
if you just said take or get i just i say well i am just going to because when you get none work out in the work world there is going to be two and two things they care about about your writing is it usable and is it persuaded because usually when you are writing something in the work place it is either to explain something or it is to persuade somebody to do something so if it is not those two things it is not it is not writing that is going to make it in the 

Recording: (2156/ 10721)

Recording: (2168/ 10721) 
and get some information 

Recording: (2169/ 10721) 
well i do not know that that is a cause it they they as a group uh this was kind of that happens to it that this occurred as a result of a very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing thing that it was it was a happen is sense and and part of this mass communication we are talking about uh began with them and yes 

Recording: (2170/ 10721) 
that is exactly what it is  

Recording: (2171/ 10721)

Recording: (2183/ 10721) 
yeah well 

Recording: (2184/ 10721) 
does that make sense 

Recording: (2185/ 10721) 
better to give and i sometimes try to weigh that if that is part of why i i can not believe it is an attention and getter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the work you do but uh but maybe just within maybe one feels uh and i think i think it is a matter of being conscientious too 

Recording: (2186/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (2187/ 10721) 
this is in the summer now we go down to uh oldx river go fishing over there where uh dodge rich is there used to be a bass recreation center which is miniature golf course and everything

i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran 

Recording: (2203/ 10721)

Recording: (2204/ 10721) 
and how how many dollars does a consumer put into research i suppose the business that is the inequality in our life and you are you are basically putting the shop to the consumer 

Recording: (2205/ 10721) 
and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am going to keep with it you know and to me the straightest student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their life at all and the other one has you know activities and they are giving themselves to the community you know you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the p on and they volunteer at cosai and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter hatts for that school is

yeah i like that 

Recording: (2209/ 10721) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with her for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (2210/ 10721) 
i know  umhum that is another thing i forgot to mention  how there children are there are some very well especially in the need for it especially in the umhum exactly just 

Recording: (2211/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2212/ 10721) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school let me get a list of all the voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is 

Recording: (2213/ 10721)

Recording: (2214/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2215/ 10721)

Recording: (2216/ 10721)

Recording: (2219/ 10721) 
where do you do the aerobics 

Recording: (2220/ 10721) 
who cares so you know people just think there is no really no point that you have been vote it is just it is too bad really is 

Recording: (2221/ 10721) 
you know so 

Recording: (2222/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (2223/ 10721) 
i i do not think that it it goes into like values i do not associate like rise in crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i mean if there is a correlation i mean i am i am more of the you know like parents have a greater influence on the children than tv ever could i mean i watch watch a lot of tv but i feel that my parents talk 

Recording: (2224/ 10721) 
i remember mcuffy lane i do not know if you know who they are yeah 

Recording: (2225/ 10721) 
so there was a big fuss about that and two years later they came out with another study that says well they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuild them and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like well if you are going to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (2226/ 10721) 
do you 

Recording: (2227/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2228/ 10721) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (2229/ 10721) 
yeah i like to go up there and play pool once in a while 

Recording: (2230/ 10721) 
so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh but once in a while we we will get win players playing it also and uh sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something 

Recording: (2231/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i do not see figure that out i think it is all i think it is all fixed 

Recording: (2232/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (2233/ 10721) 
the opportunity to serve with another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourselves instead of us others and i think as as we become older you start thinking about how uh much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your face it is not the materialistic things that the university here uh professors to be the thing 

Recording: (2234/ 10721) 
oh yeah yes and no they are kind of where weird like that uh well i have said a grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything there is a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racist um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up 

Recording: (2235/ 10721) 
in this family he came from a buffalo new york working class he laughed he never looked back either and so it is kind of like you know i heard both people i think say you know how we are i i do not know we go the schools are always so grateful to us because we organize the state test tournaments we started the baseball league for this building you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids 

Recording: (2236/ 10721) 
i needed a break 

Recording: (2237/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2238/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2239/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2240/ 10721) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (2241/ 10721) 
in nebraska and commuting so he was either driving or flying a lot 

Recording: (2242/ 10721) 
i was baby you know under one  

Recording: (2243/ 10721) 
yeah and and it just it is moving there the whole you know the strip malls and i was in i spent my first christmas there and bell just a friend and i mean we would drive behind you like oh this is because of you know your country these people are moving in and buying whatever and so conversionally i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than 

Recording: (2244/ 10721) 
thing at first but she my she loves my kids and she loves my husband 

Recording: (2245/ 10721) 
and it is funny too how people carry like people apologize to you when when they are dumb or whatever and it is like like they care so much you know about somebody that they are talking to on the phone for like five minutes um it it is fun people sometimes ask me like where where we are you know i tell them like homicides i do not know like um like i talked to some lady from from uh new jersey she was like twenty or something for for a long time she was she was real funny just uh how how accents are 

Recording: (2246/ 10721) 
actually i think it was stanford it was on a tv show i think it was like extra or something i do not know what it was and they were had a program on where um these older students you know met for the first time and uh at their graduation you know they finished their whole college on internet like i said well that would be very easy for me and i could do it at my convenience like when he is asleep i can go and do that i think it would make it a lot easier 

Recording: (2247/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (2248/ 10721) 
cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (2249/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (2250/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because the nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (2251/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (2252/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (2254/ 10721) 
i do not know anything about the stock market oh man do not let the shirt fool you 

Recording: (2255/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2256/ 10721) 
no without a health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assume you are eighteen you could get a job like and pry and pay for your health insurance i mean i am not saying it would be easy but still 

Recording: (2257/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2258/ 10721) 
all i remember is them talking about condoms i do not think they talked about anything besides that but um then again i could be  wrong um but yes that i mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was a catholic school but we did not have 

Recording: (2259/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2260/ 10721) 
uh how do you picture it 

Recording: (2261/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2262/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (2263/ 10721) 
before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something in debt with it now you can not get back you know it 

Recording: (2264/ 10721) 
 yes pets are 

Recording: (2265/ 10721) 
you know you could give them a a million dollar house up there and and then cover the rest of their life they do not want that they want to live down where we are where we are procompat uh 

Recording: (2266/ 10721) 
well definitely for example within blindness are not always genetic they do not know why they just know that it shows up more in boys than girls this year i do not have one i have sixteen students and i do not have one girl in fact i have not had any girls for a couple of years i usually have one or two girls and all the rest boys but 

Recording: (2267/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2268/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (2269/ 10721) 
well my one friend went to the school in philadelphia for a while but she did not she went to uh like a university of arts which is a like a their school and it is it was real uh like in tents or whatever you know it is like double the the what uh of normal college so she did not like that so she came back it was kind of the same situation that i was like not really know what to do or whatever and then my one friend who were living with like he he 

Recording: (2270/ 10721) 
sounds a lot like our dog 

Recording: (2271/ 10721) 
yeah definitely 

Recording: (2272/ 10721) 
yeah  and him had not been department 

Recording: (2273/ 10721) 
in the business world in other words i used to work uh during uh high school days for a furniture company and those days it was ninety days cash and we would sell to people and there is a and there is a well gee we just and talk to men that oh they they do not have the they do not have the money that is financed at the bank well why are we selling it to them though well we will get our money back and the bank bank it do not mind we will get we will repossess it and we sold the same darn thing over three or four times 

Recording: (2274/ 10721) 
umhum i are 

Recording: (2275/ 10721) 
uh they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimately injured and their lives have been affected that they do not deserve money for whatever uh and it i do not think it is fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it has not happened to the um i do not think that is fair um because it does affect your entire lot has otherwise i would be full time employed 

Recording: (2276/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (2277/ 10721) 
uhhuh it is a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot there how hot who knows but it is been such a strengthening spiritual strengthening thing it also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body what all is that he um it gets all the crap out of you 

Recording: (2278/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (2279/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2280/ 10721) 
no no but hopefully when they do get the one strike somebody i say somebody because uh right now i do not really think we have that in place but we would need more of a um one strike stepping stone you know and i let us face it counseling is probably not going to work uh and somebody in that they would almost take um i do personally know people that go into that 

Recording: (2281/ 10721) 
because this is a great area around here to live and people you know like in clintonville realize that but then we get a little more over i am my daughter was horrified you know that i wanted to buy a house over there but i was single 

Recording: (2282/ 10721) 
the profity tests that they are now requiring you can not graduate from an ohio high school with a with a diploma unless you pass all the profancy tests and and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time in the the end of the eighth grade then you get two tries in the ninth grade two tries in the tenth 

Recording: (2283/ 10721) 
you know they can do it however they want 

Recording: (2284/ 10721) 
ooh boy like action oh bite the bad guys yeah and now it is uh you know like looking in um sort of postulating deeper meaning to like what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a met that for it for things in real life uh and the fact that there is something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and upon our culture i think it is kind of interesting 

Recording: (2285/ 10721) 
and i do not know if it is quite that bad but but it was certainly somethings that he is been doing that are not i do not proved up and i am not real up on that 

Recording: (2286/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2287/ 10721) 
there was one where they were going along and there is a little uh scrunchy looking dog about so long and about that so i kind of fall on long after joe i am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for it is worth all it works off than i am 

Recording: (2288/ 10721) 
um i used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor and i used to go to work at like eight oclock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson and i did this six days a week and to get my my one day off i would get up at like at seven oclock and get my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car 

Recording: (2289/ 10721) 
that are it is uh i mean i i do not have it like my sister she is cooking every day 

Recording: (2290/ 10721) 
crap out of the other giant  

Recording: (2291/ 10721) 
get paid every week for doing nothing 

Recording: (2292/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (2293/ 10721) 
just change the language 

Recording: (2294/ 10721) 
it is probably not as you know like you know as uh convinced as a fact as like most tourist areas because it is a you know australia is a little out of the way yet so you know you know spend some time to get there there is your like you are like you are in florida or california so it is like if you want to go to the beach you do not have to say oh like a memorial day it is like forget it you know just forget it it is like but with australia at least you do not have to worry about you know fighten the taurus 

Recording: (2295/ 10721) 
then then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (2296/ 10721) 
he is from ohio and 

Recording: (2297/ 10721) 
no  

Recording: (2298/ 10721) 
yeah that is how we 

Recording: (2299/ 10721) 
proops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (2300/ 10721) 
and that is i think that is really a major problem and i think there is a lot of problem with young kids today do it my way or uh they all um hit them or 

Recording: (2301/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (2302/ 10721) 
so you can not isolate yourself with them it is like americans do not have a have a have a strong hold on it  

Recording: (2303/ 10721) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule that says that that is okay that is the person does it to you i mean there my mother used to say for every law that was written there is another law written over here that will actually onify that and i and actually as i have grown older i found that it is it is worse than today is world as i said as the silver rights movie and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is 

Recording: (2304/ 10721) 
well i will be honest i have a lot of home exceptial friends and being in the restaurant business and growing up in the restaurant business and that is how i have really kind of met them when i was going to school i did not know any and i went to ou and i will see down there i did not know i did not know anybody was okay um i feel that a lot of people or i will say most of them or all of them are born that way some of them do make a choice um 

Recording: (2305/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (2306/ 10721) 
they 

Recording: (2307/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2308/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2309/ 10721) 
of course with ours if you hit you did not have to hit them direct you hit them right by side them and flip them over 

Recording: (2310/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2311/ 10721) 
yeah this was three years ago about three years ago in august there will be three and yeah it was however many was that an eighty nine or a nineteen or something like that will it is it gets more and more um like uh it is not like america but more and more like a regular democracy see every year i mean not really but it is closer and closer  

Recording: (2312/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2313/ 10721) 
um i prefer i have done it by myself but i would prefer to do it with my husband and stuff 

Recording: (2314/ 10721) 
hist elements 

Recording: (2315/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2316/ 10721) 
what is good now uh well the way i began has changed that there is computers have made a big difference uh it is more exciting now for people who are in the that area uh who are interested in it is more emphasis on information than not books and things going to the library it is getting the 

Recording: (2317/ 10721) 
um he moved to texas because like he was moving into the like he was going to smu there and like so i moved back from florida back to up up here because i did not want to i do not want to go texas texas texas is terrible and like um so then like my mom she like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (2318/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2319/ 10721) 
right uh kind of the usa today syndrome 

Recording: (2320/ 10721) 
exist area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them something 

Recording: (2321/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2322/ 10721) 
you know her her being a ham what is what is what what am i looking for right now that i have lost  uh 

Recording: (2323/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2324/ 10721) 
but time you get there you are allagged out and 

Recording: (2325/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2326/ 10721) 
i have a few kids from time to time that said they want to be writers which you know they have great ideas but usually they can not they can tell you them but when they write my kids usually they leave out words or they leave off a suffix at the end or and the sentence makes no sense you know i have to call warm up and go what does this say 

Recording: (2327/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2328/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2329/ 10721) 
 left marks but it and it sure it hurt i mean it was stained and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up but i ended up being i think a quite successful person and i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty well going decent kids and none of us were injured and none of them were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it it was not something 

Recording: (2330/ 10721) 
um i mean i that is definitely a possibility for a career wise down the road but um i do not know to see sort of what that takes me 

Recording: (2331/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2332/ 10721) 
but  

Recording: (2333/ 10721) 
and everything and so uh i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people the who are or sick and try to help them with their you you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcohol is a is a disease okay and it is so now we try to help alcoh certainly murdering is a 

Recording: (2334/ 10721) 
yeah yeah there is a big water area it is something to do with the little mermaid or whatever but they really enjoy all that we try to do as much as we can and with them outdoor type of thing we do a lot of camping we do a lot of vacationing we try to go to ice a year at least uh her parents live in cape yeah 

Recording: (2335/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2336/ 10721) 
if if if if you say buy buy from those unscoupleous business people i say uh gee these guys got me a credit what happens to that person that files bankruptcy uh my bankruptcy okay i will do something else because the next time 

Recording: (2337/ 10721) 
 uhhuh uhhuh what instrument do you play 

Recording: (2338/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (2339/ 10721) 
uhhuh particularly uh 

Recording: (2340/ 10721) 
so that works out pretty well 

Recording: (2341/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (2342/ 10721) 
not yet i guess 

Recording: (2343/ 10721) 
redden because i do not know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was called i have little things  

Recording: (2344/ 10721) 
and and that what they say that we have done to the language and everything else and and you are not a typical american but you know and then the next hour and a half they just say how pat americans are and you kind of think like well thanks for the exclusion but you still have been insulted me for an hour and a half 

Recording: (2345/ 10721) 
i would not 

Recording: (2346/ 10721) 
that he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us is english teacher and she is saturday night and he knows everything he will teach so i went your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was using reading books like in visible man elmett ellison refer and and element i guess it is anyway um and writing papers on his reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story 

Recording: (2347/ 10721) 
is it often so similar to where i am coming from 

Recording: (2348/ 10721) 
they are wild animals you know and i mean i saw a show last week on fox that was called when good pets go bad too 

Recording: (2349/ 10721) 
and i like the area it is pretty flat down there and then plus these several houses got to do a lot of good places to fish 

Recording: (2350/ 10721) 
it is actually not that difficult but 

Recording: (2351/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2352/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (2353/ 10721) 
i think it is just if it were vietnam best i think it is the authority thing you know yeah you lie to me once you lie to me four hundred times since then you know 

Recording: (2354/ 10721) 
in any pregnancy three weeks in either direction is considered full term 

Recording: (2355/ 10721) 
instructions from the creative through vision through a woman called them white white buffalo california that came to the people and brought them to these seminars like the sweatline they brought them to staker pipe it is not a it is not a belief thing it is a way of life and it is a way of life that is still a danger of being snuffed out but it will not be it is just it will not be it is just we got to be careful about uh how in what you do and if you look you know native 

Recording: (2356/ 10721) 
i have never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women are not precious is because they could do not show any kind of a spiritual leadership i i have never heard that said and so must be people who think that 

Recording: (2357/ 10721) 
what is that 

Recording: (2358/ 10721) 
uh relax uh get a a debt in job that does not come home with me uh try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so uh i i i grand school yeah but also enjoy all the things i did not get to do 

Recording: (2359/ 10721) 
i mean that goes along with my systems in my life i mean we are going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school and even my my husband is a um boy scout um leader and just listening to the boys there he he he did a program last night on respect 

Recording: (2360/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (2361/ 10721) 
it just columbus is getting to big for what it is i mean that is why you have high crime rate high population population is number one and uh i would say pretty soon if they do not cage it up a little bit you know just have enough for the area instead of people being homeless and you know jobless everything like that i mean i 

Recording: (2362/ 10721) 
i mean you have to draw the line somewhere uh but now you said family yes i think the reason that it always looked like everyone was born and everyone was loved by a father my father when they were little and how their former tv years are and the education the uh the way they were uh as they were growing up does help them to become what that president is what that any politician is any minister or anybody else it 

Recording: (2363/ 10721) 
now i had a cat that is just 

Recording: (2364/ 10721) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is worse things worse things i would think than than dying you know you you like i know when real the guy who killed vietnamese he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (2365/ 10721) 
my my my thing is is you still you know you try do your best on earth do the detriment you have whether it is supposed to be a missionary fine can you say a missionary working in the office there is need for missionary work in the offices around us on the campus everyday they are talking about their version here well you got to do just sit down you know what was done numbers game i remember skiing all just learn about one another and you are going to find out you know what i think they said the the clear blind society um that is how we got together 

Recording: (2366/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (2367/ 10721) 
take it 

Recording: (2368/ 10721) 
groups and different groups but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal jobs versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private 

Recording: (2369/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2370/ 10721) 
no because i think there is the ideal and everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do to and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now um i mean i could never umhum 

Recording: (2371/ 10721) 
yeah unfortunately well some people have to i mean you know the police officers and whatnot they are required to carry a gun but um almost every i know that has had a gun even if they keep a gun hidden here and the bullets hidden over here

Recording: (2375/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2376/ 10721) 
well that is competition to be earliest and the the federal government is trying to stay out of the state is face and so again it is another one of those things that just live with it i mean there is enough there is enough things to do in fight and worth life that that is not worth it you know 

Recording: (2377/ 10721) 
so the state would pay for it 

Recording: (2378/ 10721)

Recording: (2382/ 10721) 
definitely definitely 

Recording: (2383/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2384/ 10721) 
what is the difference way when i was a kid you did not want to be barred home by the police you are actually scared of the police nowadays what is the kid is scared of nothing 

Recording: (2385/ 10721) 
well  we had a diamond jude lee at the village and and coleman and peter both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i did not think that there was much that much difference in them idealologically i think you know she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but um i in terms of having a black mayor i think that is good for columbus i think 

Recording: (2386/ 10721) 
play with him take him in on the kitchen floor so we can run around because our kitchen is like open 

Recording: (2387/ 10721) 
and uh tried to get my family in it with some success not talking about as much as i would like but uh i think they are all responsible well adjusted people and have families of their own i have nine grand children one great grandson and uh and the boys are all on the sheet all day too so one of 

Recording: (2388/ 10721) 
one of them and i am like what he says uh he says we look at two two children sitting side by side this one is making straight as this one is sort of made but that is what over here got into track when he or she was in freshmen and and we noticed every track we they basically were were like last or second to last but they did it for four years then they 

Recording: (2389/ 10721)

Recording: (2390/ 10721) 
okay  

Recording: (2391/ 10721)

and she said she would get back to me on it well i have never heard nothing from her and she is done that to me i do not know how many times 

Recording: (2393/ 10721) 
i think so i mean there is enough open minded people in the country 

Recording: (2394/ 10721) 
well that is secret heat 

Recording: (2395/ 10721) 
it is hard 

Recording: (2396/ 10721)

Recording: (2402/ 10721) 
took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really would liked it and that was what i had been wanting so so that is how i decided 

Recording: (2403/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (2404/ 10721)

Recording: (2413/ 10721) 
continue maryland 

Recording: (2414/ 10721)

Recording: (2416/ 10721) 
i was not born here but i was raised here 

Recording: (2417/ 10721) 
um finish in high school um actually heard about a program where you can finish college on the internet

umhum 

Recording: (2422/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2423/ 10721)

Recording: (2424/ 10721) 
need 

Recording: (2425/ 10721) 
i think for the most part of people can handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more white like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone not at the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (2426/ 10721) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (2427/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2428/ 10721) 
it is like an advertisement for it 

Recording: (2429/ 10721) 
how how long have you been here

i had the same thing happen to my kid i i smack him one time 

Recording: (2431/ 10721) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (2432/ 10721) 
yeah um and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed they are on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working as a freelance for today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (2433/ 10721) 
you know a a check magnet

Recording: (2439/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2440/ 10721) 
bye

yeah 

Recording: (2446/ 10721)

oh yeah yeah what religion are you  all that one it has all those the going rules that work out in real life christianity  do not you 

Recording: (2449/ 10721) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not going to condem them um at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out maybe that child um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort 

Recording: (2450/ 10721) 
and and she is very determined uh she had said that having this being pregnant and having this baby is made her focus on things a lot differently she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (2451/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2452/ 10721) 
there was an indepth story about that i think it was i do not know it was harper is magazine or what it was any uh a significant magazine where they had uh made a study all the new york situation and now i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh as a matter of fact when it ever was i remember sending it in to the uh city council uh of of dayton i just addressed it 

Recording: (2453/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (2454/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2455/ 10721) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that 

Recording: (2456/ 10721) 
you know i am not real up on everything that is been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you and you would be able to say you know this is what there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of and and i do not i just think people kind of lodded on it and say well this is it is like this you know uh well we will see what we can kind of do about it and then we will you know 

Recording: (2457/ 10721) 
everything and i come back and you know where my parents live there were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know just like giant hey mart land you know i mean it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i had grown up with you know america my whole life and you know not that i sort of change completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like caverness places and like just the other day my friend took me to eastern and i 

Recording: (2458/ 10721) 
that is parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyed my husband said i i want to let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i want her to come home the other well the bottom line was sterical because she and this little boy they are outside and he they are jumping and he is jumping on the trampoline and i go out to him and i herdo myself and i say you know honey i said really sorry about the plants but i just you can i just could not let you let her stay there that long he goes oh that is okay my mom would never let me do that so i was thinking you know here is all everybody is acting like i am the bad guy and 

Recording: (2459/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah like i knew uh like a lot of people who who lived down on campus i used to live down on hudson like over the summer before i went to usu um so i mean i like campus and everything it is just like oh she was different than campus yeah 

Recording: (2460/ 10721) 
yes um i never read it 

Recording: (2461/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2462/ 10721) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like they said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like research things like that where saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condem it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (2463/ 10721) 
to her two children so she is become very active in the adoption procedure in tulsa and uh 

Recording: (2464/ 10721) 
before they you know ever run the place 

Recording: (2465/ 10721) 
actually i wore out 

Recording: (2466/ 10721) 
so you know one day um it was a really bad day i would gone like tolkien with somebody and came back and you know i like i said i had had anything to eat the entire day and i it was like it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i am too hungry you know to i am too tired and hungry and i just i am i am not making anything so i just went to bed and uh a guy knocked on my door which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he told me well you are in there and i would not answer well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punched the 

Recording: (2467/ 10721) 
yeah i yeah for them to go to a day yeah i would think it will for them to interact with the kids more yeah but where he goes there is he is got his cousins and stuff with him so 

Recording: (2468/ 10721) 
right she is won her last year 

Recording: (2469/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (2470/ 10721) 
well it would have been something that they would have supported and something that i would have probably been pretty good at 

Recording: (2471/ 10721) 
whoa 

Recording: (2472/ 10721) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough the oldest or something you know an instrument like that um but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for less a few rehearsals umhum so we sort of have stringers i guess you would call them yeah we have actually 

Recording: (2473/ 10721) 
had to pack it up 

Recording: (2474/ 10721) 
that she does not have any power to do um and about how how they just continue to get raises and they are and they are not doing very much about it and and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police cards and and a lot of people are are doing dust jobs and those types of things and i i guess a lot of people just are not very happy with the job he is been doing 

Recording: (2475/ 10721) 
how many people want that 

Recording: (2476/ 10721) 
in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said for one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury 

Recording: (2477/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2478/ 10721) 
well and and the ambiguous part of it you know just say and try to be protective of the ways 

Recording: (2479/ 10721) 
yeah well like i mean high school has always been really easy and like and like high school is really easy like i never really felt like challenged even remotely by anything like i mean you know it was it is so like high school is kind of like a joke you know it was real fun and everything you know just to like not really have to do pretty much of anything you know and like um and like so college is a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i mean it is basically the same thing in high school you have less time to do the material you know so it is just like as opposed to i mean three weeks to doing the paper and 

Recording: (2480/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2481/ 10721) 
i was there for almost a month did one of those tours where you get on the bus um and did the london and the france and the italy and the holland and 

Recording: (2482/ 10721) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (2483/ 10721) 
she wears high heels why would she wear high heels  

Recording: (2484/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2485/ 10721) 
uh  

Recording: (2486/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2487/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (2488/ 10721) 
i forget the name well i do not think there is a university of portland but there is two two or yes there is a university i can not think of which one it is right now speaking of opinions did you see the paper today about the thing in seattle they are having this speaking  

Recording: (2489/ 10721) 
that is pretty good never had to borrow any money never went on welfare did not i think i was on food steps or something for a month 

Recording: (2490/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2491/ 10721) 
yeah yeah umhum 

Recording: (2492/ 10721) 
you lose sight of that i think you know what i mean and a lot of those guys become real egotistical i mean i like my uncle and everything but 

Recording: (2493/ 10721) 
does not that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me me me now and therefore they are really doing so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 

Recording: (2494/ 10721) 
our dorms are cleaner 

Recording: (2495/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2496/ 10721) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (2497/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2498/ 10721) 
i mean it is really bad these days 

Recording: (2499/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2500/ 10721) 
it is kind of like uh you go to a private school and you get there maybe seven years old on up to fifteen sixteen and at sixteen they can actually determine give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and sixteen fifteen sixteen year old kid actually graduated from college and they have yeah they have they have showed that study already 

Recording: (2501/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2502/ 10721) 
uh i was over there for a couple weeks in the harbor i never sat foot on land 

Recording: (2503/ 10721) 
i would work the fourth 

Recording: (2504/ 10721) 
it is like big deal you know common sense to hot you do not put it in a sensitive area while you are driving to work um but she is sued for ten minutes and the paper said she won ten million she did not i mean after that ten million award was given by a jury then uh mcdonald is allowed a and a appeal at the end of the year so she does not see any money for a year and that is if they do not appeal but ninety percent of these big corporations have 

Recording: (2505/ 10721) 
and you know just sometimes it is just like they are like oh well she could not understand or something like that but for the most part i they are you know no weirdness he is had he had a few cousins you know make some little comments but 

Recording: (2506/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (2507/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (2508/ 10721) 
nailed over it instead of replacing the door so 

Recording: (2509/ 10721) 
uh about twelve 

Recording: (2510/ 10721) 
kind of 

Recording: (2511/ 10721) 
um pretty good he liked it a lot but it was a big change from the catholic school big change uh he liked it a lot i do not know if you are familiar with fort haze it is a um it is a college prep um um they call it an alternative school it is called baghdad school in most places uh it is it is college prep with an emphasis on the arts and there is some career programs there so it was a good good for him 

Recording: (2512/ 10721) 
we had uh my husband and i had just some herbs you know parisly and chives and some basil rose mary that type of thing 

Recording: (2513/ 10721) 
oh yeah it was like whoa my head was like oh i got to figure out how to do that it was like you can not do that i was without yeah he he broke into like oh my god i can not remember what it was but he had all these numbers for credit cards and he was threaten into to sell them on the internet 

Recording: (2514/ 10721) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (2515/ 10721) 
i think people are still fairly racist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame and the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both white and i guess any other rich relations fault uh i mean as far as like if you look at the black community things like that you have like beetee um you have like the united states college fund things like that 

Recording: (2516/ 10721) 
oh yeah i would have to work shift work yeah so 

Recording: (2517/ 10721) 
that was the two worst 

Recording: (2518/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (2519/ 10721) 
yeah it is going to have to be from the bottom up i think and everybody keeps and i i am just getting a kick out of all the investments and everything they are coming with two thousand on it so i am hoping people are making a big deal and making a big investment in selling a lot of stuff because of it but i am hoping that it does mean people since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope uh y2k i do not know what that really stands for  oh  

Recording: (2520/ 10721) 
no not really um all my good friends from well i would say like out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two of them are still here 

Recording: (2521/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (2522/ 10721) 
and i could not be part of a veterinar practice that uh did that 

Recording: (2523/ 10721) 
you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know thirty year old boy who was interviewed with saying oh you know he would you know slept with like ten girls or something and i was thinking oh my gosh you know and he is thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is 

Recording: (2524/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (2525/ 10721) 
yeah i i was really glad that my son uh met you know was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because uh you know the guys are real real nice you know very it is very you know he is always kind of been like real sound offish when it comes to uh 

Recording: (2526/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2527/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2528/ 10721) 
and i mean it is it is a easy to spell it is easy to say and you know you can children it to m or 

Recording: (2529/ 10721) 
so it is still just sitting down on my computer so it is next to it um the only thing it is take it down you can only have half a dozen 

Recording: (2530/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2531/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (2532/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2533/ 10721) 
now that i do not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concept he will usually answer the and stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a sierra be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a he does work them out uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is 

Recording: (2534/ 10721) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things and little children is minds and even you know like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence in when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were allowed to watch it but you know i mean i mean the comics were not violent um now which is too open for kids the parents you know they say the parents are 

Recording: (2535/ 10721) 
you know you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you work two two hours a day you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so 

Recording: (2536/ 10721) 
stuff done you know and i do not know if it is if it is just because you know you have to get agreement from all the other all the everybody else in government before you can pass anything or why you know why do not these things get taken care of i mean there is so many different issues that people want to look at and you just end up focusing on things like philip morris you know which is like that i guess thing in the whole world you know no and and there is so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are that are important i just i do not know maybe i mean i do not i do not 

Recording: (2537/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2538/ 10721) 
he left her there and i they said they called me but i i was around the sleeper sitting on the phone so left her there and he said that she was going to call back you know at at a certain time and i was going to tell her what she could or could not do so i said you know we are going to have to come home you know and he is going to have to come and get you all come on no we are not going to do that i you know you can not be this late so he went back back down picked him up and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (2539/ 10721) 
yeah they will not bother it 

Recording: (2540/ 10721) 
yeah it is been one time every year 

Recording: (2541/ 10721) 
so that like that is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (2542/ 10721) 
you know and these schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a um excuse me people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know and checking everything and 

Recording: (2543/ 10721) 
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that had been kept up 

Recording: (2544/ 10721) 
i i i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (2545/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (2546/ 10721) 
in general i guess in the summer time uh that is the way it was when she was going to school uh now you know with her going to school like like at uh saint louis uh i guess it would be that way 

Recording: (2547/ 10721) 
definitely so my daughter definitely because she was working for camp scouts or even craze and she came home one weekend from uh oxford and uh 

Recording: (2548/ 10721) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals some things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged to him but i decided to 

Recording: (2549/ 10721) 
it is been it is been remarkably well i mean i have not had any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and and i had a checkup and my doctor really thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultra sound well the thing is they did this ultra sound they did not find anything so which was really kind of creepy because they did not know there is that whole two well pregnancy thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did my altrushown was not my regular doctor and he is kind of well he he is just a little 

Recording: (2550/ 10721) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh not so much uh the the type of work that i do but i think she is very i think she is very getting very uh 

Recording: (2551/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i can not say that that would be any difference with them 

Recording: (2552/ 10721) 
convict white been of of killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (2553/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2554/ 10721) 
because i have seen things that are not physically possible 

Recording: (2555/ 10721) 
bad acoustics really 

Recording: (2556/ 10721) 
well yeah we got broke into i think twice and stuff got stolen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into the gas life and pretty much everybody around there is been uh criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (2557/ 10721) 
so the money is just kind of wasted 

Recording: (2558/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2559/ 10721) 
well when i was growing up there was not that much violence and i could go and end and i have done it now my name in on this report so you can not do nothing about 

Recording: (2560/ 10721) 
but they do not use some brothers i mean they just go through it they are just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket you know and because it is not a hard rate and the first year i there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there is no cold real cold winter and uh and then from july august soctone october is just gorgeous just so gorgeous but i like i like that fog and that mist and 

Recording: (2561/ 10721) 
the real um slap of the face for him so he was really mean after that so i laughed i just i walked out i picked the kids up at the bus stop and they are like mom what do you do i said we are going somewhere you know let us get in the car  so but um yeah just a couple of experiences like that though make you do other things so you know i stayed tough and i you know got other jobs and 

Recording: (2562/ 10721) 
but it is mind boggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking to whole high schools to football teams you know it is just mind boggling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a handful of people and do not know anybody else you know a lot more of a tight knit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (2563/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2564/ 10721) 
i that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not work that in ways that other people do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real a lot more temper we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things are not um even temperate or not things you would use to describe mean not but but 

Recording: (2565/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (2566/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2567/ 10721) 
very different  uh there just been a lot of innovations 

Recording: (2568/ 10721) 
um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever um just because obviously you basically may make your parents as far as what you do when you are young and things like that and obviously if you all had to male parents or would have ever obviously you might be thinking  more towards like dating guys and things like that um i 

Recording: (2569/ 10721) 
i do not know if it is where it is but i definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments and projects in the tunnel 

Recording: (2570/ 10721) 
her her little boyfriend who was the the captain kirk commander ryan or like stud persona i see in many ways uh i mean i i agree in deep space um big deep space nice and a revolutionary and i i thought in many ways she like completely broke out of traditional gender roles i also like 

Recording: (2571/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2572/ 10721) 
you know because you you are learning more about yourself and uh you are you are also learning more about like your experience and a lot of freedoms that you did not have obviously you know you are drive 

Recording: (2573/ 10721) 
i had three uh they are all growing up and have kids of their own i have grandchildren from that age  

Recording: (2574/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (2575/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (2576/ 10721) 
what they should do is just tell people that their kids do not get to go to school i bet the attitude change is pretty fast  

Recording: (2577/ 10721) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot a mean and what would be shoot that they would use it for they sometimes they i know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money did not have any food they just would not kill some animals and gave it to them and i do not have a problem with that uh uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charleston has to him tell us it 

Recording: (2578/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2579/ 10721) 
uhhuh uhhuh well and you know that song by itself probably if i just heard it once or twice that is okay  yeah  and she is an interesting character there i guess i mean i do not know everything about her but i i remember that she insulted the pop  

Recording: (2580/ 10721) 
 so and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because after all so much speaking up and they want to do things my no um 

Recording: (2581/ 10721) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack uh on the bottom uh with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know my the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and you know it 

Recording: (2582/ 10721) 
even though my kids are not there they will stop by my house just to say hi 

Recording: (2583/ 10721) 
oh yeah it is 

Recording: (2584/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (2585/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2586/ 10721) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfied in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there  whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument  i i do not think we ever got a is b is and c is  yeah 

Recording: (2587/ 10721) 
yeah right  

Recording: (2588/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2589/ 10721) 
because it is more open um and you count it in terms of civil rights um my boyfriend is thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against i he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent the way to do that as through you know talk can to them religion wise um i do not think it is as sin i think that um your sex quality is genetic based 

Recording: (2590/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2591/ 10721) 
than i 

Recording: (2592/ 10721) 
yeah two but that the more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is been because of a loss of up parent that you are in ability of up parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage that is got 

Recording: (2593/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2594/ 10721) 
yeah it is it is nice i think so well 

Recording: (2595/ 10721) 
especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (2596/ 10721) 
and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (2597/ 10721) 
you start thinking a little differently i think as you talk as you should be talking to some older people i am saying people in the in the eighties to find out how the progressive of life is and how you think because when you go to a state sales all you are talking about this proper motive person on the lines the quality of life is in the mind the person you are you you avoid it all the time 

Recording: (2598/ 10721) 
yeah but you just have to have something to go by and just as closely you know we have to just go with it you know i mean you can not go back and try to read the i do not sometimes somebody was trying to rearrange the calendar one time were not they 

Recording: (2599/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2600/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (2601/ 10721) 
is there the resentment to things like mcdonald is there too or if it 

Recording: (2602/ 10721) 
over that right and 

Recording: (2603/ 10721) 
talk about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can you know even have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child the really needed needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what jeans they might inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not  later on you will find out but it is still you can go back and you can find the parent 

Recording: (2604/ 10721) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe no i think it is a high school in marion we built on um an old weapons depot and so like leukemia is reason and so like that is their main campaign now is to informed the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things uh other uh did you anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (2605/ 10721) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to it yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to go off over effectively so when she said look if you are never listening to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe it is like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (2606/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (2607/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2608/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2609/ 10721) 
because we said now that he will need that someday i would never have done it 

Recording: (2610/ 10721) 
i hate my my last name was terrible i hate my last name 

Recording: (2611/ 10721) 
uh a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and as equally as independent then it might it might work but um i you know and he knows why each person gets i mean each one of them was in individual situation and uh 

Recording: (2612/ 10721) 
i was only about fifteen years old i am going like what the hell is this what is going on i mean i did not know who was president then but you know  i knew that there is a couple people 

Recording: (2613/ 10721) 
and you are like oh i am going to you know high school problem or something and that part is a little little awkward but i mean i can not say it it is really any different or anything umhum and today the used they watch tv and loose and they are all violent because they are going to be playing violent because they are going to do more than umhum 

Recording: (2614/ 10721) 
native american spiritual or religion for lack of a better word uh because our people believe in religion you can not uh you can not encompasses one word everything that is into one word 

Recording: (2615/ 10721) 
i have been delegate outside of the duties of the pretty but uh i still think that it is a good i do think the involvement of the layman is very important but i do not have any i i mean that does not bother me a bit about women 

Recording: (2616/ 10721) 
for months and months or years and still nothing was gonna happen it was the wrong time or we try to move on to something else uh and it is regretable it has not come back like you said it is like well i made the one attempt and did not know anywhere so let it drop and it is kind of for somebody else to pick it up well clinton is in laim duckets why can not you bring it back 

Recording: (2617/ 10721) 
nope to becoming uh a minority within texas instruments 

Recording: (2618/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2619/ 10721) 
right but still my my oldest daughter for a long time she was in in theater and people said how do you feel about that i said what do you how i feel about that you know she can always wait they came up with long as she could support herself what do i care and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology and now as it turns out she is going to um she just started back she is was having the baby though she just started back and uh to get certified to teach elementary school because we have talked so much about 

Recording: (2620/ 10721) 
to read the paper it is  yeah yeah like the five year old is addicted to the tarzan he likes tarzan movie that was out so yeah he wants to  we have kind of boy caught it in  the daughter wants to throw it away  never do not have to watch that again 

Recording: (2621/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2622/ 10721) 
well i am saying that 

Recording: (2623/ 10721) 
well when he first started out 

Recording: (2624/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (2625/ 10721) 
oh yeah it is got a unconditional love out there 

Recording: (2626/ 10721) 
umhum oh boy yeah it is it is a lot of work really is she is a a nurse and she works at the a cool center in the breast cancer department she is uh oh earner is she is worked here for twenty two years also got her degree at ohio state she grew up in dayton and then moved here to go to college and then stayed at ohio state after college 

Recording: (2627/ 10721) 
killed civilian because they did not um they did not decide to become a combatant so if you are if you are a combatant and you make that decision or you are drafted which that that is kind of like making this decision in the sense that you were part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose to be part of that society that i mean that is a little shadeier but still if you are if you both make the the desire to do it then so like fire draft and i think i would fire i am sure i would fight for the 

Recording: (2628/ 10721) 
um but now see and i would never you know you do not know until you get a reaction like that 

Recording: (2629/ 10721) 
smaller yet but once they get in you know in the swing of things it will be okay but you know you are you are talking a while you know because it is not something that you can do overnight but it would be like your dad learning the computer he is not going to do it overnight 

Recording: (2630/ 10721) 
yeah the procreation part of what marriage is all about but i see marriage as more than just propaganda 

Recording: (2631/ 10721) 
i think in fifth grade was the first 

Recording: (2632/ 10721) 
for amc is for um not getting hurt  she works at fed ex and um her crew is always getting hurt mainly uhhuh 

Recording: (2633/ 10721) 
so it is kind of hard you know what i mean to to do a lot of things 

Recording: (2634/ 10721) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (2635/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2636/ 10721) 
no i do not either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel taken a life like that leaving someone there just to die 

Recording: (2637/ 10721) 
yeah you know that is that is the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with with all the i mean and i am and i am so opinued and this too and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through i i see laders and i see colds and i see sears you look through and you say oh okay you know you are looking for things to buy well then you get a two whole two pages of women in braves and they are looking at the camera they are 

Recording: (2638/ 10721) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (2639/ 10721) 
my background 

Recording: (2640/ 10721) 
oh yes and i had four children four or three boys and a daughter uh the my son is old live here in columbia and my daughter is out in seattle in uh redman area sunday school all my life 

Recording: (2641/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2642/ 10721) 
yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always the dored mark half filled i did not vote for him though i think that was the worst thing because i thought he was a great republican and well but i think personally my coleman was good i i have met uh well 

Recording: (2643/ 10721) 
you know and when he can wrestle with them and all that right now he is just he sits there and when he cries he goes what is he want like i know go down the list time okay just wait for if he it is been three hours since he is had a bottle give him a bottle you know 

Recording: (2644/ 10721) 
oh it has you know your basic uh last resort which i like to go to last resort and sears and jc penney is and uh no i would not want to i have to pull ours to go to those stores but if they made some outlets over there you know that i would be happy with that uh there is just a lot of uh all are stores you know like victoria secrets and book stores and toy stores and athletic wear stores yeah well 

Recording: (2645/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2646/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2647/ 10721) 
and the damn thing they are scared of when all your kids we used to make zip guns we would take an ink take the pin piece out put a fire cracker in 

Recording: (2648/ 10721) 
and um 

Recording: (2649/ 10721) 
do you really 

Recording: (2650/ 10721) 
 yeah like like five hundred people in a lecture hall yeah 

Recording: (2651/ 10721) 
okay no i have not followed it really 

Recording: (2652/ 10721) 
so i think that those four kids at least among my grandchildren are getting pretty much at the same training that i did or maybe better than i i got uh my oldest son is two daughters are well they are good kids and they are smart kids but i do not think that they have the moral grounding that 

Recording: (2653/ 10721) 
they 

Recording: (2654/ 10721) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2655/ 10721) 
she is she is adorable how old is she in this picture 

Recording: (2656/ 10721) 
i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (2657/ 10721) 
it is just like your people you see go to church or walk out to church to see somebody sitting there at homeless 

Recording: (2658/ 10721) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (2659/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (2660/ 10721) 
right in there yep and i had friends that lived in um a cad 

Recording: (2661/ 10721) 
uh nation because of they are actual sitting down and hands on of course that is one thing these children like uh friend of mine she was pretty much i would not put her border line in illiterate but she did not know how to read or write 

Recording: (2662/ 10721) 
they like the oh they all like the people on crock of dials and deep and they just no they just like 

Recording: (2663/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2664/ 10721) 
western religions and i have listened to the joe was witnesses and and and then when i read in the book more it is just i that is a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really felt at home with us and that is why i decided 

Recording: (2665/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2666/ 10721) 
well let us see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then you know you should not do it 

Recording: (2667/ 10721) 
oh it is most of it is horribly liberal and they have always find some way to misrep present like uh kurdish 

Recording: (2668/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (2669/ 10721) 
it is going to be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off as their cats are sick 

Recording: (2670/ 10721) 
starting over means putting a new operating system on it 

Recording: (2671/ 10721) 
i do not even know what their holidays are i i do not know

Recording: (2675/ 10721) 
yeah there was you know there was no property 

Recording: (2676/ 10721) 
um i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun we will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their uh guns they are basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them 

Recording: (2677/ 10721) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (2678/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2679/ 10721) 
proct check republic um put a patch 

Recording: (2680/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2681/ 10721) 
it was not at the time but you live in 

Recording: (2682/ 10721) 
and to me you are supposed to earn your grade  

Recording: (2683/ 10721) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (2684/ 10721) 
oh gosh that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (2685/ 10721) 
 you always had 

Recording: (2686/ 10721) 
yeah my grandmother is from ireland my grandmother and grandfather both from ireland 

Recording: (2687/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (2688/ 10721) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (2689/ 10721) 
i come back and it you know 

Recording: (2690/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2691/ 10721) 
right um at the age that they were 

Recording: (2692/ 10721) 
right  

Recording: (2693/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like twelve and thirteen and they have been having sex since they were ten and it is just like  and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (2694/ 10721) 
but with kids and they are just so much more active at an early age 

Recording: (2695/ 10721) 
people that just uh really wanna teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people were not like even went into teaching at all you know but um i think that would help just making it more for like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grade it is like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more compulsive education is weird like being forced 

Recording: (2696/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2697/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (2698/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2699/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2700/ 10721) 
yeah i think i i just think that typically you see a lot of lot of places that are that are under construction and not very many people work either 

Recording: (2701/ 10721) 
and just because you are i mean i was not really uh an athletic i did play uh sports when i was in in high school but i was a dancer was not any good you know that is that is like other guys but whether i did or whether i did not you know it i do not i do not nobody picked on me the only i mean one time i got into it what with one of the uh centered in football you know the big old guy and then uh i am still about the same size but 

Recording: (2702/ 10721) 
i am from here columbus ohio yeah 

Recording: (2703/ 10721) 
um i i uh i do have our own taxes i really i keep thinking i must be doing wrong because it is not that hard everybody acts like oh this is such a big deal

well uh i i suppose  well i i decided that i was going to date a black guy and my my dad did not like that at all so he just owned me and so now he i am married to my husband and 

Recording: (2705/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (2706/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2707/ 10721) 
yeah that is mainly what happens is uh you get all the out of town bad stuff i mean just kind of absorbs like a yeah 

Recording: (2708/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (2709/ 10721) 
boring 

Recording: (2710/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2711/ 10721) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah i just am a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (2712/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2713/ 10721) 
just getting over there 

Recording: (2714/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2715/ 10721) 
she is pretty nice i mean she is definitely at least standable and 

Recording: (2716/ 10721) 
yeah most of them 

Recording: (2717/ 10721) 
that is what something like maybe you you need to the states 

Recording: (2718/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2719/ 10721) 
you know because everybody will be after i and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy 

Recording: (2720/ 10721) 
i guess that happened just here in town a couple uh a week ago or something like that you know where a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really you know and who is really is a fault and who is really is he is guilty i do not know uh i would like to of uh not to say they ever would have but if it one of the two that you had a columbine you know if they would have survived i would like 

Recording: (2721/ 10721) 
i think um the people who have already graduated they like to the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids want to go it it is just thought of it is a somewhat party school 

Recording: (2722/ 10721) 
oh definitely definitely well i have never had a dog and i have always wanted one 

Recording: (2723/ 10721) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take the medicine every day just like it is mine take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my possibly which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is uh some law that six people that if they were drunk or on influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case 

Recording: (2724/ 10721) 
i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support canada or canada b because the they will protect abortion rights that is going to divide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2725/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (2726/ 10721)

Recording: (2729/ 10721) 
um i think the fact that things like at responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know things as far as people getting pregnant and and then this person goes off and and be them you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and 

Recording: (2730/ 10721) 
he admits now that he felt neglected of that period 

Recording: (2731/ 10721) 
fliped me out 

Recording: (2732/ 10721) 
and move on maybe somebody else does and that is the way i am going to be you know and and like i said she can clean up and look like a beauty queen but you can also look just like you know just basically you know like she was breaking leaves ten minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect and i just think that is sort of shallow because you know i look at people who got you know they have to have their face lives and they got to have the perfect hair and they got to have the perfect clothes it is like you are so insecure about the 

Recording: (2733/ 10721) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones because every one of them is different 

Recording: (2734/ 10721) 
but uh everybody in my family is mechanically inclined

Recording: (2741/ 10721) 
no i think we are only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i have known from middle school and following them up and you know they just all go there different way like the one girl i was friends with out we were apart i mean she was a great lower than me but when we would seen each other in the halls say hey with something and and we would talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that and high school i did not know anything i i knew she was bad  

Recording: (2742/ 10721) 
 yeah that is 

Recording: (2743/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2744/ 10721) 
um  actually it is more it is almost like you turn into like selfbusiness um like you said it started out with my dad and the people would ask me what i and i tell them and they go oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and so i go there and they tell people and 

Recording: (2745/ 10721) 
we have to pay for that yeah oh yeah we oh yeah yeah we are paying for it 

Recording: (2746/ 10721) 
yeah i do not think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president they made some mistakes with their personal life 

Recording: (2747/ 10721)

Recording: (2756/ 10721) 
neither side is going to do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been do doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and uh so he knew you could get by with it 

Recording: (2757/ 10721) 
yeah they have the grapevine parade and everything which is good they should not be able to

i mean most men are dogs yeah 

Recording: (2761/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2762/ 10721) 
i know i was going to be there for a while i was going to say i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like you know you should get out before you actually fail the class  and um it was it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that is what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just um it is uh unwise and and whether or not it was worthwhile i believe that it is uh horribly worthwhile now and yet now i am not taking classes so 

Recording: (2763/ 10721) 
hi 

Recording: (2764/ 10721) 
see that is that is a difference uh worthington has a you know program for them uh one of the women that i worked with she was having so many problems similar to mine when her son was in um columbus schools and she moved to westerville and they put him in a class for that and it took care of it they had three 

Recording: (2765/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2766/ 10721) 
oh it is horrible  because you watch it and you think 

Recording: (2767/ 10721) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age too 

Recording: (2768/ 10721) 
just because it is been three weeks now you know and not only that there is uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and then you and you have to pay their full wages for the work but they they miss 

Recording: (2769/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2770/ 10721) 
and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not die you do not physically maybe you know there is no deny to that but spiritual not even physical death can break that that one 

Recording: (2771/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2772/ 10721) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him eitherized 

Recording: (2773/ 10721) 
that you really did need because then you could get more bang for your bucks 

Recording: (2774/ 10721)

Recording: (2775/ 10721) 
um well just even like the parks 

Recording: (2776/ 10721)

Recording: (2777/ 10721) 
if you read it to yourself out loud like if you are in a room by yourself and you read out loud do you remember it better than if you read it silence if you hear yourself say the words

Recording: (2788/ 10721) 
i got a bad heart i do not know what that would do to me 

Recording: (2789/ 10721)

Recording: (2796/ 10721) 
well i do not think they should be responsible but i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties you know the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they

Recording: (2806/ 10721) 
but it kind of helps actually because uh you have all the people in there who are not owners and they do not know how to like the partyingers they do not know how to study or anything so

you subject catholics and by by the old rules before the vatican and i think there is a new modern age of catholics so even if you say okay i am jewish or i am gay or i am african american or whatever i still think they are very they are still a person with different needs in once and what they are traditions and culture and family values are still going to be very different and you need to find out from that individual person what it is that they need 

Recording: (2823/ 10721) 
cliff public 

Recording: (2824/ 10721) 
within saying focus and she said well we can work with that well about halfway through the year she said it is not working and they have an arrangement with and i doubt if most of the people in the parents in the school are even where it is with children is hospital counseling said they set a room aside and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students it is open classroom deter mental says people coming and going all the time and no we were never aware of it i i doubt most of the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him 

Recording: (2825/ 10721) 
sure 

Recording: (2826/ 10721)

but eventually when away i just i i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy you know 

Recording: (2830/ 10721) 
my well nowadays i grew up my dad hunted and everything you know so we had boys had uh guns in the house and everything you know but uh you know i would no more geared go near one unless he was around because i i i was told not to you know uh uh and they they always used to say you know if you if you stop letting uh normal people get a gun and they are criminals 

Recording: (2831/ 10721) 
well personally i voted that the thirty three should pass i think they should the way i understood i mean they have ways of wording those things you have to reed very carefully and no whether you say yes or no one thing i suggest because i uh analyze it to say that they are repealing something that was past i think one or two years ago that was allowing things to be done up around the police area like new roads and this and that and i want that repealed because i do not think we should be helping 

Recording: (2832/ 10721) 
 keep them out public is hands until the right time but i think though all in all the solution would be get rid of the criminals well how are you going to do that  you do not know if somebody is a criminal until they do something for the first time 

Recording: (2833/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (2834/ 10721)

Recording: (2835/ 10721) 
kind 

Recording: (2836/ 10721) 
no i i never i never looked into that but that is a good suggestion uh like spanish instructors no i i never thought about that not until you just just uh just just that so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those here so i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes but i was like well i did not know that was like true not they could actually teach around

we were talking about this at work one day and i said you know i am surprised you think that way because i tend to be a little left of center on most things sometimes far left but and i said now this is not i she said it seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is that they do not want to go back to cuba not to the communist but people i have talked to even extreme conservatives and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that the ones i have i have not heard anybody 

Recording: (2904/ 10721)

Recording: (2940/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2941/ 10721)

Recording: (2952/ 10721) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it than what we will probably ever know um you know they are they are really having checked into the background of the parents you know as to what their beliefs were i think uh and i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidentally happening and where some kid shoots another kid you you know and and the parents are are responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed yeah

Recording: (3010/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3011/ 10721) 
i i think it is because uh when i i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on me that taba and flat b  any relation to this stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagram and um but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they are exposed to you know in movies and everything and you know just tv just daily life um i they are a lot more aware they they have i i they they go into it with a lot of of uh myths and 

Recording: (3012/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3013/ 10721) 
no no  

Recording: (3014/ 10721)

Recording: (3015/ 10721) 
and they do not i mean we have got two new uh stadiums and we have not got any increases in school for 

Recording: (3016/ 10721)

Recording: (3018/ 10721) 
way to go past your yuppo do it and we are going to cheer you on the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ that is the job of a christian and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what the original you know that is what the that is what christian is supposed to do and that is what our church does 

Recording: (3019/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3020/ 10721)

Recording: (3030/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3031/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3032/ 10721) 
they have honors classes which are separate and they are supposed to be better faculty and um smaller classes and a little more challenging 

Recording: (3033/ 10721)

Recording: (3034/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3035/ 10721)

Recording: (3036/ 10721) 
it was not public science to the to agree that it is now it seems like anymore nothing is secret i mean as far as the papers were concerned and uh that is something else that i i guess i am a old fashioned but i do not think we need all this publicity about all the sexual escapades so all the people that are notorious or have notorious lives uh 

Recording: (3037/ 10721) 
where she works and this is just the way she is breast cancer place so

well altogether i have been i started in ninety one that was 

Recording: (3041/ 10721) 
and fired him 

Recording: (3042/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3043/ 10721) 
yeah not that they could have stopped it but they they should have known what was going on i i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially if these kids are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways you know that they are you know going uh turning a different  you know i just i blame them though 

Recording: (3044/ 10721) 
but we go out and look at we do do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the the uh second world yeah we are 

Recording: (3045/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3046/ 10721) 
i do not even read it much  it is very conservative very republican yeah 

Recording: (3047/ 10721) 
and it is interesting that they advertise that when you go there though if you get that room that is what you get 

Recording: (3048/ 10721) 
you would sleep in three pairs of sweat so you would lose about two and a half pounds in your sleep 

Recording: (3049/ 10721) 
for something like that just for something to do 

Recording: (3050/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (3051/ 10721) 
so it would be like a waitress or or uh uh clerical 

Recording: (3052/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3053/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3054/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (3055/ 10721) 
would you do uh like oh god you know i feel like i was a parent before i was a parent you know i that is the way it felt like some of my friends like like this guy i used to hang up with he he is the run into walkers in high school and like that is so good 

Recording: (3056/ 10721) 
uh and he had been through a counseling experience before and it it he just played along with it then to get way out of it i think but 

Recording: (3057/ 10721) 
and uh it did not hurt may not you know uh i think just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you know at your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in a neighborhood even you know how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go cars we had many we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3058/ 10721) 
historically you know my dad is people were democrats but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed to turn republican i guess but uh you know there is there is some of the conservative values that are very important to me you know but then there is some social things that they are all important just so 

Recording: (3059/ 10721) 
no it was it was kind of disturbing actually 

Recording: (3060/ 10721) 
i make them do their webbing and get the rough draft started and then they can go to the computer because they i find they they are a little more creative when they get the think about adding pictures and what you call it publishing it when you get to the publishing stage 

Recording: (3061/ 10721) 
um i i had stuffing and there was a a paper they used to send to parents of students i think they stopped publishing that i had stuff in that um i have had some stuff in lately and i am working on football stuff right now 

Recording: (3062/ 10721) 
really okay i did not know i did not know there was like a ripple effect for australia i thought you know being so much you know 

Recording: (3063/ 10721) 
but they but then in the very next breath they said well in two weeks we are going to california to visit the mall now now and you know what i was telling you each of my children because i was upset and i was telling him this and they are all going oh mom you know my all the girls are going you know and my my daughter who is thirteen is fabulous she is so blunt she is such he is just so out there and so different from so many other children um and she said well do you actually care if he comes here you do not care do you and i said

that jerry who was it jerry springer or jerry somebody that is on there and he has 

Recording: (3065/ 10721) 
i mean you need me to 

Recording: (3066/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (3067/ 10721) 
watching it for a while period and then since d space nine left i needed a little star trek fix every once in a while so i started watching it i also do not have cable so uh it is on upn and fifty three does not come in terribly well so it uh i mean sometimes it is like uh i do not wanna kind of see what is going on but 

Recording: (3068/ 10721) 
oh that is where have you been  

Recording: (3069/ 10721) 
which i feel has been completely divorced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh i have inherited this world where there was of uh uh where am i going with this  um i mean the generation before has had like vietnam the protestors against it and i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before 

Recording: (3070/ 10721) 
so i i should i should really realize this parking situation but like i said i usually walk in and today i do not really feel like at um i am i am having maybe in about two weeks here i am really ready to get this over with 

Recording: (3071/ 10721) 
graph design in particular after i quit wrestling i got really into computers so i pretty much live on my computer now yeah 

Recording: (3072/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3073/ 10721) 
have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major you are bearing because i see the the total destruction of our center cities uh and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just city is the size of columbus which is which is the largest one to say to ohio now but i am talking places like washington courhout which maybe have fifteen thousand or 

Recording: (3074/ 10721) 
four four years ago i do not know it is been a while four and a half years ago something like that 

Recording: (3075/ 10721) 
 that i used to forgot that i found that that you are ever in that your library of pennsylvania and i keep saying and laughing and crying and i found that umhum now they are colonial 

Recording: (3076/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3077/ 10721) 
they just her she was drinking and i mean terrible alcoholic and very his his father was very abusive and they did not were not even married 

Recording: (3078/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3079/ 10721) 
there is some um foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding classes 

Recording: (3080/ 10721) 
you just keep going that is part of life you pick up something and you learn it and you keep going 

Recording: (3081/ 10721) 
and and that split second i was like okay he is gonna do this to me he is gonna do this to my kids 

Recording: (3082/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3083/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (3084/ 10721) 
um yeah across the street is a dental and a hospital so people were really loud down there 

Recording: (3085/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3086/ 10721) 
things all that maternal milk why can not you instead of getting off the shelf 

Recording: (3087/ 10721) 
feel very good 

Recording: (3088/ 10721) 
i got one sister 

Recording: (3089/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (3090/ 10721) 
well uh my uh grandmother was uh ill 

Recording: (3091/ 10721) 
um yeah about the same number 

Recording: (3092/ 10721) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (3093/ 10721) 
well i i starts with with allowing uh how there has two mommy is 

Recording: (3094/ 10721) 
and they are real hyper about like you know bad thing for people to do you know that that during getting the smoking there is not as strict about umhum 

Recording: (3095/ 10721) 
it kind of yeah  well i have seen worse so  um so and they are doing this i think it is called sitting reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and they do that for you know like five minutes first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (3096/ 10721) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked by arranging my life around her so that even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches um 

Recording: (3097/ 10721) 
motherly instinct towards you know oh now like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows i am like that one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (3098/ 10721) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times when you make an error and i tell you to turn one and you go uh you know there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back and go uh do you do you mean left or right there and i go he yes that is a direct turn left you know you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kind of goes a long way and the pilots the same way they are the most often 

Recording: (3099/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3100/ 10721) 
and uh he let me fire it one  one range but i got about fifty or seventy five from the what we were shooting  

Recording: (3101/ 10721) 
plano rome is my atlantic  

Recording: (3102/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (3103/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (3104/ 10721) 
 it is like we do not have one at home because we are worried and 

Recording: (3105/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3106/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3107/ 10721) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i am i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about you know i mean what is to prevent them from going to find out what some companies doing what research is now that is a that is a true on the web too is that you can connect it in somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you 

Recording: (3108/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3109/ 10721) 
i see uh 

Recording: (3110/ 10721) 
i did not know that 

Recording: (3111/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (3112/ 10721) 
so i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because 

Recording: (3113/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3114/ 10721) 
my gosh it is one of those that i like you know falling out of trees  

Recording: (3115/ 10721) 
you would not have even stopped he is sitting there going what are you doing with this guy and what is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested man he took my necklace tried to take my radio too and uh you know i kind of do that in there and make it sound bad but  that was on my way to work during i did not want anything bad to happen to me or m you know so on all the cop you know put guy in handguns put him back the car he goes well do you want to press charges 

Recording: (3116/ 10721) 
um i am a luther and and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3117/ 10721) 
well my son started uh yeah his son started in public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social let us see he is the one that talks too much  as a teacher say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs the time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little there was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play 

Recording: (3118/ 10721) 
this it is it is in a t shape and the side of the building all the sounds just rolls right up the wall and this trash truck makes so much stinking noise it is ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i did not i i developed uh i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that is that is uh one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because because there is no noise there is 

Recording: (3119/ 10721) 
so it it is been very difficult for us to particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was between the time my fatherinlaw died my motherinlaw died which in the five month periods and my wife is had an awful lot to deal with um and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (3120/ 10721) 
yeah uhhuh 

Recording: (3121/ 10721) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to um enforce that so 

Recording: (3122/ 10721) 
hopefully 

Recording: (3123/ 10721) 
it is just 

Recording: (3124/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (3125/ 10721) 
reason to vote against them then if any big issue comes up that is just gonna be added to everything else and what you need to do is after you have this meeting with them has come out and and that he is doing a good job that we are moving along steadily and and i you know i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means um i made that mistake when i was president of the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all 

Recording: (3126/ 10721) 
no  actually i was uh going to get my ged after that 

Recording: (3127/ 10721) 
i know exactly 

Recording: (3128/ 10721) 
yeah and and everybody is going to associate with the people that they feel comfortable with so you know and fortunately as that guy this guy in particular is a center for the football as he grew up older you know uh you realized that he was not as big as important as he uh he blew out his knee for uh oh you you know uh by which i went to school with larry hunter who is the uh basketball coach for uh ou now and uh yeah 

Recording: (3129/ 10721) 
no then you would not be too familiar with everything 

Recording: (3130/ 10721) 
not the neighborhood thing as much and you can not let them run around as much as we did we you know we rode our bikes every way we rode to the pool we rode down to the and now you are scared to let them ride around anywhere because you are afraid they are not going to come back you know and so yeah it is so many different things oh that was not bad it was 

Recording: (3131/ 10721) 
we are still working those problems out yeah 

Recording: (3132/ 10721) 
right  

Recording: (3133/ 10721) 
get get like more of a respect but like it is just like like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like in uh especially in have lessons too like really influence like how you are as a person and like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subject you are going to hate that subject you know and like if you have good teachers you are and i love it i mean it really influences too like how like what you want to do with your life you know and people do not really acknowledge that too much 

Recording: (3134/ 10721) 
or take me to court again you know they got the money i do not 

Recording: (3135/ 10721) 
yes and no i mean in high school there is a bunch of little things here it is not so much a lot of things 

Recording: (3136/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3137/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3138/ 10721) 
it is just 

Recording: (3139/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (3140/ 10721) 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the the girls should were both of them should love their bodies and not you know give it to a boy that you know fallen all over for you and your you you feel all goodness and that you should respect yourself and love your body and you know do not let do not give yourself to somebody just because your feel in you are feeling good um and the boys i should  the boys need

i do not know like i think i think uh high school in general like that people always talk about raising the standards you know for for high school things but um i think um it is kind of like it is it is really hard to to like i have thought about before just what is wrong with like the education in system in general like i do not know i think it is more of uh more like uh it is college is a little bit different i guess but it is more of like this whole like 

Recording: (3148/ 10721) 
umhum

there is no need to attack students over it and i have read some article in the landry and i do not know why i read that but um i hate that paper but anyway um i have read some the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get a noise so they will go fine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment and 

Recording: (3170/ 10721) 
now that is part of the reason why

Recording: (3188/ 10721) 
now you will hear me wait too much 

Recording: (3189/ 10721)

Recording: (3192/ 10721) 
or ohio yeah i think yeah  i am not really sure i know they are from maryland that is it yeah 

Recording: (3193/ 10721) 
but you understand what i am saying it is you are going to have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to concealed 

Recording: (3194/ 10721) 
yeah you know that is pretty much what we have made to do you know back in the pioneer days you did not have this crap with the kid going you get fixed me some canned ravioli or  you gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his own that is an interesting thing i just saw in the paper in the newsweek i was reading that and 

Recording: (3195/ 10721) 
like trying to cram organic into my head and 

Recording: (3196/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3197/ 10721) 
do they have like these big lecture halls over there too 

Recording: (3198/ 10721) 
you know afraid we are going to get them addicted to the internet or you know because the nintendo and those type of things are bad enough they are a good babysitter but you you need to limit it 

Recording: (3199/ 10721) 
a little bit yeah 

Recording: (3200/ 10721) 
i have never i have never known of him 

Recording: (3201/ 10721) 
which was i do not see what those guns are of art with weird within ten ten yards was a hit was a talk and because if you had one of those things thirty seven pounds of t n t golf within ten yards of it  

Recording: (3202/ 10721) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (3203/ 10721) 
um does not just because you send does not mean you are going to how 

Recording: (3204/ 10721) 
well yeah and yeah my and my my daughter is the opposite so that uh but he would do that and so he was not he was very he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble and it is like i i do not know we would be told he was problem but he did not understand what was going on and there there was not a structure he would go to school every day and not know what to expect because there was not like this we will do this and then 

Recording: (3205/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3206/ 10721) 
that is why they had such little showclives i guess when they could lock in  you mean when this you hit when this hit your head i would hurt  come because the cold college 

Recording: (3207/ 10721) 
hum and bleeding so we had to go back to the hospital and and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was and this was not unusual it was it was a horrible period and uh i think what made my wife and i the angryest was he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (3208/ 10721) 
oh no no no no i mean she is a she is a great person she is a good christian but there is some things about her that i would not want in my life  x now and that but um i have been single since uh probably march and i am probably going to stay that way for a while mainly because i do not like anybody nobody likes me i i get that way i do not 

Recording: (3209/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3210/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (3211/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (3212/ 10721) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because of because of the drug and alcohol they will not put him on some of the medications so but as far as i can oh he is been pretty clear and clean on that and uh you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taken very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to the psychologist and uh uh we have been paying for him but we do not have a problem with that because he is smoking  he likes the 

Recording: (3213/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3214/ 10721) 
oh yeah i have no idea  

Recording: (3215/ 10721) 
like that word of italy people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting rovers is weight and not and in protecting choice you know i um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and that if you want to protect that right you have got to 

Recording: (3216/ 10721) 
and it is like i i like how check i thought about going to a&m but it was it was real expensive and like um i do not know but just because the and and schools more of a nontraditional type where they give you like evaluation and you do not get grades like and so so then it that is what that is what i heard like in india where the professor writes uh a couple page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that and that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved and noticing what 

Recording: (3217/ 10721) 
umhum yeah yeah 

Recording: (3218/ 10721) 
north and mall 

Recording: (3219/ 10721) 
because they kicked me out for some dumb reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking a blame 

Recording: (3220/ 10721) 
part of the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with on that said america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is a america love it and fix it just 

Recording: (3221/ 10721) 
no not at all i would have either voted for mccain over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which i am not saying he is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like everything is been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if he did drugs okay everyone 

Recording: (3222/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3223/ 10721) 
start watching and got i i do not want to say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the paint i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective uh so it was like my first couple of years and years of college from sort of the second half high school to the first couple of years of college i just sort of 

Recording: (3224/ 10721) 
he has different levels of things that people need at different ages and things like that and you know and and at at forty you you think wow you know and you really need to make a difference or do something and and i can see that because i have gone through all the phases that he is talking about so 

Recording: (3225/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3226/ 10721) 
she will be nineteen september 

Recording: (3227/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3228/ 10721) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are gonna have a a great time with your kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have but like this it is worth it 

Recording: (3229/ 10721) 
um actually i guess it is something that is always sort sort of been there i have always been real big on just building things i mean been real big hands on and last summer i helped my dad uh put a garage under his house um like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything like so what everything up from there and it turned out really well and i mean it was really fun to do i mean it is i like it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time 

Recording: (3230/ 10721) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (3231/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (3232/ 10721) 
uh like uh say going to oregon or they will you have to call for release times to these different airports and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like at twenty seven past the hour so he they know by looking at the tire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is air that causes themselves it is like uh you know like you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room uh ten oclock today well rather than say 

Recording: (3233/ 10721) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like the design um maybe the designer but you know like i went to uh i i was in police i uh law enforcement 

Recording: (3234/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3235/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3236/ 10721) 
uh so there is always something going wrong with the wiring or the plumbing or the something and uh it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house that the older house and the and no not anymore  

Recording: (3237/ 10721) 
you know he says that he equals nancy square and i say it is the equal nancy cubed because the world is three dimension it is not two dimension uh two imagine limits everything but you look at his stereo relatively all of our mathematical theor physicals on physics and things of that nature they have been based off that 

Recording: (3238/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3239/ 10721) 
plays and like like just things that are different and like my sociology and psychology teacher were were he was the same guy taught history and he was real good too like it was really um it is easy obviously but like it is just like interesting um like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about it you know just 

Recording: (3240/ 10721) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3241/ 10721) 
right right it probably went out of business when he left 

Recording: (3242/ 10721) 
it was it was supposedly it was my job but  as you know the parents always get stuck  i have a brother 

Recording: (3243/ 10721) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like  

Recording: (3244/ 10721) 
um i guess that would be slightly different part i am not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (3245/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3246/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3247/ 10721) 
oh boy they are just really fun people to deal with 

Recording: (3248/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3249/ 10721) 
again it gets back to being in the home did your mother give you everything you wanted then she failed you did not she 

Recording: (3250/ 10721) 
you know so things have come a little bit you know better but um there is still such restrictions with women 

Recording: (3251/ 10721) 
so they are called 

Recording: (3252/ 10721) 
as much fun as it was the first time uh i just not 

Recording: (3253/ 10721) 
 right 

Recording: (3254/ 10721) 
and socially too i mean mostly eighty eighty and ld kids are emotionally immature as well so like the songs that their friends are listening to and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they are still acting like a fifth grader you know they are not interested in girls and they are still listening to music that younger kids would like they are just generally socially they mature a little slower takes them longer to catch up 

Recording: (3255/ 10721) 
uhhuh the watchtows yeah you kind of like you know look it up and say you know somebody is you know got their sides on me yeah because that is uh i can only you know that is like the world war two stuff you know there is like the remains i am sure if it is like if you get to see the wall it is like there i mean i am sure there is like that there uh uh the from what i understand it was like 

Recording: (3256/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3257/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (3258/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah i should not have to do this i am not responsible for that happiness of this family 

Recording: (3259/ 10721) 
and they used to have the laser lake show downtown but they do not have anymore um you know just even if you do one thing for you a month 

Recording: (3260/ 10721) 
uh i have i have uh you know there are kids in the neighborhood and the growing up stock and i talk to the kids too i there is a a girl that lives next door we talk a lot she just started at um everett the uh arts middle school 

Recording: (3261/ 10721) 
no i would not have 

Recording: (3262/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3263/ 10721) 
well i mean most of it was me going over it with him and just you know i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and you know just doing the things that worked for him as an individual 

Recording: (3264/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3265/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3266/ 10721) 
yeah and then when they did the blood test they found out i had hyper attention plus cardiovascular disease and i knew with drugs 

Recording: (3267/ 10721) 
there is so much negatives on the national news i do not know if that will just be bunded in or if people will associate that with columbus 

Recording: (3268/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3269/ 10721) 
but like if you said i we will have a bus service we will go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse me car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them a like does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you run three shifts you just you know here is a box of doughnuts and some milk or something you know and that does not cost the company that much 

Recording: (3270/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3271/ 10721) 
or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to make campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that 

Recording: (3272/ 10721) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are gonna have a lot of people who you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends but they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were yeah 

Recording: (3273/ 10721) 
yeah really that is awesome 

Recording: (3274/ 10721) 
it is it is kind of a fun game it is just strange because uh like we are on i came down in semester so there is still months where everyone was down here and now there is like nobody down here there is myself my two roommates and maybe a handful of like other people that we know so like the social aspect is like has has diminished a lot but that is still i mean for fun we uh play a lot of video games too like i guess you would think like the natural thing things you would expect from a college guy 

Recording: (3275/ 10721) 
um yeah uh two thirty five 

Recording: (3276/ 10721) 
seven and i am going bye  you have a nice day you know and i am still sleeping which is right now is really good because i have a hard time sleeping at night and after he leaves it is wonderful because i can sleep until about ten thirty and i feel a lot better 

Recording: (3277/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3278/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (3279/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (3280/ 10721) 
i retired about uh four years ago from this state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i was in school here i worked here and that those five years kind of towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then uh last uh about the last two and a half years i have been working at the symphony and uh boston started parttime and then it was full time for a while and then i requested to be cut back to parttime even because uh 

Recording: (3281/ 10721) 
and i have got friends that do that and i just i do not i do not feel right i do not want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff that is no way huhuh 

Recording: (3282/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3283/ 10721) 
 you do not mind  

Recording: (3284/ 10721) 
for about seventeen or eighteen years and just reached the point where i would had enough of it and i mean i did not want anything about it 

Recording: (3285/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3286/ 10721) 
gone that clinton was going to win just by being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and uh he said something about you know and i i can not remember how we got started on the topic you know just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um uh dole was too old and this is a young guy he was in college and i i knew there was there was a a sort of a shift people wanted someone with younger ideas and um a new vision they 

Recording: (3287/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3288/ 10721) 
i was up i was only on the old pie a few times but one time we had a uh second lieutenant up there who was very well virginia will i guess there is a good word of any 

Recording: (3289/ 10721) 
yeah  yeah  

Recording: (3290/ 10721) 
it is all out of stuff like that and a lot of 

Recording: (3291/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (3292/ 10721) 
i think the one of the things that we when when you are baptized is that you are really supposed to help other people to no like if if you somebody gives you a gift do you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear makeup 

Recording: (3293/ 10721) 
yeah so a new grandma  

Recording: (3294/ 10721) 
okay if all it is drink 

Recording: (3295/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3296/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those and my father would not allow it because uh it was integrated 

Recording: (3297/ 10721) 
you could argue both of those too but i uh i mean personally i would say that is just teaching them more than what they need to know i i i think that is a little bit too much 

Recording: (3298/ 10721) 
williams freshman year and ever single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny williams lose something expensive by the end of the year and i had my bike do not want will william will uh and the big one that i was going to mention was william will either grow in his face significantly or will go the exact opposite direction and i knew one or i thought what happened because on the type i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh 

Recording: (3299/ 10721) 
yes they do 

Recording: (3300/ 10721) 
so that is basically what we have been doing we have been progressing for fifteen years and uh i am probably the say that our agency is probably the only agency other than maybe this highway patrol we work all but i think i we are the only ones that have their own wire cable people 

Recording: (3301/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (3302/ 10721) 
when they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars that will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good good with it 

Recording: (3303/ 10721) 
it is really weird is where i live at i live right by right i do not even have city water and sewer i am the only one on my side of the street i 

Recording: (3304/ 10721) 
well that is the other thing there a lot of times they are good in the arts they are either an artist i have a boy right now that is an eighth grader that is painting a huge canvas for me for my living room because i have not been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture and he is enlarging it and painting it for me in his free time and it is going to go in my living room and i mean it is it is i mean he is really quite the artist and music arts um literature acting a 

Recording: (3305/ 10721) 
taxans son is and things of that nature 

Recording: (3306/ 10721) 
not in not in rome county is it minnesota okay okay 

Recording: (3307/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3308/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (3309/ 10721) 
and uh then it takes you know a while you know to get to another person and then i have become friends with them it is like for some reason i do not want to do that  

Recording: (3310/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (3311/ 10721) 
uh they uh stopped federalway funding uh oh issue that was the federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contract or you picked up and moved on and you know some people moved like to arizona and california and and i thought well since they only have like two and a half years until i retire and i really like colombo and i thought i do not want to uproot my daughters out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to poor columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (3312/ 10721) 
so like uh there is like a is there a large american population and say well i think i just well i just you know like you know yeah it is like cosby is father but sometimes you know just want to hang out with with your own so is you know yeah is there any colleges this time you know people from states 

Recording: (3313/ 10721) 
you know i did not realize because i just love peanut butter you know on toes and crackers i go home you know it is because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and that you know it kind of satisfied me but um this doctor took a couple test and um he realized it was the peanuts which i would never thought of that because i ate it for so long all my life 

Recording: (3314/ 10721) 
uh trying to figure out what else to tell you i have worked here at the university uh twenty four years 

Recording: (3315/ 10721)

Recording: (3316/ 10721) 
yeah frankly in county usually votes differently than the rest of at least the metropolitan areas of the state 

Recording: (3317/ 10721)

Recording: (3333/ 10721) 
it is made a little inconvenient when he lived in the uh the twin tower in the dorm because if i needed him to come home or something you know oh i do not know if i got to get it get to my car some kind of way you know

when i started dating it almost seventeen uh so no i think i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are uh um i i personally do not think a school can do it

Recording: (3344/ 10721) 
and that is what i am saying a tone and for sin it is quite a hypocracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door the church is a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sore drawn a dead native american and his feet and three more at the side looking on and fair now

Recording: (3360/ 10721) 
to work for that uh aspect we uh asked them that they wanted to go on um a project with the class so forth fine but you got to participate in it too will match you with what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them responsibilities they grew up with the aspect they learned by being around some older people uh which uh i think was good 

Recording: (3361/ 10721) 
yeah they well you know  

Recording: (3362/ 10721)

Recording: (3364/ 10721) 
it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like emission homes 

Recording: (3365/ 10721) 
but  when you can not grow much of anything on it it is 

Recording: (3366/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3367/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (3368/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (3369/ 10721) 
you know they all get uh sideline and side tracked by special private interest and that is that is a bottom line and it is sad but there is so i i choose not to involve my self and that as much as possible we ended up selling for 

Recording: (3370/ 10721) 
they do really okay 

Recording: (3371/ 10721) 
where uh where are you from you say 

Recording: (3372/ 10721) 
oh the party why i said i well he is already sixteen years old and i will wait until you are sixteen years old and you will be allowed to go to a party was by that time i will expect you to be able you know know what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and i know  well i will not give you any examples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try them swearing is one of my habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl 

Recording: (3373/ 10721) 
and uh you know mothers have to work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that uh you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on uh that needs to be restructured so 

Recording: (3374/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (3375/ 10721) 
no i mean like i said i think little kids are going to be little kids if that stuff was not on tv they are still going to act the same way they are still going to be walk around with toy guns things like that playing or whatever 

Recording: (3376/ 10721) 
so your office would be great for marketing take all those figures and add up and see as it adds up to a hundred percent and if it does then where are your goals i went to his office and he said oh i wish no problem no problem you can get that house i said a can 

Recording: (3377/ 10721) 
so i almost bought one um a a lot couple weeks ago in fact i went i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man who is it was for his mother who was near nineties in uh retirement was on ralph forest which is north and i made this this slow offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because uh the baby coming and we are going to be busy and i did not want to get involved in it and so i made this offer and then he kind of back 

Recording: (3378/ 10721) 
i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot it is i think it is just more because it is so different than like what you normally see or things like that 

Recording: (3379/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (3380/ 10721) 
oh i am telling you 

Recording: (3381/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3382/ 10721) 
no it is in the it is in the college but uh why it is there i do not know since of how they fit it in there but it is dealing  construction management 

Recording: (3383/ 10721) 
say people who are rounded from their home or their office you know and are reminded to go vote will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was as a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberto i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most it is important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school level and if you need a ride let me know we have got them set up for you 

Recording: (3384/ 10721) 
i went to ou for about three months but i was just got out of school you know and i 

Recording: (3385/ 10721) 
i think he really does 

Recording: (3386/ 10721) 
that is wrong for him to do that he you know he is a man and i would tell him god did not put too male in the earth and if he would choose to do that that that i would not hate them or dis own them or anything like that 

Recording: (3387/ 10721) 
it really does not look like i mean 

Recording: (3388/ 10721) 
at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play and i thought is he expecting uh to play this the solos or is he expecting hum  

Recording: (3389/ 10721) 
that is an embarrassment for a college this size 

Recording: (3390/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3391/ 10721) 
and that the the the people who who most face that lie are the supposed beneficialaries of civil rights legislation um so i mean civil rights was an a an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today they are are uh i mean i see a a growing movement of people who want to curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and 

Recording: (3392/ 10721) 
um actually oddly enough that is what i am putting in 

Recording: (3393/ 10721) 
tests yeah 

Recording: (3394/ 10721) 
and now they have the little tiny grape tomatoes that are so cute how often you see they are they are the size of grapes yeah they are darling 

Recording: (3395/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3396/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3397/ 10721) 
into the health topic right 

Recording: (3398/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3399/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3400/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (3401/ 10721) 
um i do not know because i have not got kept in contact with them i think i know of a couple that have 

Recording: (3402/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3403/ 10721) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefited a lot from it now 

Recording: (3404/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah so 

Recording: (3405/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (3406/ 10721) 
but as i said i went to summer school too and 

Recording: (3407/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (3408/ 10721) 
 so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the but he makes you know fairly decent money so you know she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild 

Recording: (3409/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3410/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3411/ 10721) 
you know there is things about my dad but and i were in a little of a with and and he i used to great and he is wonderful to me i mean my dad is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like what my mom had me he he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (3412/ 10721) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognized school so to agree from a house state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize because of the big it is a big big name asheland that would be more of a cell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credit but still 

Recording: (3413/ 10721) 
oh uh place on some land with woods and uh yeah water and things like that 

Recording: (3414/ 10721) 
right which is what we look like 

Recording: (3415/ 10721) 
if if you did not own let us say on a school living you you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent uh at least it it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord  uh and i i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing 

Recording: (3416/ 10721) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (3417/ 10721) 
oh lots of people travel all over uh you know i mean that is i do not lots of people do you know i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but i you know i i do tend yeah 

Recording: (3418/ 10721) 
middle 

Recording: (3419/ 10721) 
well i do not know the people that i see around uh you know they are grownups 

Recording: (3420/ 10721) 
better than us i guess  

Recording: (3421/ 10721) 
i know  i yeah i think i think that that we both just i think to collectively together i know jayson likes the name a little bit better but i do not know about voice names and i just well he said one like when i was about three months that we both really liked but that was not really names were not really what we were thinking do you about that 

Recording: (3422/ 10721) 
but it just depends on still goes back to who you are now 

Recording: (3423/ 10721) 
a lot of pool actually uh we go to a a bar called the outer end because it is cheap and it is fun there 

Recording: (3424/ 10721) 
the average was going to be ruined and she felt guilty about it  not really  not really i mean i was grading on it pretty much of a curve too i mean i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was that was attempting to do the work uh i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off and uh but in terms of a curve i had a is i had b is i had a few c is  yeah so 

Recording: (3425/ 10721) 
no yeah i feel funny that i am i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years since i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (3426/ 10721) 
yeah you you follow the script and that is real funny too like you know you get um they they listen to you like they monitor the calls and um you know they listen to you and it is like does she like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know set it in this way like if you used this or whatever you know and like um i do not know it is just real weird 

Recording: (3427/ 10721) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (3428/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3429/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (3430/ 10721) 
so yeah i think um as a whole we have all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary i mean we do not have the same belief system and anything anymore so it is kind of like oh jeez  

Recording: (3431/ 10721) 
texpelled 

Recording: (3432/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3433/ 10721) 
well i i am a meat eater so i make a lot of you know pork chop steaks and you know these two 

Recording: (3434/ 10721) 
so uh then the security cops were up uh above us and they were predominally black you know and i do not know what happened to something happened one time there was on a maybe people in our a whole uh platoon and movies all in the same barrels and uh some guy said something off collar to one of them or something like that you know and uh uh got kind of out of hand for a while but you know saying a guy does nothing really have 

Recording: (3435/ 10721) 
i forget they have like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so that to me is not that is not bearable and then i i so that that is one reason i would not vote for boy um 

Recording: (3436/ 10721) 
get their pillow at lunch and generally the long acting the time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time released and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to so they go back to the six hour or a doe said you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they are like to the lunch line and you know they just hate it yeah

Recording: (3439/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (3440/ 10721) 
and i think i did not do that for a long for a long period of time i have become very well off the line 

Recording: (3441/ 10721) 
um you do not have a choice but at the same time you do not right you do not want to suffer but you want to keep them but it is whoops whoops i hope i did not move 

Recording: (3442/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3443/ 10721)

Recording: (3517/ 10721) 
anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me up especially i mean i think you kind of have a different level of awareness when you are a mother and you are sleeping in the boat with your infant because 

Recording: (3518/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3519/ 10721) 
when

Recording: (3522/ 10721) 
um freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (3523/ 10721) 
well i am very much in favor of guns control very strong gun control uh i uh they just seem to be too available uh i have done some of the things that the schools are doing about it you know the kid that comes to school with a paper gun gets to spend it that is a little much but 

Recording: (3524/ 10721) 
oh yeah we have probably been five six times already and 

Recording: (3525/ 10721) 
and then the players said we are not getting any guidance from the coaches 

Recording: (3526/ 10721) 
what uhhuh is my father is or or my uh okay well 

Recording: (3527/ 10721) 
i love it when people come from out of town because then i get to try new places and i am way behind i need more company  

Recording: (3528/ 10721) 
it is available it is just whether they go and put forth the effort 

Recording: (3529/ 10721) 
oh yeah it is definitely weird 

Recording: (3530/ 10721) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3531/ 10721) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (3532/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3533/ 10721) 
computers i 

Recording: (3534/ 10721) 
three weeks and they go that is right so they take there is no excuses you know and it is it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because you know basically they say uh we are talking about china this week and uh on december the fifteenth we want to report on why chinese people do what they do you know it is like in every week they do not come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the out line 

Recording: (3535/ 10721) 
we were following his gee we kept going and we kept going and this other gee i and i were sitting in the back and i suppose they know that german pass worked  but uh anyway they finally got out we finally got out to where there is a bunch of ruined farm or for ruined farmhouse and farm buildings and so on and uh i said oh this is it so uh we there there were some ti is

Recording: (3537/ 10721) 
if they can not say it in three months they can not say it in eight months 

Recording: (3538/ 10721) 
i think they have tried to to bring the layman in to more of the the duties of the price but they are just like the concentration of the bread wind that that none of that has been sanctions they do not perform they do not uh uh they are not able to give the sacramento grace is for baptismg thes for what they do holy commune but uh extra much in not those 

Recording: (3539/ 10721) 
throw at you when you are when you are trying to share things with them but there is i mean there is whole there is whole lists of them and uh it is just a matter i mean i i do not i am getting myself to a point where i can go out and share my favorite other people i do not think i am ready to um because one of the biggest problems is like i mentioned with with the brother jet thing is undoing the 

Recording: (3540/ 10721) 
i picked up one kid he he had been in uh he was only about fifteen he was adopted and he ran away 

Recording: (3541/ 10721)

Recording: (3543/ 10721) 
she was uh married mother was a kind of a pre thinking it uh liberal but uh well she went out when she was in her early twenties went out to north to uh northers house is called one of those certain homestead i 

Recording: (3544/ 10721) 
to some extent yeah but to some extent now because see when i was in the service it was a different time 

Recording: (3545/ 10721) 
right well why do you have to do anything with it 

Recording: (3546/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3547/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (3548/ 10721) 
um yeah actually they just posted something on the in on the email today they have these old machines that used to be uh they are called three b twos and h&t used to run them 

Recording: (3549/ 10721) 
as it was jacobs sold to the northland mall anyway so it is probably going to be like a strip mall more or less 

Recording: (3550/ 10721) 
well that 

Recording: (3551/ 10721) 
umhum he was he did some assistant coach work at uh oh issue pro issue he really liked that um  

Recording: (3552/ 10721) 
move was 

Recording: (3553/ 10721) 
it is weird i i wish they would make it i do not want to say for well i think they do make it free um and i hate to say that but a little bit easier access um um because i do not think it will cause people to have more sex i think they are gonna have it anyhow so it would only be better and safer for them 

Recording: (3554/ 10721) 
where i live now i have lived there for eleven years 

Recording: (3555/ 10721) 
you can find it all over the place 

Recording: (3556/ 10721) 
umhum do you have that three people in fall quarters three people in spring quarter 

Recording: (3557/ 10721) 
and and read about it and so i mean i have to assume that it i mean it is an election year and 

Recording: (3558/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (3559/ 10721) 
oh it is some committee i mean you have to send them in to some place at the state of ohio 

Recording: (3560/ 10721) 
it is and i saw like one of my friends that works so hard to get an mit 

Recording: (3561/ 10721) 
and so uh as soon as my shop planned out that i could draw that or ninety dollars a month thanks 

Recording: (3562/ 10721) 
and there is regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region so they go down the list the first thirty and they call you know they write each one of them and say we are offering a position and you want it or not and you know some of the people have said i have been on the list for two years and i have a you know i have a job and i do not want it now you know so and then those people have to go to oklahoma city to the academy and go and go through a screening program which is really hard because at one time only forty percent of the people are making it through that 

Recording: (3563/ 10721) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (3564/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (3565/ 10721) 
which is kind of nice i can turn the radio on 

Recording: (3566/ 10721) 
yeah we have talked about some things that are you know the pop says this is what is and then for well that this is not what we think at home we uh boy uh should not do not have a sexism  we are we are much more liberal than that and 

Recording: (3567/ 10721) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general or family 

Recording: (3568/ 10721) 
it was not a huge shock it was not my first encounter with homosexuality 

Recording: (3569/ 10721) 
i have not i know until they had so many beaches i mean i know they had a good reputation you know for for like just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back from a hundred dollars yeah the place is terrible you know when the weather was bad you know that that people are people were rude and everybody is are there just said oh you got to go you got to go you know it is a long five that is well what the time time 

Recording: (3570/ 10721) 
yeah it is i like it 

Recording: (3571/ 10721) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school than you know just yeah recently i guess it was not in the biggest numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kids would die even more than and you know seven or whatever and i think that the media is just made it into something that they have glamorous it and some of the kids i think 

Recording: (3572/ 10721) 
oh that was a football game deal 

Recording: (3573/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3574/ 10721) 
have you really have you gone to see all the shows 

Recording: (3575/ 10721) 
and the pregnancy and all the unwanted children and everything like that um i just heard this week that in france they have uh that morning after pill 

Recording: (3576/ 10721) 
 but um um one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look from molly 

Recording: (3577/ 10721) 
well i have i have been married and uh divorced and my i have got an eighteen year old daughter uh they live in saint louis uh i worked at asian chemical for about thirty years uh in administrative management and kind of went through some bad times there and everything so uh kind of i i like calling working for myself uh because i work through the temporary agency you know i work when i want to and do what i want to do and 

Recording: (3578/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3579/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3580/ 10721) 
and they leave and you get either another ass whole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good 

Recording: (3581/ 10721) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (3582/ 10721) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (3583/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (3584/ 10721) 
this was something that i would have done on monday night 

Recording: (3585/ 10721) 
oh wow 

Recording: (3586/ 10721) 
but uh um well something is happening of course to the planet on uh weather patterns and uh there been having drought sonarigan which is so strange but when i was there it uh it rains from november through june it rains i mean they they they are they stay on the weather in the morning showers changing to rain and then they stay there  and it does have yeah 

Recording: (3587/ 10721) 
and you went ahead and did it so 

Recording: (3588/ 10721) 
like i know like i was a four year remember student council and like did that did not went that route in high school and i know we always tried to involve other people but like they would look at us and be like that is so lame i would never do it 

Recording: (3589/ 10721) 
yeah um i took one oh four during winter quarter 

Recording: (3590/ 10721) 
and too much prejudice there really is still and it is sad but it there really is 

Recording: (3591/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3592/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (3593/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3594/ 10721) 
and  that is pretty much the way i felt the whole day because i was just smiling on the inside 

Recording: (3595/ 10721) 
a fact to me and i can not say that 

Recording: (3596/ 10721) 
so i tighten this good cool perfect 

Recording: (3597/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (3598/ 10721) 
see tomorrow i mean hold them feel the warm of the body uh hear the conversation quietly other than uh hearing okay time to get out of here you know with a bigger rust to say but it was pleasant sort of remark these kind i can see a lab or i can write a whole book on that on this on the entry or quarters uh but it is these kinds of things they are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to 

Recording: (3599/ 10721) 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think the does that a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much insanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i got to do my own thing that is why i was not going to do i want to do my own thing start he says with the women is feminine movement  but 

Recording: (3600/ 10721) 
to this central family makeup just has to be communications communications as it is going uh it is a reverseable uh i i think it can be redirected in much in the manner she is speaking uh an and where does this start i think it has to start back here in first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to 

Recording: (3601/ 10721) 
but usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (3602/ 10721) 
back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he came back at ninety six and i said uh you know i thought oh i am going to have to worry about it he is never going to come to it so i wrote back and such you know i appreciate your other but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i could do and i did not even give him a time to respond because i just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (3603/ 10721) 
the trouble is he does not get wiser too much he is usually about forty years of age i am saying gosh darn i wish i would listen 

Recording: (3604/ 10721) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that it is being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything to over 

Recording: (3605/ 10721) 
it is very hard 

Recording: (3606/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3607/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3608/ 10721)

Recording: (3609/ 10721) 
all these little wanton desires because i grew up in the depression and did not have these things consequently i have got a dog collection the teddy bear collection an angel collection record collection your i would not believe a whole one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room but then the books i started when the kids were little because they did read at home and the libraries were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and the classical has kept the books and it is amazing but some of those grandchildren almost 

Recording: (3610/ 10721) 
civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an allusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect 

Recording: (3611/ 10721) 
do you you do that do you 

Recording: (3612/ 10721) 
it was columbus he went to uh fort haze 

Recording: (3613/ 10721) 
that is right  it is safe for a point of kids but it is true you know and and they really my mom really has worked with them to make sure that that they get into some programs that they and there is some things now i think that they are developing that they did not have before 

Recording: (3614/ 10721) 
one of the bathrooms right now is the jacuzzi um that is not really too hard but the hardest thing to do is electrical work i think it is just because it is more intimidating byebye 

Recording: (3615/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3616/ 10721) 
well i play actually in two orchestras in the symphony and in the orchestra which is an all amateur group but um it is it is actually there were times uh when i was i have been in that group for maybe seven or eight years now and there have been times when i have been in that group that have it i have thought it had a really wretched sound  because 

Recording: (3617/ 10721) 
yeah and but you know that is very i mean and and that is not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that is a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is important maybe because we have had it too easy my my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there was a king and queen and you know he had no right to vote so when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the 

Recording: (3618/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3619/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3620/ 10721) 
and i i would just tell the boys you know respect these these girls because they are going to be women and you know try to wait you know you know if you love this girl if you think you but it is real way till she could go through high school together and stuff you know it do not work but  

Recording: (3621/ 10721) 
oh projects were right for emphasis where i was designing the projects we first of all we had to find out what we had with the best year and as everyone should know even and as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the telephone company does not provide the service to you anymore well we had know what we had throughout the state of ohio and some eighty counties and uh wherever else the facilities we had and so we went on a scupper hunt 

Recording: (3622/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3623/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3624/ 10721) 
that is not enough uhhuh 

Recording: (3625/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3626/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3627/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3628/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3629/ 10721)

Recording: (3630/ 10721) 
like at at a girl things like that 

Recording: (3631/ 10721) 
well uh 

Recording: (3632/ 10721) 
his mother died um the week after we got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile without diabetes her dynasty age eleven and just over the years uh um ended up having open heart surgery and and make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse  it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (3633/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3634/ 10721) 
you know like i said he is great to me and and everything but i would not i would not want to be married to him 

Recording: (3635/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3636/ 10721) 
uh well i think only because i went abroad i had basically one extra quarter beyond four years 

Recording: (3637/ 10721) 
they are real happy and his kids are grown and they have kids and you know the families are really pretty big the immediate family just us is thirty two with our husband is wife is and kids yeah and then i have another sister that was married to a doctor and just recently divorced she is one of the ones that wants to stay home and how it is unfair you know like it was unfair nothing ever works and so um she is living in a house completely paid for by herself and lives out living a little bit of nowhere and complains how 

Recording: (3638/ 10721) 
oh did you come in 

Recording: (3639/ 10721) 
they are starting to line around you know and we were on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our first kids  and they called well are you still want to be on a list yeah we do not have any children but keep us on the list you know and it is like you say and there is three or four hundred kids in that day care it is a large day care but there is not a lot out there that is good quality you know i mean you it is scary and then you see it in the news uh uh they were abusing the kids you know 

Recording: (3640/ 10721) 
 i am telling you man it would not cut me slack for nothing 

Recording: (3641/ 10721) 
i do i do um art affairs 

Recording: (3642/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3643/ 10721) 
but it is not 

Recording: (3644/ 10721) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levys now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson and found that so many schools are you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizen you will not understand the issues you know but 

Recording: (3645/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (3646/ 10721) 
yeah i know it is good one of us yeah 

Recording: (3647/ 10721) 
uh one of my friends who had the apartment in arlington 

Recording: (3648/ 10721) 
gosh you know that is one of the things that i really you know when i read the paper i think wow what can you do it has to start there first you know and i think if um and i and this might be because i am a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to think like the government and that kind of thing those uh kind of um funds that are available for different organizations and they are all geared toward things that 

Recording: (3649/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (3650/ 10721) 
um i do more summer sports but um he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer literer i have really never had a job yeah and it is always been working with food or plant 

Recording: (3651/ 10721) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarian but there is some for public too 

Recording: (3652/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3653/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3654/ 10721)

Recording: (3655/ 10721) 
a 

Recording: (3656/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (3657/ 10721) 
it is like where i work at the only way i can get a raise is by being uh like the kids used to say a tackle tail squeal or whatever you want to call

Recording: (3702/ 10721) 
you can tell yeah i mean 

Recording: (3703/ 10721)

Recording: (3706/ 10721) 
both uh to one uh 

Recording: (3707/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3708/ 10721) 
she is she is wonderful but you but back then they were they were in the sixties and they were hippies and you know my mom is got long black hair and they are wearing their army outfits and their whatever you know everybody is got bell jobs and my dad is got like here down here and everything so they lived like seventeen thousand you for a while and we lived um like i set on summit until i was about three years old and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment 

Recording: (3709/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3710/ 10721) 
um i definitely i mean i have think i went to like kindergarten in a public school so i do not really know too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do but i know i mean as far as going a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that that i am doing now stuff already covered in high school right 

Recording: (3711/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (3712/ 10721) 
right that is good 

Recording: (3713/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3714/ 10721) 
and he was one just for one minute my mother taught me that um i do not stay i do not stay in him in the corner 

Recording: (3715/ 10721) 
true communism not as it was practiced in russia but uh where people uh share and uh share power and share money and equally but with the where we are in our evolution that we are not ready for it i  i actually i when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an attentional community which was actually crying 

Recording: (3716/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (3717/ 10721) 
 just like 

Recording: (3718/ 10721) 
sure 

Recording: (3719/ 10721) 
and it was threatening kids with it and so they suspended him 

Recording: (3720/ 10721) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i always think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalty that you run into for that um but but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids have the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (3721/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah 

Recording: (3722/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3723/ 10721) 
but republican again because of the way this has has played out i mean this is a republican a lifelong republican he says i will always now vote democrat because this was just so those stupid and such a waste of my my time the country is time the country is money uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you rather be really extreme right wing to feel other than that except here in central ohio  

Recording: (3724/ 10721) 
uh wetstone park they used to have a shelter house in the summer they had all team dances every weekend 

Recording: (3725/ 10721) 
kind you know we know but it is 

Recording: (3726/ 10721) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i am thinking i may get into that 

Recording: (3727/ 10721) 
so that is why i just figured right now i should look 

Recording: (3728/ 10721) 
one thing okay go ahead well i one thing um i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe lots of people do not is how columbus is grown up 

Recording: (3729/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3730/ 10721) 
car down here john may come from school i i gave him a dinner but i asked him to sleep off the porch now i will still give him as dinner but i asked him did you do there super front porch may not sound much but at least i am trying to teach him something and you you saw a lot of it down there and the and the people where we were done uh friday bird but uh it it is it is just those things you you learn and then there is other times when i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and 

Recording: (3731/ 10721) 
uh north end of the river side hospital 

Recording: (3732/ 10721) 
than front of everybody is face anymore as a matter of fact i am getting so i do not watch the news 

Recording: (3733/ 10721) 
i i did not see that part i missed that beginning and all i seen was the the chart and i was like whoa you know that that is one reason well i would hesitate to put my kind of clothes public just like um the day care 

Recording: (3734/ 10721) 
since an hour at the beverly across the street on the el avenue so um uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know he did not he never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i even spent this money i ever spent 

Recording: (3735/ 10721) 
that was a lot of old thinking 

Recording: (3736/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3737/ 10721) 
i mean 

Recording: (3738/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (3739/ 10721) 
well you know she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (3740/ 10721) 
and her family 

Recording: (3741/ 10721) 
is that right  i just i just love i just love those qualityers  i just see a quality i would go   is just like little teddy room he was bringing bring him bring him to your daughter say here he is got a little play baby he is he is your he is a baby rather for you  really do they oh it looks so sweet and cutlass you know it is like just like somebody you just want to take home really 

Recording: (3742/ 10721) 
yeah all my family still lives around me pretty much yeah 

Recording: (3743/ 10721) 
uh that i know of one that i work with on a regular basis he is got a master is degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weakest ones you know and it is uh 

Recording: (3744/ 10721) 
getting married having kids you know and having a nice place to live 

Recording: (3745/ 10721)

this falls the first time i will be sending my port full you know 

Recording: (3748/ 10721) 
we send them in and then the kids let us see the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the pay the scores back in may sometime and um some of my kids well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated 

Recording: (3749/ 10721) 
it yeah yeah 

Recording: (3750/ 10721) 
because i do not know it just was like if i get pregnant and i get pregnant that you do not know of what you really have to go through of having a baby you know because i guess i really did not care hey if i got pregnant and did not it did not really you know register in my mind that this you know not ruin but it was it will change your whole life 

Recording: (3751/ 10721) 
and she says it is amazing you can give these give people numbers and they immediately use them wrong they just do not know how to use them uh they completely misinterperty even though it is very clearly stated what they are doing and uh the newspapers do that a lot too 

Recording: (3752/ 10721) 
right right tremendous demand right now 

Recording: (3753/ 10721) 
they were telling fifteen or twenty of them in the row and i just kept a stone face that at one or two i did  smile but they were trying to get me to laugh and i would not but uh 

Recording: (3754/ 10721) 
 that is just ridiculous too  but yeah to me that is really weird i do not like i said i do not know what they are what they are thinking over their thought process what but i am thinking maybe it is just social because a lot to me our high school is real social 

Recording: (3755/ 10721) 
yeah and it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (3756/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3757/ 10721) 
um and had to deal with being welcome back into the fold of star fleet by being uh first officer on the ship but still had to balance his his new life uh i saw so much potential for uh interesting stuff with that but i feel that he is become just uh just another character to deliver lines for most of the episodes they have seen from this 

Recording: (3758/ 10721) 
there is just too much diversity 

Recording: (3759/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3760/ 10721) 
yeah i would i would say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english or math or you know i can not believe what i am saying this history but  i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it 

Recording: (3761/ 10721) 
well let i make an analogy with your women who is more important who is saying that not being uh not being a priest is not important being your individual we are all called to be important a police it is just a uh an occupation a oh that society out there he the the president of the united states is named better off than you are you should not be 

Recording: (3762/ 10721) 
yeah or yeah you know it is a tough one you know you got kids that are doing softball soccer you know all these events and you know like on thursdays when the a daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually drives from work to the softball and after that she home by nine so she is like i can see it you fall into this drive through window business you know not but luckily you know i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can 

Recording: (3763/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (3764/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3765/ 10721) 
i like some of the stuff that is coming out now i like oldies and the seventies and the sixties and uh i guess what is hard for me to listen to is i guess i do not know it used to be wn ti where they part of the reason was i they just played the same songs over and over again yeah 

Recording: (3766/ 10721) 
you know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just want to start off at something easy and um they only take national merit scholarships and they are 

Recording: (3767/ 10721) 
you might think i am an idiot you know i mean you next person walking the door might be real good 

Recording: (3768/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3769/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3770/ 10721)

Recording: (3774/ 10721) 
ten years no question about it that is it you are in jail for ten years eighteen years old if you have got anything on ten years that is it you know and you look at some of these other people like sports people and 

Recording: (3775/ 10721) 
the dumb ass here  i say i bet you do not even know how it is spelled sears cloud or 

Recording: (3776/ 10721) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication but if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or buy a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (3777/ 10721) 
a little sister all of those now you say teach that well my god did not they know that when they first came into this classroom no not today not today i i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i am not being arbitr uh students in high school today probably have not had their mother or their father truly hold them and hug them rather than just saying 

Recording: (3778/ 10721) 
 obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is i have been around for a long time 

Recording: (3779/ 10721) 
that is good to be there 

Recording: (3780/ 10721)

Recording: (3785/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to hear to find that that columbus is in so out of shape um but i am in the uh well you know and the circles that i move in uh everybody is first middle aged and they all quit smoking and they are all all of a sudden trying to beat off the reper and um uh so uh you know i mean i mean well and of course they were always hippies and eight sprows and a twigs and leaves anyway you know

Recording: (3795/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (3796/ 10721) 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he just he is a good role model 

Recording: (3797/ 10721) 
um they try to limit the the 

Recording: (3798/ 10721)

but i mean like if test scores are identical and have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (3829/ 10721) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is a pretty decent person i mean i do not think that there is anything violent or there is anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focus is on the ones that are out of control and makes a big deal of those ones that are are out of control and i think that is sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local

yeah 

Recording: (3836/ 10721) 
right and and you are not as close to your family and the traditions and the and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up and worked and moving that i do not think kids have the center based of the family that they used to have and i do not know the the culture is just so fast paced but i do not think people are maybe it is not honesty maybe it is just they do not have as much time to get attached and 

Recording: (3837/ 10721)

Recording: (3853/ 10721) 
i mean obviously if someone is like thirty and a gay i do not see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 

Recording: (3854/ 10721) 
well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes uh you know a lot of the you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and uh you know maybe pull these kids uh into more of a group setting or something and give them more um you know counseling uh professional you know counseling 

Recording: (3855/ 10721) 
and they had they you know they went through their own training and everything and we did not you know face with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one walking or march or summer of it as far as pratternising you were not allowed to

yeah uh i i think that he is he is right to my generation what more uh oh i do not do not want to say spiritual but more morally uh well directed and 

Recording: (3900/ 10721) 
uh that is not true i mean uh some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes um 

Recording: (3901/ 10721) 
i just have not enjoyed it right yeah before that i was fine if i still if i i made a mistake by playing for that one job i just wanted to get something different because i did not want to go back where i was i would have been better off back where i was i would have been better at the job for one thing and i knew knew kind of insanity i would be dealing with there 

Recording: (3902/ 10721) 
i mean i could practically graduate already i have all the credits but then you have those required classes that you have to take 

Recording: (3903/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3904/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3905/ 10721) 
and that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i have been cross trained or however you want to say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raises and i have seen me get two percent raises when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (3906/ 10721) 
they are but it seems like they are going out yeah instead of having we do not do things in hotels and things because they have inhouse 

Recording: (3907/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3908/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3909/ 10721) 
that is awesome there is there is lots of stuff to do down there if you like outdoors  i bet 

Recording: (3910/ 10721) 
because apparently the apparently the get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in front of their face and they would be like 

Recording: (3911/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3912/ 10721) 
even they do not get faxed right a lot of the time uh 

Recording: (3913/ 10721) 
 like like what is the other if you had time and money and you would you would be able to you know do the do the terrorist things 

Recording: (3914/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3915/ 10721) 
so he gives them a drug called well buton which is a you know like an enid press that type thing that they said works for um the d h d but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study 

Recording: (3916/ 10721) 
uh without going into too much detail um one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church out here and learned a lot and and really stumble across a lot of interesting doctor and and physiological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he does not and and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heritage and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours 

Recording: (3917/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (3918/ 10721) 
uh hide in your face when you and i i mean what you can 

Recording: (3919/ 10721) 
me i do not want to go to jail and get arrested because i feel i will do my people any service by being in jail 

Recording: (3920/ 10721) 
just i think it is uh to to affect the the um beliefs that we are trying to carry and and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i am not saying that it is terrible but if they have like a nose ring and all this stuff then it somebody might not believe that they have anything incredible to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more or 

Recording: (3921/ 10721) 
no but oh she is really plain smart i mean 

Recording: (3922/ 10721) 
yeah and 

Recording: (3923/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah she went to school here till uh ninety one actually uh so she was let us see about the fourth grade great 

Recording: (3924/ 10721) 
huh  

Recording: (3925/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3926/ 10721) 
but it made a lot of people more rare 

Recording: (3927/ 10721) 
i do not i think that what they were protesting was that they were being involved in it was not that part of their protest 

Recording: (3928/ 10721) 
oh yeah they are getting better though they really are they are much better now than they were twenty years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so features are having to learn to for example 

Recording: (3929/ 10721) 
to teacher umhum he works at a high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders  no i dont think that at all i would be deceiving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about them i am just like oh my gosh i can not believe all of the 

Recording: (3930/ 10721) 
do you know what i mean 

Recording: (3931/ 10721) 
yeah one of my uh friends cousins went to that maternity um i do not remember what the cause was of his death um but i mean like i said i mean it definitely is a dangerous drug to be using and i mean not to say that they should legalize it or anything i mean obviously that is pretty extreme to do but like you said i mean it is something more where people should know the risks of it and know what goes into it 

Recording: (3932/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3933/ 10721) 
i mean 

Recording: (3934/ 10721) 
i think he is 

Recording: (3935/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3936/ 10721) 
you ask is it okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there and the i think uh that are left there for for breakfast and maybe at lunch and uh she she will walk out there i do not know say well grand paul how come you did you they are not done and then she turns right and walks away a and that is right uhhuh and and she made a 

Recording: (3937/ 10721) 
and i know that in my case i will use a personal case i will use frank my older son uh well the ones i am speaking of the one the boys are going on seventeen the one little girl just turn to eleven and the other one turn eight well they go over to the one grandparents house and she has a habit of paying them for little jobs that her own house so i think only when they come to my house 

Recording: (3938/ 10721) 
and that is the way i put it it is kind of new agey and i do not like new agey stuff but you know it is uh the best example is a mazda from the when you flip on a light the malls will go right to it a child like that a young man like that is very impressionable very young still and uh these bad will be flocked right now 

Recording: (3939/ 10721) 
we are getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it is still got way too much cow town personality 

Recording: (3940/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (3941/ 10721) 
because i have seen a lot of bad parents i have seen a lot of bad people you know what i mean i have seen people you know you always hear about drugs and all that i have seen people sitting there drinking 

Recording: (3942/ 10721) 
um it i mean it was a pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there 

Recording: (3943/ 10721) 
yeah i was in the sales department through telephone marketing there was actual sales that i was doing i was there for fifteen years 

Recording: (3944/ 10721) 
but the professors seem more center centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you know you can not diminished all your bottom line for you know making your workers feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (3945/ 10721) 
it is where byo and fromatics was about a year or two ago 

Recording: (3946/ 10721) 
trying to get that job  

Recording: (3947/ 10721) 
shun and yeah uhhuh um um we do not have enough sex problems sure we could do the  

Recording: (3948/ 10721) 
you you why be doing eight children now 

Recording: (3949/ 10721) 
and the long line carriers they do not even know how to bill us 

Recording: (3950/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3951/ 10721) 
whatever you want sure 

Recording: (3952/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3953/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3954/ 10721) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i know it is like i mean it is the same proportion i mean there are more old people there but it just seems more apparent just because of how but you can like go out all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (3955/ 10721) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choice um you and your husband is like what do you think you should teach maybe not sex specifically but just like general rules for good living if your church is saying one thing but realistically you think maybe something a little bit different but when you how do you think this is all that conflict um 

Recording: (3956/ 10721) 
um i do not really know i would say i mean it is definitely what is nature and definitely something has to be done to them 

Recording: (3957/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3958/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (3959/ 10721)

Recording: (3968/ 10721) 
better sign long as 

Recording: (3969/ 10721) 
yeah but yeah i think the mother has more of a instinct for that but as far as the studies go where the people roll over in their babies i do not see how you could roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were 

Recording: (3970/ 10721) 
in what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you know so

well is there any kind of you know training i mean are they doing like the whole job training after the two years or during the two years 

Recording: (3974/ 10721) 
and the hospital has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients um the state of ohio is i think the only state that has a given um practicners prescriptions authority where we can write our own prescriptions so we can see patients do the physicals we can suggest medications i guess per se but then the physician has to come in and come from our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions 

Recording: (3975/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3976/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3977/ 10721)

well they pretty much put by the test scores they do not sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we are and they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting another student what the student still needs for the complete and that grade and once they figure that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder 

Recording: (3998/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3999/ 10721)

you know the options are your bed down i had to take my down because i broke my ankle fall quarter 

Recording: (4006/ 10721) 
no because they are gonna learn that on their own um i i personally think that is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homosexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and blah blah blah because but i have also known people that word that way and now are homosexual and are much happier and they realized that it was just a choice they 

Recording: (4007/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4008/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4009/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4010/ 10721) 
yeah i can not  

Recording: (4011/ 10721) 
well i what what what neighborhood do you live in because i you know i see asians and indians and all come everywhere but boy they do not live on my street 

Recording: (4012/ 10721) 
yeah i think so um met quite a few people from cleveland and then my roommate from north canton 

Recording: (4013/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4014/ 10721) 
 i have to think of some words there but you know it is since everybody is just making it into a big deal that maybe it will be yeah 

Recording: (4015/ 10721) 
uh my stepmother is 

Recording: (4016/ 10721) 
they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not of working age they get like an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think uh fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they are provided they are the top of the list for a council house so they get they are on there was actually a long document around before i left um you know of this girl who is constantly fighting with her parents 

Recording: (4017/ 10721) 
go but they are always stopping something and they do not seem to move forward very well 

Recording: (4018/ 10721) 
that will be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (4019/ 10721) 
you know they want to be judges like everybody else but i you know i think um they have so many different ideas and not that even one of them is right but still um i i think there is always gonna barrier their they are just kids are just not all kids are gonna get along you know i mean 

Recording: (4020/ 10721) 
 um and it is really it is like uh it is just different than i thought so if i come i have been a place like i should not stay and just be miserable about it 

Recording: (4021/ 10721) 
and so it it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that willing to say i just can not make this he let he let my daughter who is thirteen he left left her and the movies one night they went to the movies they was no um the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not going to start until nine thirty which means this kid is twelve years old so that would have been a eleven three twelve you know athletics he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although just tom boy who is just amazing but anyhow he 

Recording: (4022/ 10721) 
my god 

Recording: (4023/ 10721) 
and i think that unfortunately you spend a lot of your time trying to get out of out of personal issues that you have gotten yourself into and you can not really focus on anything that is that is positive that you want to do for for their country and i think i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was president you know i thought i would want to be president but you know you would have three or four things that you would think were very you would you would hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that you feel like they would actually be able to accomplish some things and you have really worked to get some 

Recording: (4024/ 10721) 
i i do not know i do not remember 

Recording: (4025/ 10721) 
i was about to see now on the record off the 

Recording: (4026/ 10721) 
um it is considered urban but because it is north of akron we play like a lot of like the inner city like in akron schools but in my opinion yeah suburbia like but we have the we have the big city problems like there is a lot of drugs and i think that is just because the building is old so no one really takes pride in it and then it two thousand people 

Recording: (4027/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (4028/ 10721) 
it is uh 

Recording: (4029/ 10721) 
yeah it is usually like about a third or something um i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus it is just basically getting out of the house yeah well 

Recording: (4030/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (4031/ 10721) 
uhhuh an all white jury 

Recording: (4032/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (4033/ 10721) 
i picked eighty pounds a pop one time growing along the railroad tracks and brought it back to columbus eighty pounds 

Recording: (4034/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4035/ 10721) 
uh which which the the as far as the the 

Recording: (4036/ 10721) 
it seems like it just about everywhere on that street is uh one way or another criminal 

Recording: (4037/ 10721) 
it is it is  uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh they are they are they are or some fun things like that yeah uh sidney opera house i have a picture that in my head with the big shelves the big uh 

Recording: (4038/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4039/ 10721) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (4040/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4041/ 10721) 
um yeah umhum yeah 

Recording: (4042/ 10721) 
yeah the same thing you were talking about and we are only the third people to live in it and so it needed everything you know and it had gold car now gold back but in those days everything was like gold and you know and green it was horrible and uh it was great fun we had we had a lot of fun we we took the back porch and made a part of the kitching and had another back porch put on the changed the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put it in ground pool and so i always joked because what 

Recording: (4043/ 10721) 
interactive they are 

Recording: (4044/ 10721) 
little upropped for me and he says well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you could die it will just have to wait him and i just you know i am just not ready for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is going really wild i mean i just i and i know we just finished our little math classes last night and there was some they are huge i mean these girls can not even get off the floor and i just feel really bad for them so for me it is it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems 

Recording: (4045/ 10721) 
um they did briefly like cover things like that with like religion and health classes things like that 

Recording: (4046/ 10721) 
and i had a few serious relationships but i just i never felt they were the right ones 

Recording: (4047/ 10721) 
yeah my uh my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control uh the whole family hundreds hunters and things like that and my fatherinlaw was a hunter but he was not opposed to gun control either uh as long as he could hunt 

Recording: (4048/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4049/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4050/ 10721) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like um my knees they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her husband was on problems and my knees is at eight well she was in fifth grade and there is elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursed and smoking cigarettes and everything and i just i am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (4051/ 10721) 
yeah blue that that is right frank sinatra is the one who is saying no i will do it i did it my way and that is really i think the biggest problem in the world today i want to do it my way and you can not oh you have got to cooperate with the other person 

Recording: (4052/ 10721) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is because that is what happens to a lot of them you know they they come out of school all i dealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management you there is you want the tax break you want the thing you know what i mean and then they like i have an uncle he is a vice president of wall street from maryland she said you know he he got out of school is very idealistic but now he 

Recording: (4053/ 10721) 
 went okay when they um when that song came out you would probably hear it at least twelve times a day on some of those radio stations and it got so i just uh not stand this i can not stand this 

Recording: (4054/ 10721) 
really and people use do people use them 

Recording: (4055/ 10721) 
umhum and then they end up okay anyway  that is good  

Recording: (4056/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (4057/ 10721) 
not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have gotten older too i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important anymore 

Recording: (4058/ 10721) 
which i had a conversation with her about and said you know you did not cause anything you know i mean your mother calls at all and if anything you were the price part of the whole merit so that is well you got to look yourself when you would see that reflecting in the mirror and remember that you know 

Recording: (4059/ 10721) 
the front door and it was only he and i in the office you know and every once in a while his wife would be in there and i just i lost it i was i i was mad but i did not want him to think that i was afraid i wanted to be him to be afraid of me so i just i stopped back to my desk and i said oh great i said not only are you a pain to work without to be afraid of you and then i think i did scare him because he started you know he backed off a lot and just his personality and his his and then that that was a 

Recording: (4060/ 10721) 
the nose for green trees 

Recording: (4061/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so it is kind of like the small town thing which there has goods in that is what i do not know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with that still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple of years ago and a lot of participation in that and so 

Recording: (4062/ 10721) 
what 

Recording: (4063/ 10721) 
while saying well platoon everything and sinuses dumb and stuff as as far as bringing it together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (4064/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4065/ 10721) 
where the where they were going and and uh he worked in a trailer uh out in the yards you know 

Recording: (4066/ 10721) 
we well sort of and kind of yes we i mean we dated in high school but he ended up going to problem with somebody else and we i mean we we went to we went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom and his mom are camp fire leaders together in the whole bit and now we did not really date in um college kind of really did not get together at all freshman year he did go to school here and then um as i said i spent for ohio state and then i went into akla david is in a supporting 

Recording: (4067/ 10721) 
yeah yeah well it is um and you know he and it was very you know it was very slow and and cute if you character and sand it and we much different now 

Recording: (4068/ 10721) 
i do not know if that would be really a problem though i mean i do not know if that would honestly happen 

Recording: (4069/ 10721) 
yeah yeah so that is pretty much what she likes to do 

Recording: (4070/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4071/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4072/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4073/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4074/ 10721) 
yeah they could be yeah 

Recording: (4075/ 10721) 
and that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more with people every day of our life that is where we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people well just like if you are um uh a parent getting giving allowance you do not give them the your kids uh money to do chores they normally expect them to do but you get them something in addition to develop more responsibility well we do not talk about responsibility i i i dare you say where in the heck they say publicly 

Recording: (4076/ 10721) 
you can not see it in a 

Recording: (4077/ 10721) 
because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more or socialist than they are capitalist and they are easier to deal with than they are more reasonable people in my opinion much more reasonable but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and and all i am the minority in my family  believe 

Recording: (4078/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4079/ 10721) 
of the times and memories and stuff 

Recording: (4080/ 10721) 
no because some kids still stop at my house 

Recording: (4081/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4082/ 10721) 
of consequence uh and uh uh a penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply okay jane eyre and janey you should not do that 

Recording: (4083/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4084/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4085/ 10721) 
to florida and i was just in there for a little while and 

Recording: (4086/ 10721) 
not if he would been as open about it as as he was here uh you know clinton did that also and and thought he would be able to um they strenuous the uh the the military and fan out with his first action as president that there there is a strong backlash against that at least nationwide and and and in the military but i thought it was the right stance um 

Recording: (4087/ 10721) 
get back to god get back to believing in god and the values that the family should have i do not know how is that connected well god did not teach you to go out and shoot your neighbor and he did not go out and tell you to steal from him and he did not tell you to uh ignore him the rest of your life he did not tell you that they are down there bleeding into there uh walking turn the other i mean he taught you to help and be loving toward each other and and it is liking a lot of people today as i said it that is that old me me me 

Recording: (4088/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4089/ 10721) 
to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their or values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (4090/ 10721) 
uh i have always had an interest in german history and also in eastern european history and i mean it seemed to be a natural way that i to tie those two together for a thesis 

Recording: (4091/ 10721) 
um yes and no i mean as far as the experience goes i mean i do not live on campus so i do not get the entire college experience you know the whole dorms and events going place on campus it is more things about picking shoes that i wanted do on campus i come down for um so i can not really say it is anything too drastic i mean obviously it is kind of weird when people asking what you are doing you 

Recording: (4092/ 10721) 
huhuh 

Recording: (4093/ 10721) 
it is a good time i mean what are they got to do i mean he is been through enough how all all his personal life just can not be much worse i would not think uh and he does he does back down i think too much um yeah 

Recording: (4094/ 10721) 
all creation into religion all of what spiritual is into one word religion you you can not um but when you say it is a of spiritual nature that is you know that is still even the door wide open that it is that is broad it is bigger than you are may uh but that uh that whole the whole thing is um you know the people who had a specific instructions on how to do things and i am not saying they were perfect either 

Recording: (4095/ 10721) 
i thought i would expect that from dogs i mean yeah a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff and probably they like 

Recording: (4096/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4097/ 10721) 
and disney and disney is pretty strong i mean you know you think of disney and you think of kids but you still a lot of the stuff they put out it is pretty hard course for five year old or something you know a lot of the dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it is it is a violent nature so but you got to if you balance it i think you will be all right oh yeah absolutely yeah it is tough sometimes  

Recording: (4098/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4099/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4100/ 10721) 
it is for the entire state and so this is just the columbus there is columbus to you know dayton i do not know any others 

Recording: (4101/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4102/ 10721) 
when you can see for somebody else is firm or somebody else is whatever uh because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child here that needs help and here is again you are reaching out to your friends your neighbor you are not just forgetting about any of what the welfare is somebody take care of them and let them go down the drain and i think that that that is what adoption is and and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is left and when you are trying and willing to have well some people are probably 

Recording: (4103/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (4104/ 10721) 
yeah my mom did not like that she said when they go to school you are going to have they are going to have different last names than you i am like so what  i do not care 

Recording: (4105/ 10721) 
but he he he is 

Recording: (4106/ 10721) 
is the only time for money yes 

Recording: (4107/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4108/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4109/ 10721) 
the country you know but i do not think i would go think you know i just do not feel the need to go on a rampant or anything 

Recording: (4110/ 10721) 
and i have a wife been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven both of them one is in second grade and the other one is still in day care at ohio state university 

Recording: (4111/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4112/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (4113/ 10721) 
he can eat fresh water 

Recording: (4114/ 10721) 
yeah there there were troubled kids in the past who had no backgrounds in it 

Recording: (4115/ 10721) 
it is that is weird  

Recording: (4116/ 10721) 
but when he first started out i liked him he had on sensible things simon and all those what we are talking about now i think sometimes but he and where to keep up with uh uh i can not remember all the names of their shows that i do not watch but i am doing oh uproar is one of them and all those are the people that is just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done and all that malar okay and i think he decided he had to do something on his program or for him to keep his ratings up so you know i i see that is what you mean by getting into what this person does over here and that is another 

Recording: (4117/ 10721) 
because they are they are they are saying you are still a kid but yet 

Recording: (4118/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4119/ 10721) 
it has a lot to do with the fact that the that they the church 

Recording: (4120/ 10721) 
and she ran a fork lift into one pole  in front of him and then her nose and chipped her shoes  just is a dangerous woman   and um so uh she gets a lot of tickets sometimes when she is not getting hurt yeah when she is not running into pool so um and you know we will use them because they do not they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home we 

Recording: (4121/ 10721) 
tied up to a fence that you know i think they deserve to die because the prisons and the overcrowling that is a whole another subject you know that it is just amazing to me that so many people are in there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (4122/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4123/ 10721) 
but she is doing fine uh she was dating somebody i do not know whether they really got married or not you know because i do not really have that much communication with her with some guy younger than her and i talked to him he seemed like pretty decent guy yeah 

Recording: (4124/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (4125/ 10721) 
the factory there is uh not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of of of um industry in the man isville area but there is a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed it is been it is been there for a while yeah we have got the man isville state reformatory where shoshank redemption was where shoshank redemption was recorded yeah yeah 

Recording: (4126/ 10721) 
yeah right right and the amount of money that is spent is just i i can just can not imagine you know millions and millions have been spent already hundreds of millions it is just starting 

Recording: (4127/ 10721) 
she is got like a third grade education she is like a kid herself

it is great  because he is have a used kid on my back  oh yeah that is what everyone has you think  

Recording: (4130/ 10721) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh as one of the guys tried to help me several is and i am afraid of that too so because right there in that pit there that is god now if you remember that there is nothing in here that can and hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much where and there although 

Recording: (4131/ 10721) 
well now my youngest son married a catholic girl who is from a large catholic family and there kids were going to a catholic school 

Recording: (4132/ 10721)

Recording: (4153/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4154/ 10721) 
i think more what they need to do is districts or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are overing shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look at other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like 

Recording: (4155/ 10721)

Recording: (4176/ 10721) 
well uh a long time ago uh when they had signed a decoration and everything they said you know build a fence around your place and and take care of your own you know and i think basically that is the way the philosophy should be i think there is times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman uh 

Recording: (4177/ 10721) 
thing or i i i or how really want to say it i really think that that is most of it and i do not know how people i got a letter the other day and i can not remember from the name of the personality that was doing it be sending out these things about how you can sign up to taking them right in and say do not have these kind of tv programs on anywhere where they use a preventity where they use the drinking where they use the dope and uh were the use of all kennedy and i understand this thing about him being

Recording: (4185/ 10721) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (4186/ 10721) 
something that truly hurt injured uh now today however uh i suspect my mom could easily be could have been charged with abuse child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that uh green sweat it was always a green switch because uh there is the old ones they would break you do not want to break brick  

Recording: (4187/ 10721) 
or does this say this you know this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal until about out their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay 

Recording: (4188/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4189/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4190/ 10721)

yeah so it it she is funny because she is gained twenty six pounds and it she does not look pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today 

Recording: (4192/ 10721) 
well i know people that sleep outside and uh but not all of them are veterans and everything but they they are again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh staying in an open shoulder or going away or something like that 

Recording: (4193/ 10721) 
yeah we could actually we use the grandby library they have a really good library there and a large selection of videos and they have story time things where they read to the kids and get them interested in books and you know different type of things where you can win things for reading amount of books 

Recording: (4194/ 10721) 
i hear in new york city where it is a lot more populated it is uh getting real bad of course you probably know about that 

Recording: (4195/ 10721) 
just do not talk when other people are talking just general things that i think you should take for granted 

Recording: (4196/ 10721) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (4197/ 10721) 
yeah we have kind of broken our fat thank goodness the counter stuff 

Recording: (4198/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (4199/ 10721) 
i learned about the sweats there is some people that uh taking pictures of sweat lodges which you are not supposed to do well they show step by step how to build one and and tell you what some kind of wood to build it out of and ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood um there is a way to do it and there is a way a way to do it uh it has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that um because the people this land were given specific 

Recording: (4200/ 10721) 
um i met her in high school she is still in high school and i am in college so 

Recording: (4201/ 10721) 
knew the first days in here he knew everything that i was going to teach this grading period well that kind of flew up a red fly to me and can can you give him other assignments oh no he is got say whatever else is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the the parents advisory committee at the time so i had easy access to the principal he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library the librarian worked with him oneonone teaching database and spreadsheet uh applications to him but 

Recording: (4202/ 10721) 
definitely 

Recording: (4203/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (4204/ 10721) 
you know what kind of an answer is that even if your answer is i do not know why you can not do it it just makes me uncomfortable you know that is a lot more fair than because i am the boss or something like that and i think if you raise back to your kids and and just kind of thought about her as what um you know kind of try to be i do not know that is the way that is the way my family is always been and the guy seems to work really well for us 

Recording: (4205/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (4206/ 10721) 
yeah it it is i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is yeah um let us see what it was my dicot or carter is a lot more difficult that is somebody else do it for me 

Recording: (4207/ 10721) 
no no not at all it is not much in 

Recording: (4208/ 10721) 
and none of the animals they profile were pets i mean a thirty six foot long python what the hell is a person doing with that is a pet and they should not be allowed to and then people treated a buffalo like they could stand next to it and take a family picture 

Recording: (4209/ 10721) 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4210/ 10721) 
so that is mainly probably more for fishing 

Recording: (4211/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4212/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4213/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4214/ 10721) 
but if you love if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also and in other words you are not laying the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not going to let get away with it no i am sorry have my child committed something that this other one i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i tried to teach you different i do not know where you went wrong i do not want to do it wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty um 

Recording: (4215/ 10721) 
they find out an way to get to um an um idea of the guy where we came in on his little brother and he was letting the bullets in the gun and he had them totally separate like that and kids kids know and they are curious um i do not know i mean i am not for guns because i i basically the guns do not scare me the people that scare me so uh no unless they have them in a safe or something and 

Recording: (4216/ 10721) 
you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4217/ 10721) 
that is when you take him to grand mall yeah that is what we do and he is got together great criminal night that can we live with my mom and dad so he gets to see my sight all the time but he does not get to see them as much so it is like when that night comes on go go to grandma  or like we take to him to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets uh those free 

Recording: (4218/ 10721) 
oh i know they do not care they got money people got down 

Recording: (4219/ 10721) 
the birth control issue became so personal and uh it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with uh what i thought was uh clear conscience in what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (4220/ 10721) 
i guess almost that over there i wish they would celebrate every holiday so then they are exposed to all of it instead of none of it 

Recording: (4221/ 10721) 
california high schools but even there you know there was you know a a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on it is definitely not i have been going on and that was only on a very small group there were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students stuff this happened out so 

Recording: (4222/ 10721) 
they are growing up we push all this in the you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and and what we are allowed to to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people 

Recording: (4223/ 10721) 
but um 

Recording: (4224/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (4225/ 10721) 
i think there is been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think it even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking them away from the other the the cousins i mean they the cousins have been stressing all along i mean he needs a family he needs a family well there is a much closer family than your father and it is it is a love this country and stuff well and accept the laws and follow them whether you agree with them or not uh i i 

Recording: (4226/ 10721) 
so he will not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4227/ 10721) 
that is probably what i will do ignore to until like august or july and then start paying attention 

Recording: (4228/ 10721) 
they asked me that i asked my manager the other day she told me i am supposed to do this certain thing and i asked her i said well they told me i was not supposed to 

Recording: (4229/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4230/ 10721) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (4231/ 10721) 
i lived i went actually went there for interior design i lived right off the street 

Recording: (4232/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4233/ 10721) 
it is very hard i mean i missed a lot of school i mean most people would think that i have a lot of help but i really do not i mean i live with my parents and thing and i mean they have jobs too it is not like 

Recording: (4234/ 10721) 
although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people praying and they are prayed with their heart and i tell you because of and how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart on a bunch of real fancy words and and a real comfortable setting you know that that he 

Recording: (4235/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4236/ 10721) 
um i have not personally researched it but i have seen uh i would personally research it if i was president um documentaries and what not and things on twenty twenty which i do not wholeheartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes in your out has really seemed to work in california because 

Recording: (4237/ 10721) 
yeah stuff is in front of my house 

Recording: (4238/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (4239/ 10721) 
things you know collecting but it is hard with my sister is cats because she has a little girl and no she does not go home back every day you know but um 

Recording: (4240/ 10721) 
they really have no selfworth because you know uh i know a long time ago i we went to a uh uh it was that was like a a seminar for the ivy league which i looked at the tuition and went uh you know there was no way but and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man that there was like four or five men talking and women talking whatever and uh they said you know if your if your child makes three days and uh applies at our school we do not want 

Recording: (4241/ 10721) 
so i am just working over here on the the uh stadium 

Recording: (4242/ 10721) 
and there is like nothing in it and uh you know it is like go down the list that is what i do he just thinks i automatically know him a mind reader  that is what it is  

Recording: (4243/ 10721) 
i hope so yeah  

Recording: (4244/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4245/ 10721) 
well i think uh in my opinion i think mainly the uh is the absence of uh basically parenting you know uh uh my mom was there uh she was a housewife you know and uh so she was she went to work after i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother and all my brothers and sisters are graduated you know so 

Recording: (4246/ 10721) 
i do not think that changed my mind about anything i mean i do not approve of his immoral behavior but it does not the way he runs the country 

Recording: (4247/ 10721) 
i think it better grades last nine weeks did not i well it is not amazing you were taking your bills in some connection here  so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let us just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we will write them down and say oh well last night she did that without any problem at all this night we except you have not been able to focus on that maybe this does help you some maybe you just you know not giving it credit 

Recording: (4248/ 10721) 
yeah i mean like it just it provides an a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 

Recording: (4249/ 10721) 
the snuffer and all that 

Recording: (4250/ 10721) 
you know we we really do not know much about his life away you know away from home 

Recording: (4251/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (4252/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4253/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4254/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4255/ 10721) 
well not really they have a lot of um religious beliefs in their own that they have had held onto because um they just have had nothing 

Recording: (4256/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4257/ 10721) 
it is all right 

Recording: (4258/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4259/ 10721) 
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (4260/ 10721) 
i have become visually decentized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather gruesome events in history three that still are very i still find disturbing um ah uh also hang out and little 

Recording: (4261/ 10721) 
i think that is that would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4262/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4263/ 10721) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (4264/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4265/ 10721) 
it could cause any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (4266/ 10721) 
an uh oh do they 

Recording: (4267/ 10721) 
and finally i do not know whether there are we had a paper called bobber is station plain i do not know whether he is or who but anyway they finally figured that he was in a a a tunnel for the rail road 

Recording: (4268/ 10721) 
yeah the only thing i am going to do is maybe two weeks before i might get a hundred dollars from the bank machine and uh i have three cars so i probably have one of them full of gas and other than that it is like you know to me if you are a bank won and i am honeyton and january the second people have all kinds problem you and i are going to be the laughing stock of the corporate america and you really think you and i want to do that so to me nobody is going to have a problem because yours they are gonna go 

Recording: (4269/ 10721) 
professors and everything but i think you know they get a lot of these kids and they do not care about school but they will they leave early because they know they can do it 

Recording: (4270/ 10721) 
and uh you know it is oh you got our we are open to that you know 

Recording: (4271/ 10721) 
well it is like that i 

Recording: (4272/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4273/ 10721) 
you know it was in the butt do not get me wrong he told me he was going to have me uh locked up for child abuse so i do it last in the car and took them downtown and took them inside and told him to tell them people because they are going to lock him up 

Recording: (4274/ 10721) 
you know but you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is twenty two i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to look for a pervert you need to look for and you need to check out and you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work study job  you know 

Recording: (4275/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (4276/ 10721) 
uh poor people can not do that um so after all of a sudden on with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that uh you know and the attorney and the firm got a third plus you had to pay off as expenses so really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars which if used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person uh but a very stupid person 

Recording: (4277/ 10721) 
twenty one million dollar check to hit the the door step you know 

Recording: (4278/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (4279/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4280/ 10721) 
you do not tell me what to do i said well okay you wanna call me back well who will like it or something like that i think she called me in to call me back a couple three hours later and i was pissed so i talked to her you know little charley is things i will pay you back you know 

Recording: (4281/ 10721) 
that is like twenty five or thirty an hour 

Recording: (4282/ 10721) 
one well that is good that is exciting  

Recording: (4283/ 10721) 
and there is all kinds of things going on i mean you if you had the money you could do something every night  it is 

Recording: (4284/ 10721) 
than than they were raised and they are but i told her i you know there is i will never be married if my man is going to be cheap enough me i will not marry them 

Recording: (4285/ 10721) 
i know well you get you get to take advantage of it for layoffs and stuff 

Recording: (4286/ 10721) 
 what would they have to gain  um 

Recording: (4287/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4288/ 10721) 
place for computers at my plants at the corner and then have my little paper sack 

Recording: (4289/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4290/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4291/ 10721) 
yeah or a conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my here is my dog my labrador uh yeah and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting and uh they were objective you know and and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pressing on the carpet and making messes and doing things up and 

Recording: (4292/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4293/ 10721) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the side and then you got all these people you know i have been in the fights in my neighborhood and well in my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out outlandish behavior i mean i caught i actually wrote up on uh a couple people 

Recording: (4294/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4295/ 10721) 
yeah she still has the family 

Recording: (4296/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4297/ 10721) 
well i guess the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun and ways around the school you know that is the big thing now but just that you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support grow through the uh if they do have uh they have to wait until something is pretty pretty regious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (4298/ 10721) 
all all focus changes it really does 

Recording: (4299/ 10721) 
well i think all through growing up there is always been you know different kind of kids 

Recording: (4300/ 10721) 
uh yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and i just like ended up with wrong because i would have like failed everything anyway so it um and i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like no i no me and her and my other friend live in don may and her 

Recording: (4301/ 10721) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of you know america just being like the country of access like access positions access food access way to access money you know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back and you know this i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of manland europe and 

Recording: (4302/ 10721)

Recording: (4303/ 10721) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have uh a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spend the second half of the day just hanging out so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know

Recording: (4309/ 10721) 
well when i was a senior in high school i wished my parents would have pushed me to do something practical but i am glad they did not because it gave me a chance to make my own decision

Recording: (4314/ 10721)

Recording: (4315/ 10721) 
was not worth hearing about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (4316/ 10721) 
um i mean they did not really do anything too extensive on it they basically as far as religion classes go they basically told what the catholic church believed about it and how they called about it but i mean they did not really condam or support it or anything like that i mean they they basically did realize that it is more up to the person i mean 

Recording: (4317/ 10721) 
oh okay okay uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh does charity work

Recording: (4345/ 10721) 
nowadays it is easy just to get a kid of beeper 

Recording: (4346/ 10721) 
i think the main problem with this year was the coaching it is good that they got rid of two coaches but his attitude i just do not think the kids think of him as a role model and i think a coach has to be a oh myrtle i used to work at the high end on capitol square 

Recording: (4347/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4348/ 10721) 
it is i mean 

Recording: (4349/ 10721) 
conferencing even though they got straight a is i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like saying i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand a is i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is to see then that is what it will be but i said if your best is in a way to get into you got me to talk to so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a is and when they take the 

Recording: (4350/ 10721) 
um

Recording: (4353/ 10721) 
everybody is coastal but uh 

Recording: (4354/ 10721) 
as uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or neither does say no to something  she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with but and the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were 

Recording: (4355/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4356/ 10721) 
and getting back to the profanity and stuff that was another one was in the paper some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something almost their little kids maybe six or seven rate walked in there and said what the age you know for a letter word is this four and the father is time and it looks good and after the kids walked out i says to her well where in the age do that child learn to talk like that so she gave himself away right away so she think it is the one it is the ones that are teaching the kids and it is it is all 

Recording: (4357/ 10721) 
yeah i can not you can what is europe in your miss spain oh okay see that will be it you can plan that as a second honey move  so your wife would object sure honey i can i can do it  i can fit it in  they had three

Recording: (4361/ 10721) 
you know for me getting out of bed is is a victory you know for the longest time i was so depressed you know but the the animals you know yeah using the animals uh uh for therapy animal therapy um i mean dogs in regular cats um but you know there is uh there is some animals that are not to be pets you know um they are 

Recording: (4362/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4363/ 10721) 
 honestly i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (4364/ 10721) 
and all through style and she still tested him with the other kids just making sure she had not missed any he had not missed anything and she he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this and uh it was he loved it and that is what he needed but when we got to high school and we would talk to teachers about this and no they could not do that that was very frustrated it was strange 

Recording: (4365/ 10721) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (4366/ 10721) 
i do have some relatives that are um step my stepmom is relatives that are there they are actually members of the mormon church 

Recording: (4367/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4368/ 10721) 
well and they had to cover their i know all of that but i do not think that is really been 

Recording: (4369/ 10721) 
he is really just yeah he does not think through the implications of things real well is personal life 

Recording: (4370/ 10721) 
uh well working on a it is a project that has been ongoing for about a year and i have voluntarily given up a lot of things i like to do and i am looking forward to catching up music uh painting uh that sort of thing 

Recording: (4371/ 10721) 
stomink them  

Recording: (4372/ 10721) 
it just like it is it is just amazing to me to be that pregnant and not be able to even hardly look like it 

Recording: (4373/ 10721) 
less in america than there 

Recording: (4374/ 10721) 
they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you are talking about uh uh uh greater uh greater intercommunication i would like to go back one step well we are talking about when i made mention the three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we are nearing zero in terms of global 

Recording: (4375/ 10721) 
those are the good days that is a good day that is when you used to own them too you could trade them that that is when we lost our rights  there is some things that are traditional that are capitality and some are low key low case tee and your talk about lot of case to i am talking about capital to 

Recording: (4376/ 10721) 
i am 

Recording: (4377/ 10721) 
uh it is quite possible but we picked the day care that i thought was closest to well the one that was open that had the closest values that we had um um i personally would like a church based program but there are not any well there were not any open when we were looking for one um we did have the option enough going here to ohio to their day care and it has a wonderful reputation and everybody that i have talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program 

Recording: (4378/ 10721) 
half tank gas 

Recording: (4379/ 10721) 
i think example is probably the best uh they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionate so uh very spiritual young man uh more so than his brother and i always have to have to weigh that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel 

Recording: (4380/ 10721) 
so you know what i mean we had more fun on our own uh where i grew up i grew up like i said right over here on on tents you know used to be a pond over here at the military we would go fishing there every yeah 

Recording: (4381/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (4382/ 10721) 
totto toot them all or on top of them all thirteen years umhum umhum umhum umhum uh i was going through divorced parents both parents passed away uh my ex moved to uh saint louis and did not tell me anything but other four clothes it on the house and 

Recording: (4383/ 10721) 
they have to get a larger police department to do that that is another thing the city has grown so much that we do not have adequate protection i do not think anymore 

Recording: (4384/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4385/ 10721) 
and until the consumer becomes on the equal knowledge level as the because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the devover is something well let us see well we can make condos down the size of a little bit of a really want to make this we want to make this margin of profit yeah we do well what about for society is best interest 

Recording: (4386/ 10721) 
yeah and and never got any better then they got in marching band and they were in that for four years and sometimes we noticed they marching and sometimes they did not because they did not learn their music but they stayed with it and i said then they have like volunteer donna cosi they did not get paid a dime for this but they did it because they enjoyed helping and definite like they go we want that student over there said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us and you over there as a b student have proved that by gosh you know you will trial for something 

Recording: (4387/ 10721) 
probably but they do not they will not you know part of it is they feel flattered part of it is like wow the you know this guy thinks i am nice looking or whatever 

Recording: (4388/ 10721) 
uh do you like that 

Recording: (4389/ 10721) 
i know i 

Recording: (4390/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4391/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (4392/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4393/ 10721) 
yeah so they are like uh not american ways you know 

Recording: (4394/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4395/ 10721) 
um we are using his aunt right now i mean she stays home with her daughter and she is got one on the way and so she watches him while i am in school it is not in a long period of time only there until ten oclock 

Recording: (4396/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i applied for it and went after it aggressively 

Recording: (4397/ 10721) 
it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be a like you know like a laz earth or something like that you know or i i bunch of places you know like electronics appliances uh uh 

Recording: (4398/ 10721) 
that is good 

Recording: (4399/ 10721) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i mean fact of the matters they are to deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (4400/ 10721) 
oh i 

Recording: (4401/ 10721) 
do you think that we would be ready 

Recording: (4402/ 10721) 
from high school and uh one in that original group of kids that i had never did pass them all but i guess he is not worried because he is going to work for his dad and his dad is so he is going to be okay but he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but and the questions are not the same that i mean there are several different forms every time they send out the test it is sealed in a box and nobody is allowed to open up at the principal and then he has to be distributed 

Recording: (4403/ 10721) 
this is my consent to let you use that  yeah 

Recording: (4404/ 10721) 
i just renewed my certificate last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can range hours with a student that is at home for some reason uh i had one that just had a baby  and uh they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover 

Recording: (4405/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4406/ 10721) 
and she got divorced when i was three 

Recording: (4407/ 10721) 
we met at ohio state um yeah everything revolves around ohio state uh i worked when i first started working here i was working as an orderly in the operating room for ten and she worked in the intensive care unit so i have only been in the maintenance area for maybe ten years also i do not know it just i do not know it did not seem like it was heading anywhere and i wanted to start doing something that was more career oriented now i do h h v a 

Recording: (4408/ 10721) 
he he wrote a song probably the most famous one it is called green grass and high times forever it is i do not know if that was it was called 

Recording: (4409/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4410/ 10721) 
time he was right and wrong and i watched a lot of rather violent tv violent movies all that kind of thing and uh and 

Recording: (4411/ 10721) 
but we are working on it we have got a couple of hospitals in right now and see how things go 

Recording: (4412/ 10721) 
i think it is true you you do not vote because you think i do not want either one of these people what is it matter 

Recording: (4413/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4414/ 10721) 
two seven eighteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (4415/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (4416/ 10721) 
from family  umhum oh yeah yeah but something i have learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i you know talk to is that you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of uh in your home type of thing 

Recording: (4417/ 10721) 
um i mean i feel i i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i feel something on and the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human right side was that if there you know on 

Recording: (4418/ 10721) 
 they cannot understand where you are coming from 

Recording: (4419/ 10721) 
she went to high school she just barely works at all apparently 

Recording: (4420/ 10721) 
studing music for a while and then studying chemistry  yeah no i i i did not think of any projects where i can use both  

Recording: (4421/ 10721) 
about the same time my friend got hers 

Recording: (4422/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4423/ 10721) 
and it is just like been so for him too this has been you know a a a real amazing road because by the time he was twenty eighty i had four kids and you know and and yet you know we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he is looking forward to he is thrilled about the the baby that my daughter is going to have but um i would have had a whole lot more kids you know i would have just kept having them and he said oh forest plenty you know he needed 

Recording: (4424/ 10721) 
but i am not sure how it is going to work you know i mean i i do oh i choose um web site is under construction oh my god oh darn it so then you know my aunt works here and all my cousins most of them graduated here so kind of want to follow them the flu but i you know i did some other ones you know email and you know if you have this program can you tell me something about it and and it was 

Recording: (4425/ 10721) 
right and and it sometimes that opens um the person up because a child they are so innocent and you can not help but love them and i know my mom had a big problem with the whole interrational 

Recording: (4426/ 10721) 
i have raised for most of my life 

Recording: (4427/ 10721) 
yeah i think i think they fly to omaha so it is not too bad that is pretty easy to get into 

Recording: (4428/ 10721) 
i i guess i like to do but not probably i do not know 

Recording: (4429/ 10721) 
i know that is why you have to get it recorded  it it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they are on a shoes they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count in kind contribution that western uh grand bond college which pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and uh the salary the conductor uh 

Recording: (4430/ 10721) 
pretty much anywhere in delaware that i can find 

Recording: (4431/ 10721) 
he wants to yeah 

Recording: (4432/ 10721) 
i mean obviously that is a long ways off um i i i guess i imagine i would be teaching in public schools so hopefully i could kind of get to  where i was but but i i do not know i mean maybe i do not know is that i i do not even know if is it double and really better than than to call them by public or 

Recording: (4433/ 10721) 
okay well a few years ago there was this big fuss that you know we have got to close some schools we you know in rome and strapping it is you know just the way the population goes and romance is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so it is close and it is just big studying they target it something to close well there is a big effort for the people his kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close the school so the board back down and changed its money the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there was not a money for it 

Recording: (4434/ 10721) 
but most most of the vegetables are available truly the zucchini the uh you will find your your green peppers smaller your i got a uh cucumbers the other denver is either so big it i tell you i do not think it was that long 

Recording: (4435/ 10721) 
yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school only time and i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealth here type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (4436/ 10721) 
like a double standard for black people they are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racist towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously they are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not wanna deal with um i mean it is basically the same thing yeah right 

Recording: (4437/ 10721) 
kids lives and to go to i mean he coaches baseball he coaches you know um basketball we do not miss anything you know it does not matter what it is 

Recording: (4438/ 10721) 
nope huhuh 

Recording: (4439/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4440/ 10721) 
where by my brother being in there uh being over there and everything you know he he was uh pretty upset that i did uh that i did that you know that i just really is not point to ask and uh and he said then you know end up with something do not go in a damn army you know 

Recording: (4441/ 10721) 
well i i i think we are oh yeah we are we are church goers but just to be going to church course is not is not being faithful i think it is just uh sharing yourself uh with one another in daily lives uh listing someone out reaching a someone where it might be that is the the mystery that uh i think our our our lord has given us 

Recording: (4442/ 10721) 
i mean we throw the book away on some of these other guys i mean they throw the key away on some of these guys and you know we want to set them in an an example and you know this one guy had one do you why two years ago so we really have to he is got to be in jail for five years you know then this judge i mean he is got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he is still and he is still a judge  monday morning he goes to work 

Recording: (4443/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4444/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4445/ 10721) 
because then you know what if something major happens then it is the fourth time then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to to help them and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like two years breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (4446/ 10721) 
oh man i wish i knew what to buy this week 

Recording: (4447/ 10721) 
oh what are you doing that for oh 

Recording: (4448/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4449/ 10721) 
right no 

Recording: (4450/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i i think that the stories have not been i i i mean i am some of my favorite like lines from the simpsons are where they are highly critical i uh one of my favorites uh when bart the one with where bart things he loses his soul which in some ways is kind of preachy um because i mean like lease it takes their positions like you know whether the sole is is real it does not matter but i love one scene where they are cleaning out the uh 

Recording: (4451/ 10721) 
and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student on example um it would be nice if we had more of an open environment schools and the teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talked to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way um just because if you are going to teach it to a a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of one would probably be making cracks

Recording: (4517/ 10721) 
absolutely 

Recording: (4518/ 10721) 
now i was in the marines but uh basically all we did was just go back and forth uh from like philippines to vietnam then from uh vietnam to whole uh 

Recording: (4519/ 10721) 
i said i did not want to see that you know i would much rather just have my own opinion what it is going to be like you know and go by what other people said 

Recording: (4520/ 10721) 
no i would be taking in foster kid i i raised a little boy from the time he was born till he was six well he was my friend she is a single woman and she wanted to adopt but she said you would not adopt if she he was gonna have to a child would have to go to day care and this was when my daughter was started kindergarten and i said if you get a baby i will take care of him till he starts school 

Recording: (4521/ 10721) 
but i am also in a number of volunteer choirs um the choir at the first military and universal church and and um a small choir where i work which i got the opportunity to conduct today  conductor was  the conductor was is uh not at work so uh i i do a lot of music in my spare time 

Recording: (4522/ 10721)

Recording: (4523/ 10721) 
they had a strong uh public uh support over there so it really a tight neck community it is uh quite different columbus needs a learned lot from the area and uh it is a matter of just uh putting uh get your hands in the you are practicing your faith which we 

Recording: (4524/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4525/ 10721) 
you know if if it does not effect them it is not there and if they do not have to 

Recording: (4526/ 10721) 
oh it will be 

Recording: (4527/ 10721) 
and it just sort of sparked an interest in me i guess and i just grew from there 

Recording: (4528/ 10721) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them about our school um i think a lot of it is is is really what you what as far as as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to have public schools and and they took advanced ap classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think that they have options 

Recording: (4529/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4530/ 10721) 
yes yeah that is right you can not get a seat there 

Recording: (4531/ 10721) 
no well one place is here one place is right across the street from it so i got two she is from just a road over from me 

Recording: (4532/ 10721) 
i think they should too i do i really do i mean and then it is and you are right that is not fair because then that is that is a way to 

Recording: (4533/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (4534/ 10721) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know just sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have loads of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed they had three 

Recording: (4535/ 10721) 
yeah she she had to talk and my sister and i attended and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little of scratch would go in you know as as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance it i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you do not want to put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (4536/ 10721) 
i answered it right  

Recording: (4537/ 10721)

Recording: (4546/ 10721) 
i used to when i was driving uh uh especially when i was going through the uh going to two seventy things you know i had people flip me off and stuff like that there was a funny thing one time a guy is flip me off because he was going slow and uh i got all pissed off about him and went around him and everything you know and i go to work point of national chemical and he pulls in beside me but yeah i look over at him he looks at me like you know i am sorry i mean you know

Recording: (4548/ 10721) 
i believe them  i do i it is i mean it is a very personal thing and that is what they saw most of my patients are head traumas so so they can not come up with some pretty wild stories but those versions are usually pretty clear and

pretty much uh lived here all my whole life uh i was born in somebody and raised and here in nineteen seventy two and i have been here since then i was born in nineteen fifty august twenty fifth uh divorced i have a daughter that be nineteen this year and they live in saint louis 

Recording: (4550/ 10721) 
on occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction you just can not get anywhere very frustrating uh but other than that columbia is a great city um i went to this is something different about me most people do not know that uh it it existed in the the twentieth century but i went to an all girl catholic school for twelve years uh there there are no boys and i was not in a classroom with boys until i got to college uh i went to college at right state university uh my parents could not afford to send me so i had to work too

Recording: (4553/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4554/ 10721) 
my family yeah see them face to face uh recognize them and they will recognize me but something transfbut because as i look to them unlike when they are on earth my goodness tought to learn the most negative thing about a person psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you see a on the thing you do not see the other ninety nine percent of the paper you see that 

Recording: (4555/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4556/ 10721) 
oh here yeah they gave us ten thousand here is a dollar that is fun 

Recording: (4557/ 10721) 
and i think eighty four 

Recording: (4558/ 10721) 
 since i said it 

Recording: (4559/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (4560/ 10721) 
 and then yeah i got the opportunity um a a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back 

Recording: (4561/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4562/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4563/ 10721) 
i i do not care about like how me do it like my mom even wants me to do hers over a summer okay fine 

Recording: (4564/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4565/ 10721) 
you said we are their government or something government stays out of things that is our problem government is in too too many things they need to be out of your nose that is your personal business they need to be all your business 

Recording: (4566/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (4567/ 10721) 
oh i am kind of mad at my team at the moment  

Recording: (4568/ 10721) 
you know it is it is just sad in our society that that is what it is turning to 

Recording: (4569/ 10721) 
i think i would like if you had to ask i would say i was a straight midwestern suburban but there are people that i go to school with and ashland is twenty five thousand like in the city 

Recording: (4570/ 10721) 
changing the words does not change how someone feels about something 

Recording: (4571/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4572/ 10721) 
well she she is interested in physical therapy is that what your wife is oh okay 

Recording: (4573/ 10721) 
i had um one of the lawyers that was being our judges at state um came up afterwards and gave me his business card and said if and when you get through law school you may a call  i was like kick and dooh keep that card  make a phone call maybe he will be like a maybe he will be like a you know full time pardoner when i when i get out um 

Recording: (4574/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (4575/ 10721) 
but she always she always put me first and i think that that made it a lot more positive for me 

Recording: (4576/ 10721) 
is that right 

Recording: (4577/ 10721) 
because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah you know so it is better just to so i know what they are doing and everything but i do not i am not old well 

Recording: (4578/ 10721) 
they go she is got it and they go to the next guy and then all of a sudden you are going off this and they go uh so it is not usually it uh where are you going and you are like uh uh yeah told me to and then they go oh brother you know so now you know the tension is diverted to use so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there real professional yeah 

Recording: (4579/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (4580/ 10721) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observations were but they are sure just  lines of 

Recording: (4581/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4582/ 10721) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (4583/ 10721) 
well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (4584/ 10721) 
or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save half of them it is better than yeah 

Recording: (4585/ 10721) 
we have a five hour course the first term of summer quarter 

Recording: (4586/ 10721) 
yeah the we did not really get the the video tape they gave us was half commercials and then  things like things they had to clean the um bill with cookbook i mean stuff like that but your you as far as actual parenting things like there was really nothing 

Recording: (4587/ 10721) 
on that 

Recording: (4588/ 10721) 
uh we are planning on moving in the spring 

Recording: (4589/ 10721) 
uh i would say eight of the  so the recent ones have been the actually but i like star wars 

Recording: (4590/ 10721) 
you know this apartment is where he is living and it is just god i mean seems like a hundred years old 

Recording: (4591/ 10721) 
you know so it is it is kind of the mentality my parents did okay without it then i do not need it 

Recording: (4592/ 10721) 
yeah it is quite an investment 

Recording: (4593/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4594/ 10721) 
has to back it up but so that post plan uh trial for another year which pissed me on you know but that is exactly what they were planning on you know wearing me down like i said knowing that i do not have the money to throw in there and say hey you know um but they know for a while that we had all the evidence that we had too so uh that just post upon it for another year 

Recording: (4595/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4596/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (4597/ 10721) 
well we did not even have computers 

Recording: (4598/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4599/ 10721) 
uh mostly accounting and things like that uh such as a countable for nursing homes and things like that pretty in depth um some of the day but you know if i just go for a day it is filing and whatnot getting loans but most of the jobs actually you learn a lot so 

Recording: (4600/ 10721) 
we had uh counter battery fire we called up which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was and uh scary uh we were in a position where we could fire on a a uh tank it was going on we had a four four word observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i do not know how many 

Recording: (4601/ 10721) 
that in just twenty years and possibly ten each and every one of us in the world are going to be intercon but once again it is an impersonal uh interconnexion i will be able to contact you when you are over in paris and i will be over in in ogdo on out to our own farm and i have probably watched in the geese swimming up and down to the little lake and you are sitting over there and paris having a uh 

Recording: (4602/ 10721) 
so i spent about six months my life in the yard 

Recording: (4603/ 10721) 
it was so amazing to be back in america  

Recording: (4604/ 10721) 
nobody knew about yet and now it is like a parking lot every day so it is just a lot of different stuff about you know that and i do not know so it seems like you know activities to go do things everything is more crowded it is you know my wife thinks the cities the eat out city you know everybody if you go anywhere at six thirty everybody and their brothers eating out all the time it seems like constantly we live near a a 

Recording: (4605/ 10721) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be able to find enough to know that this is going to be something she is going to have the rest of her life um i will tell you what with today is a hundred and some of these fourteen year olds that look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and no they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is just for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the

Recording: (4671/ 10721) 
yeah there is like people calling and talk about other like they saw it and this other art mail order catalog that i have never heard of either it is i do not know how really they do it like it is just like they get people is names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and if people go back or whatever 

Recording: (4672/ 10721) 
oh i know it is so much fun 

Recording: (4673/ 10721) 
i do not know i do not know  i am sure it would happen because there is all kinds of whacky people out there  seriously i do not know i have family members that are homosexual that is just my own personal thing belief i do not know i think that is they should not have taken it off of the dm s whatever it was  i do not know 

Recording: (4674/ 10721) 
no they are all 

Recording: (4675/ 10721) 
they they could have taken other i mean well they killed all these people off but they could have you know put them into the background you know had them do a couple of shows a season and then had you know i do not know the adventures of uh oh agent spender and oh what is what is her name but then they they it killed off all those like supporting former ex files associated people 

Recording: (4676/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (4677/ 10721) 
i think it would 

Recording: (4678/ 10721) 
oh i can not think too much of them right now but uh yeah 

Recording: (4679/ 10721) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (4680/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4681/ 10721) 
you are right or called a nor shop umhum 

Recording: (4682/ 10721) 
people can not understand 

Recording: (4683/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (4684/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4685/ 10721) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it they are just really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take it advantage that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay on that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work 

Recording: (4686/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4687/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4688/ 10721) 
if if if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per per per precinct one vote per precinct you know they are just been wanted just no vote either way and any of those precinct you know he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two 

Recording: (4689/ 10721) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put out an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do probably remember one in playing with computers for most people as being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (4690/ 10721) 
hit the marks sometimes so  he gets to clean the toilet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (4691/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4692/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (4693/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4694/ 10721) 
would be would be interested in i mean i mean not just for the kids sake but would be interested on their own rehab in in teaching the child what uh 

Recording: (4695/ 10721) 
right and and they were actually able to select a couple from a they talked to a lawyer who ranges options and she had a file and they you know through kind of a bunch of questions and answers type things we are able to limit to the three couples and they like the first couple they met so 

Recording: (4696/ 10721) 
just can not move there a little bit uhhuh yeah uh i got a service my parents were older and uh kind of felt an obligation to be around to help take care of him 

Recording: (4697/ 10721) 
i mean i i was very good in math um very good in math i mean i was i did pretty good in all of the  checks 

Recording: (4698/ 10721) 
but it does not always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the the guy that they uh uh excuse it here in ohio last fall did you know about it you 

Recording: (4699/ 10721) 
that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peers opinions because i i for one example the pockety mind craze my son did not know what pockety mind was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff it is just like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know 

Recording: (4700/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4701/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4702/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4703/ 10721) 
it would be nice but no um so 

Recording: (4704/ 10721) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4705/ 10721) 
i keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know uh because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young i have a five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking eleven years so 

Recording: (4706/ 10721) 
yeah and he is got control over that because i i mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman um that baby sits and she did very very well she did all that stuff that i would like to be done she took them to the library she had nap time at a certain time they were in you know lay down and it is just totally different uh uh the grandmothers 

Recording: (4707/ 10721) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (4708/ 10721) 
you know and i just thought i just do not i just do not like this is not because this is something that when i look long term is something that i want to do with for the rest of my life and i said no it just does not you know and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible with somebody before you know people get into situations and they marry people that you just you from the outside you can look and you can think hey you are nuts you know that is never going to work  you know so i think that you just can have to take into consideration you know are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to that is going to work and be positive so 

Recording: (4709/ 10721) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (4710/ 10721) 
i i i would find that hard to believe  

Recording: (4711/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (4712/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4713/ 10721) 
i would say of uh i think the the the v eight generally sees on the average five to seven ten something like that a day and not all of them homeless 

Recording: (4714/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (4715/ 10721) 
she said that it is like uh some people are work there like i could not imagine working complete nights you know i mean i like working two three two eleven i think i would rather work like maybe like noon to eight that would be better because then it is like i mean i am more uh tend to staying up late anyway it is just because of like oh it is whatever but like i do not want to have to get up really early either like i can never imagine having a nine to five child like that would be horrible 

Recording: (4716/ 10721) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (4717/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4718/ 10721) 
the government is always good for money  

Recording: (4719/ 10721) 
 but it was interesting uh they did have uh enterprises where they they had religious somebody is um religion was not uh all it was not all invasive in this school but they did have a bed for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking uh it is 

Recording: (4720/ 10721) 
umhum umhum but uh but it was like i say i say she probably probably thinks the same way now she would been here you know and have trub board boys and everything you know when she was growing up and that part would have could have probably would have been an hassle but that kind of stuff depending on how how bad 

Recording: (4721/ 10721) 
um it is pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part um not so much they are getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (4722/ 10721) 
well we were we were at that we were in vancouver so it is not that far away we did not hear about it for a couple of days but i heard that it is all that was on every aspect of his life every aspect of the search but do people really need to know that do they need to have it driven home and i think then and i think at that point that is where the media are just there is been um 

Recording: (4723/ 10721) 
to the other side 

Recording: (4724/ 10721) 
as a law that you uh you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me for so i came it back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but but uh i i know the territory i know where i am going  yeah 

Recording: (4725/ 10721) 
no i think i through out on stress  i think it keeps me uh going or something but i do have to do something that is accomplishing something i do not want to sit in an office of already done that day and day out working for other people that i do not even approve of that are making way too much money anyway you know and after 

Recording: (4726/ 10721) 
okay uh i have two two um students well one should say there is two two children one is a student here currently 

Recording: (4727/ 10721) 
and then on out in the enemy was over there well they put us in the front of that mountain right down 

Recording: (4728/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (4729/ 10721) 
uh i make side a little side debts not necessarily money you know just hoff or fun sometimes i did get money for it though it was not too bad i mean you know it is not like some kind of racketeering deal  

Recording: (4730/ 10721) 
uh i seem to 

Recording: (4731/ 10721) 
um is it hard to keep up with 

Recording: (4732/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4733/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4734/ 10721) 
i start at the real bottom of it 

Recording: (4735/ 10721) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (4736/ 10721) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunchtime because that is the big meal of day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (4737/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4738/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4739/ 10721) 
cooking though 

Recording: (4740/ 10721) 
uh in a way and then over the next two three years my sister comes back and forth in actually four years comes back and forth between i lived here for several months i lived there for so much 

Recording: (4741/ 10721) 
uh i did have a white kid my son living there and that is about it 

Recording: (4742/ 10721) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (4743/ 10721) 
and i do not know common is i do not i did not miss bus service i kind of missed because um aaron is car is out on west campus but i went home and got my dad is apathy  he teaches in the dental school but he only teaches on fridays so he has that apathy available all the time  so our car is parked right next to the building 

Recording: (4744/ 10721) 
not so much when i was teaching it because i think 

Recording: (4745/ 10721) 
oh they are helping out the the new guys 

Recording: (4746/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4747/ 10721) 
 the they are they are the they are the the majority huh 

Recording: (4748/ 10721) 
yeah it is true and she likes it she is really good at it and and drives me my stuff down crazy because she always says like hey can you come over and put these cabins in and i do not want yeah i know 

Recording: (4749/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4750/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4751/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4752/ 10721) 
okay that is good 

Recording: (4753/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4754/ 10721) 
to approximately a thousand which his son is mainly operating now yet he goes out and works too uh helps out at at this age uh but he is concerned because they have just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developer to come in and already they are ready to take over a couple of farms that are fairly close to him but but it affects the whole township and one of the things 

Recording: (4755/ 10721) 
you you got 

Recording: (4756/ 10721) 
which but with the purpose of these books i suppose 

Recording: (4757/ 10721) 
i do not know that is transmedian we go right that down because i do not know that name you know so umhum 

Recording: (4758/ 10721) 
in tangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bring about the speriod in a person that is going to carry them all through life she is also uh tithing more than tithing probably uh which uh i always this uh kid with people i said the author uh said ten percent tithing new inflation he knew great about economics ten percent is ten percent and 

Recording: (4759/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (4760/ 10721) 
well and i think it really it still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy you know what i this way would that make my mom because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know that oh and they learn by watching you do it too i mean my

yeah it is a really discipline school but it is a lot of rebellion at the same time 

Recording: (4778/ 10721) 
yeah we did we had uh um it called land parties there parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook them up to into a network and then you play games 

Recording: (4779/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4780/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (4781/ 10721) 
so you knew you have heard about that probably 

Recording: (4782/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (4783/ 10721) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much raised as i mean it is whereas if you are my supervisor i am and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4784/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4785/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4786/ 10721) 
that is that is going to be a problem they said bring bring water you are going to definitely like they have no dress code which is nice so i am just going to wear shorts some good walking shoes and a and a tshirt because it could get rough you get real rough by that 

Recording: (4787/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4788/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4789/ 10721) 
i think it would help i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people 

Recording: (4790/ 10721) 
multatoryers the way i was raised um are you planning on staying home after you uh 

Recording: (4791/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4792/ 10721) 
i always had these uh spare old notebook and she stopped and got an idea for a poor maybe from something she was working on i do not know what but anyway uh she did she wrote quite a few columns some of them were real good okay i thought most of them is more or less not religious nature and moral nature and 

Recording: (4793/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4794/ 10721) 
so she is doing it and uh 

Recording: (4795/ 10721) 
yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4796/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (4797/ 10721) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they will probably be exposed to you know the gay lesbian i i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex classes were pretty but on the other for me that was fine i do not know our friends that have a eleven year old that is going to public school i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (4798/ 10721) 
not at all  he is always had very definite opinions of how his life should be 

Recording: (4799/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4800/ 10721) 
the protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so uh i wanna go on the wall  did not want to go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept hounding me and telling me you know uh maybe you could get in it to make a difference so i am like why would i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a lawyer i bring them 

Recording: (4801/ 10721) 
like 

Recording: (4802/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (4803/ 10721) 
yes so i do not know i i think a lot of it is the family unit breaking down in general you know and secondly i think to be honest i think the media has gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it um and i do think that you know they know they are going to get recognized they are going to have their name go down the history unfortunately um i think that has something to do with it too um it is frustrating to 

Recording: (4804/ 10721) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (4805/ 10721) 
i see i mean you see the computer can not be wrong he said 

Recording: (4806/ 10721) 
 much 

Recording: (4807/ 10721) 
no i we actually had student tickets that people did not want clear up on the seatback um but we enjoy it because we a lot of times we walk in 

Recording: (4808/ 10721) 
oh because some of the newer whoseets there is like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it is they are pop planes that are like five times as noisy 

Recording: (4809/ 10721) 
and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in the plumber is coated fabric is plant which is and i mix oh coated fabrics i make uh the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and their fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (4810/ 10721) 
yeah you got to remember it was all swamps back when i was a kid uh like i said i grew up down here it was mostly farmland when i grew up around here 

Recording: (4811/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4812/ 10721) 
some of them are athletes they are pretty much just preppie student council i am good at school but bad outside of school they go out and party outside besides school but they join all like the students against drugs programs 

Recording: (4813/ 10721) 
now i have not been over there since then  

Recording: (4814/ 10721) 
it is like you know yeah like a hundred dollars a week no in one week oh man 

Recording: (4815/ 10721) 
it is a good place they even stop playing the ghetto music this is juke box and it was horrible it played the same three songs with like horrible offensive lyrics and no melody so ever 

Recording: (4816/ 10721) 
for me personally um family being close uh both sides of family are here um for me familiar with from middle yard i do not like i have changed a lot of new things um for me i was involved in i i swam for old she was swimming and got real involved with it was she sports and just sports programs and i love a high state football so i i like the sports there are a lot of activities to do too now with my little boy going to coast side in the zoo and 

Recording: (4817/ 10721) 
have of germans are those of bavarian uh and not real bavarian but stereotypical bavarian uh beer drinking brought worth eating sour crowd eating later hose wearing uh you know 

Recording: (4818/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4819/ 10721) 
back in the early seventies and then i transferred to worthington in seventies six and i have been there ever since 

Recording: (4820/ 10721) 
i will bet yeah 

Recording: (4821/ 10721) 
yeah he is yeah he is twenty six 

Recording: (4822/ 10721) 
yeah exactly that will solve the problem 

Recording: (4823/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4824/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4825/ 10721) 
they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if uh if a kid has bad behavior or you know a bad sentence that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know the least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting playing you know hot wiring 

Recording: (4826/ 10721) 
oh wow 

Recording: (4827/ 10721) 
okay i am thinking people who who backbook a pretty cool you know 

Recording: (4828/ 10721) 
oh yeah they should they cut open they are uh pulling this baby out of this little hole of his lady is stomach and i just uh i had heart surgery when i was younger and so i have had lots of needles and those types of things and i when it comes to needles and and that kind of stuff and just kind of squeamish about it you know so that stuff i just i just do not want to see it 

Recording: (4829/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (4830/ 10721) 
of the year i mean it just got to the point where i would had enough and i did not want to go anymore 

Recording: (4831/ 10721) 
but right now with his attitude the way it is i would say that me and my family are better off not having him steering up a bunch of conflict or whatever 

Recording: (4832/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4833/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4834/ 10721) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school  because there were pregnant girls in my high school yeah 

Recording: (4835/ 10721) 
and uh well actually a neighbor boy whose draft number was smaller than mine 

Recording: (4836/ 10721) 
she does not does not sound right to the airwaves or to the riding some is misterious going on here and you find out they are did not have difficulties well the voice became acceptable before it was a no no and that was acceptable and then you had uh the celebrities becoming more than all oh hey we do not we do not we do not get no okay then we have the idea of doing away with cash gold metal the metalic backing i think it was kennedy was the one that did that 

Recording: (4837/ 10721) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (4838/ 10721) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know with pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out there are some of being worried about i i a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it about it so yeah but you know i it is i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (4839/ 10721) 
okay one two three four five testing testing  when i was to keep my father got this tape recorder and the days when there were those big you know the wheels 

Recording: (4840/ 10721) 
would you hold it 

Recording: (4841/ 10721) 
that is what everybody when i tell people i play it that is what everybody says but it seems to me that any instrument can be hard depending i mean i can not see how anybody can play a but there are some things that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with the single fingering 

Recording: (4842/ 10721) 
and you uh it is just like the game battle ship pretty much you know a four a two eight seven and um well i will have a three dollar one i have one probably four out of five you know and that i have not bought that many of them but in that rate right there four out of five is not too bad got my mom one on her birthday she got fifteen dollars and um 

Recording: (4843/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4844/ 10721) 
uh maybe maybe i like i said like it is really weird most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because i have lived in ohio for so long but when there is littles when i think you learn royalty like i love the old detroit tigon from the eighties and like that is what i learned to to like 

Recording: (4845/ 10721) 
umhum yeah i you know if it is nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (4846/ 10721) 
it is always going to be somebody that can complain about something but well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toes but you know that is about all that they want to do is far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because 

Recording: (4847/ 10721) 
and they can not find it and and you know and you know like our area look on the catalog where it says m e m number that that is that would be your membership number and people are gone all right but  i do not know like i i really do not i really want to get a job that is like in a warehouse or something something real easy where i can just like load boxes or something because i never have time to really i mean like i am trying to do like kind of i am trying to do yogurt but it is like we work two thirty two eleven so it is like by the time you get home it is 

Recording: (4848/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4849/ 10721) 
i mean i i i do not know uh enough about it to really say but it i can not i mean it i do not know where they got that 

Recording: (4850/ 10721) 
she was but i admire her more  because um until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going it was just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of a democratic party they would nomination such people as uh mcdonald who had you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line left 

Recording: (4851/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4852/ 10721) 
but our belief is that it did not it it needed to be restored and and we believe mean i do not know if you have heard about joseph smith or 

Recording: (4853/ 10721) 
sure um i grew up in limo and which is only about an hour and a half from here north i came here in nineteen ninety one i believe here being columbus um i got married about three years ago and right now i am in the process of general and everything i have worked all my life um until about the past two years and i have just been working like part time and um doing crafts and things like that because i am 

Recording: (4854/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (4855/ 10721) 
they are going to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they are doing 

Recording: (4856/ 10721) 
yeah but 

Recording: (4857/ 10721) 
in adequate but that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you get a special conference is to get information on that 

Recording: (4858/ 10721) 
i mean get the hell of it  

Recording: (4859/ 10721) 
it all gets i do not know it all works itself out he he every other day you start them on taxes and he will just start fumes 

Recording: (4860/ 10721) 
kids start dressing and getting in a click together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that is that is not really should be their role but um if they care enough they should call the parents and say well look we are worried about your son he misses a lot of school or he is starting to dress really you know i sometimes it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress 

Recording: (4861/ 10721) 
double e major 

Recording: (4862/ 10721) 
okay so uh he got dispelled from catholic school for behavior problems 

Recording: (4863/ 10721) 
do you think 

Recording: (4864/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (4865/ 10721) 
not i not really i mean i do not think they would come to any more difficult conclusions than guys had coming up to 

Recording: (4866/ 10721) 
helps the curb  

Recording: (4867/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4868/ 10721) 
i do not know i uh the those kids are uh they are like something in the rub them bringing and i do not know what it is uh thank goodness none of my kids ever took that sort of attitude and and uh i would like to i would like to think that my wife and i set them a good example oh 

Recording: (4869/ 10721) 
um yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of med school get your phd and then do your last two years of med school 

Recording: (4870/ 10721) 
so we walked across the street to the church 

Recording: (4871/ 10721) 
he is 

Recording: (4872/ 10721) 
yeah yeah and they are all sort of talking about because uh uh the actors the the reason they are ending it is because the actors do not want to do it there was talk i do not know if they are still pursuing this that they would have new characters take over the role and i mean the character development is the most important part i think um so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that there will get least things kind of open 

Recording: (4873/ 10721) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway  but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more orbit of finish towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of uh not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much  yeah yeah 

Recording: (4874/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (4875/ 10721) 
so they knew that this bush name would bring out a lot of money which it has he is got a lot of money to work with and you know that does not seem fair either i do not think you know the average person in the united states the average person uh does not think that your politicians should be bought you know 

Recording: (4876/ 10721) 
yeah i guess i just have the nerve to scratch and stuff like my rings all twist them because they bother me like i do not wear this all whole lot and  it is one of the days i did 

Recording: (4877/ 10721) 
disability and i have uh different abilities now you know same abilities i used to do but i have to do them a different way um just because my brain functions on a different level and i can not explain that to anybody and i should not have to but i am always forced to um but uh trying to find a job you know uh consulting from this has been difficult and uh and it is you know 

Recording: (4878/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4879/ 10721) 
but he would bring in a nutritionist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (4880/ 10721) 
does not 

Recording: (4881/ 10721) 
it is the grocery we use yeah 

Recording: (4882/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4883/ 10721) 
so he did it it well he is always had some problems his uh his saying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can get him away from it um if it is something he it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or so working on a writing assignments or something they had a half hour to work on it 

Recording: (4884/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4885/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (4886/ 10721) 
hunting and everything you know i do it when you shot something that that died it was not a it was not a game you know uh and i would hate to think that that would cause some kid to go off with a rocker and shoot somebody else who she or no human being i mean that does not i do not even know why there should be any concern for i guess so uh 

Recording: (4887/ 10721) 
uh his own kp one day and uh he said they had a big an area held away between any of the other buildings where they were in trash and that sort of stuff so he said uh and that is hard to say uh she make her ticket in a trash out and uh and burn it you know probably better just take some gasoline to throw all that stuff to get it to burn so 

Recording: (4888/ 10721) 
put plastic oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here at a high state where they have a union and they have so many different gills in a union you think of unions you think of auto workers you think of type fitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (4889/ 10721) 
umhum it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is good it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to to sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to believe you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (4890/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (4891/ 10721) 
he is the one yelling in their house and you know he is the one cursed and causing all the rackets but 

Recording: (4892/ 10721) 
uh my my sister is particularly religious and that that tends to warper her view of everything 

Recording: (4893/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4894/ 10721) 
referencing is when i speak you know when i am hanging out with friends so and mentioned a a subject and i am like hey simpson is made fun of that you know at some point uh uh that is the effect that it sees on me i do not think that is too big of an effect people are always used to you know like quote shakes or something i guess that is ten times more elevator so like oh but the references to the shakes line or something but i mean it is it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it and 

Recording: (4895/ 10721) 
hot wiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do not know i think i do have sort of a very strong and all 

Recording: (4896/ 10721) 
because see well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talked about that the only you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (4897/ 10721) 
 yeah i do not know where they are going now but 

Recording: (4898/ 10721) 
i could not imagine being locked in a room for like a few days 

Recording: (4899/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4900/ 10721) 
and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and thing for myself and so i mean exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not and so when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in in a lot of trouble about um the whole racial thing because uh i remember in a school where i was miss sleep white students were 

Recording: (4901/ 10721) 
yeah yeah and that is the thing about the schools too you know and totally disagree with uniforms you know unless it is all slacks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms and they are short and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said hey you know here this is you know him and met me and 

Recording: (4902/ 10721) 
well i think it starts with the family but the problem is in the last three years we have ever used uh i should not say thirty years push world war two push world war two is where he broke the family up uh and let me tell you how i i realize this during world war two we took the little lady out of the house and said hey we need you on the production lines make more machinery 

Recording: (4903/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4904/ 10721) 
what 

Recording: (4905/ 10721) 
nope 

Recording: (4906/ 10721) 
you know and and you are gonna be so awful and he is just real supportive and and just he is just traffic so  it makes it does it makes him better 

Recording: (4907/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4908/ 10721) 
and he looks he looks more you know like that side of the family and i was and he was bored and we could not believe it we did not know there was red heads on my husband is side to the family and then we found out that he had a greatgrandfather with red hair and blue eyes 

Recording: (4909/ 10721) 
you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it is individuality again so 

Recording: (4910/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4911/ 10721) 
uh earth science uh it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (4912/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (4913/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4914/ 10721) 
yeah yeah  equal distance 

Recording: (4915/ 10721) 
i will start asking you questions but 

Recording: (4916/ 10721) 
yeah i was and because where i was i was working at a recruiting firm and we were doing we had a lot of business before and um and i i was pretty during the during the morning and afternoon and basically you know we talked about it and i just decided to go ahead and just take some time off and i do not know i also went back to school then too so i figured i take that time off and i am going i am going to ought or mind to get my master is in education 

Recording: (4917/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4918/ 10721) 
it is it is gone right and 

Recording: (4919/ 10721) 
 we 

Recording: (4920/ 10721) 
well yeah 

Recording: (4921/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4922/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4923/ 10721) 
and stick with it 

Recording: (4924/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah i graduated from math and high school uh and rolled in the ou for uh the winter quarter and pursued a part of that out and at the time 

Recording: (4925/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4926/ 10721) 
um i am a pr major right now hoping to get into computer animation 

Recording: (4927/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (4928/ 10721) 
under a house but it is just more time consuming soon than i think i am ready 

Recording: (4929/ 10721) 
um you know i i just got back from a year in england so i am not sure about the new 

Recording: (4930/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4931/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (4932/ 10721) 
but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen yeah well 

Recording: (4933/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4934/ 10721) 
like that i just i think that is going to be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there is one off of uh basketball or no it is off of henderson and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i could not even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so i think it really affects it yeah 

Recording: (4935/ 10721) 
that is our planet 

Recording: (4936/ 10721) 
you know on the council and that kind of thing so you know he is a democrat you know go out and uh i and i said well okay you know give them a shot anything but 

Recording: (4937/ 10721) 
true 

Recording: (4938/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4939/ 10721) 
it felt innocent to me and i like that um because all the other times where they have started to kiss it is always been like stereotypical romantic and that is like wow two friends alone it is new years perfect you know it was not it was not like they were going to jump in the sack or anything like that 

Recording: (4940/ 10721) 
do quite a do how to do it so that they can learn the other cultures and the other values but they just do not do any of them 

Recording: (4941/ 10721) 
it is like being that with this adoption of the baby we know that that is best but dealing with the emotions of it this is uh it is great we are very family oriented and it is this is a grandchild we will never see

Recording: (4968/ 10721) 
um i i see it as a problem and if i if i if i were african american i would i would not like to see it simply because as uh you know it is it is it is a a child not being brought up in his you know in his tradition but on the other hand i hate i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orph when he could have a home and um i think uh parents who were willing to 

Recording: (4969/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4970/ 10721)

Recording: (4981/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (4982/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4983/ 10721) 
right there is a lot of uh money money in town here and there is sometimes like you will see a uh one entire airplane that goes to cancun and it is like people are going vacation or people are going to go gambling and jamaica that is all it is so then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we are like who is that 

Recording: (4984/ 10721) 
no no he does not have anything he he will not talk to me yeah 

Recording: (4985/ 10721) 
i am just saying you know

Recording: (4987/ 10721) 
that they left out as he put it one of the orders that he pushed and pushed and pushed he wanted a specific part of that ordinance just say every so many people that move into this area you must provide for a school and it said of consequence and and it said they he said i push and pushed and he said i uh all the influence was on on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was going to produce more taxes 

Recording: (4988/ 10721) 
well like i am getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at 

Recording: (4989/ 10721) 
time to go all right i am down here 

Recording: (4990/ 10721) 
oh really  that is cute  

Recording: (4991/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4992/ 10721) 
oh  i do not what does it mean well it is you instead of going to your classroom you go into a room where you have you sit and and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can not talk or anything 

Recording: (4993/ 10721) 
they are they are wonderful and everybody always says the only reason i just do not know what you are doing we have come and take care of mine for me and it it is the fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions and i treat them everybody is such a mom is weird she talks to us strange it is because i talk to them like i talk to you at at whatever age they are you know i do not yeah i do not talk down to kids i 

Recording: (4994/ 10721) 
i was i was like no i would not i will let you go when i want  um like one of my friends he had uh a car alarm because he had some nice stuff in his car his car along went off during school and he said he put his hand up and everything and told her that he needed to go outside i because his car alarm was going off and um she said no you can do that on your time sit down you got all this stuff stolen out of this car so like 

Recording: (4995/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4996/ 10721) 
yeah that was rough 

Recording: (4997/ 10721) 
and then they are going to say they want to nail their parents you know their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what that kid is doing 

Recording: (4998/ 10721) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the library is connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out into the public working the public seeing to it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the way uh you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before and now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody 

Recording: (4999/ 10721) 
they know more knowledge i would not say they are more socially mature or more um um i mean there is even sweet little preschool girls that do not say please and thank you you know you have to remind them 

Recording: (5000/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5001/ 10721) 
with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh it is it is nice  well you could still go it is they will not have they will not have a lot of uh 

Recording: (5002/ 10721) 
you walk in oh my like oh my gosh uhhuh 

Recording: (5003/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5004/ 10721) 
yes i did 

Recording: (5005/ 10721) 
they have on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they sell it and move on 

Recording: (5006/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (5007/ 10721) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a psychology undergraduate so  yeah 

Recording: (5008/ 10721) 
um no which is very grateful he did like go pass my parents parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though it is public record like who owns the house um luckily we have not had that because we purchased the house my husband and i before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the either has my middle name on it but uh no luckily 

Recording: (5009/ 10721) 
so it brings that and it is like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools i will bet you they are all about uh 

Recording: (5010/ 10721) 
oh no  that is when you stay away from  yeah 

Recording: (5011/ 10721) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain  it is just coming down all over the place hail and lightning 

Recording: (5012/ 10721) 
i mean you could probably write about thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your how many years do you have two three 

Recording: (5013/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5014/ 10721) 
forty is like no limit 

Recording: (5015/ 10721) 
i think they need to educate me on what is important to them and i will you know i wanna and respect as much as i can but even people within different i mean a catholic is not a catholic yeah my opinion i mean there are some old time catholics i mean like my mom  i mean that they just are very 

Recording: (5016/ 10721) 
well now they do not 

Recording: (5017/ 10721) 
does not happen overnight 

Recording: (5018/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5019/ 10721) 
so really that is about it i have a dog he is outside right now and that is it for my kids 

Recording: (5020/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5021/ 10721) 
it would be a lot more accepted i think here even though it might be kind of i would not do that on my own but if i am i felt like that was what i was doing all the time so i  full time 

Recording: (5022/ 10721) 
 you know what i mean it is uh i mean i hope we are getting to the place we know that that uh 

Recording: (5023/ 10721) 
yeah and that 

Recording: (5024/ 10721) 
and everything that uh they will tend to talk to maybe you are talking to somebody else then uh like in a tortage figure not believe it to them what they say 

Recording: (5025/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (5026/ 10721) 
 yeah exactly 

Recording: (5027/ 10721) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background or something sort of i can not say see any real difference i mean for the most part they have would not be able to do anything else any guy can do so 

Recording: (5028/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (5029/ 10721) 
i want i do not want somebody i i want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (5030/ 10721) 
he can aggravate him i mean you get to be older you know this  some of those issues  can be very aggravating 

Recording: (5031/ 10721) 
see i do not want that to happen to me because i just that is um i mean i had a guy that i did start dating when my son was a baby but um it just he got he fell in love with me 

Recording: (5032/ 10721) 
i can not imagine that it would have i mean i am sure brazil would have been even more different experience but i think it was more just a resentment for sort of everything what what their said it was a real love hate relationship 

Recording: (5033/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5034/ 10721) 
um i i certainly spent most of my time in the areas that i grew up i mean i do not 

Recording: (5035/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5036/ 10721) 
one one uh uh of the families is in uh let us see oregon the coast uh forget the name of the town i am not far it is it is along i think it is along the coast in oregon uh near egypt or something like that and um the other is in louisiana i think 

Recording: (5037/ 10721) 
on the lousy line and uh uh leave it to be 

Recording: (5038/ 10721) 
yeah basically for the entire summer and then if i like it uh i will be i will be in a rolling so 

Recording: (5039/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5040/ 10721) 
he was tough but he was he was always tough and we did not realize it for years we did not have anything to compare to the only one kid we got uh he was very the psychologist told us you know we were talking about things that happened and we was going to say you must have had a terrible time raising him because he was not an easy kid we did not know any different 

Recording: (5041/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5042/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5043/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (5044/ 10721) 
but but if if that if that phd was given to you if they lowered the standards if they lowered the standards for you to get into graduate school it would not that be challenging for you hey great they lured it for me my sister did not oh she had a rough time getting the button now i can get anywhere i go to lewisville 

Recording: (5045/ 10721) 
those are unsettling times though you know 

Recording: (5046/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5047/ 10721) 
they probably would have been about seniors in high school or so 

Recording: (5048/ 10721) 
but that is because i am not home a lot and like i said my wife is here now her mom is just moved to texas so she is living down in texas and she is got brothers and sisters all of the united states 

Recording: (5049/ 10721) 
not in my lifetime you would have to probably be a closet gay 

Recording: (5050/ 10721) 
things that the catholic church will not like to admit that they are wrong and they are wrong um uh sit is there to ask me to atone for my sons yet they will not atone for the sons of all the police that are molested in children still to this day and they protect them and it is not right and i am very very uh outspoken about that so rather than bang my head on the wall to people that would not listen i just decided 

Recording: (5051/ 10721) 
stagged backbeats and stuff and like if i can play bass and like i i have like like a processor thing and stuff that i fool around i was just doing stuff like that and some of my friends like play on drum machines and stuff like that so i just do stuff like that more like it it is not it is not like you are playing like you are not spending records it is like it can 

Recording: (5052/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (5053/ 10721) 
yeah i have been a fan you know forever pretty much i did not really have any other teams 

Recording: (5054/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5055/ 10721) 
i think this year it is going to be even worse stocking up what or  

Recording: (5056/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5057/ 10721) 
um i think just having like uh such a low cost really helps 

Recording: (5058/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5059/ 10721) 
or listen hiked up her skirt and i rolled up my pin slug and well i probably not over knee deep but uh i think i have good talking to is all we ever got in on that 

Recording: (5060/ 10721) 
under whatever system that is popular that day um or car games 

Recording: (5061/ 10721) 
i even had that 

Recording: (5062/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5063/ 10721) 
i can not say you know i can not say that it is an expectation i i i still say that it has to come from the top down 

Recording: (5064/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah 

Recording: (5065/ 10721) 
there i just think you can not you can not call for across the board raises there are definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they are getting 

Recording: (5066/ 10721) 
it is in it is at the same building actually it is it is that it is used for different things 

Recording: (5067/ 10721) 
yeah they they 

Recording: (5068/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5069/ 10721) 
that i like i did not even recognize like that many of the names 

Recording: (5070/ 10721) 
just for the courses that i need  

Recording: (5071/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5072/ 10721) 
and that is adult 

Recording: (5073/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5074/ 10721) 
god um and breathing that it is like when we were in the womb of our mother uh we were breathing water we were breathing fluid um orchestgum is in that fluid too it is in that mess that goes over the the fields 

Recording: (5075/ 10721) 
he is seven months 

Recording: (5076/ 10721) 
i turned him into a zombie 

Recording: (5077/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5078/ 10721) 
so how many years did you actually were there teaching three years wow 

Recording: (5079/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (5080/ 10721) 
it is just very comical i was just like oh 

Recording: (5081/ 10721) 
the mall issue 

Recording: (5082/ 10721) 
uh it is just there we go again who is right who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (5083/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (5084/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (5085/ 10721) 
i am trying to work on my license for sky diving though uhhuh 

Recording: (5086/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5087/ 10721) 
and it is really sort of interesting 

Recording: (5088/ 10721) 
that are the big problem children because the you know mom and dad go how can i get them to do something and stay out of my hair oh i know i will buy them a nintendo i will buy them this they get i will buy this look they are out of my way you know because you know 

Recording: (5089/ 10721) 
yeah um um again i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of of college and then you put them with all these high school girls and these girls are looking twenty and twenty two i mean you can not even you can not control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can um put the 

Recording: (5090/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5091/ 10721) 
he would absolutely have to build my trust for a long time 

Recording: (5092/ 10721) 
good  

Recording: (5093/ 10721) 
yeah i work on the auction up there so i sort of avoid the campus i mean campus it is been a long time since i have been around here 

Recording: (5094/ 10721) 
himself in the two elections he ran in um most real democrats the war invading of the world and many you know congressmen and and senators dislike clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough um i liked clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either already do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a modern 

Recording: (5095/ 10721) 
it was probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (5096/ 10721) 
right after you are done doing all of the spiel about you know why you think they should accept christ in their life they say okay that is good for you and that is the general that is the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean which generation are we anyways i am i am twenty i am twenty so there is like the generation x there the generation right after me and then there is generation yfk there 

Recording: (5097/ 10721) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (5098/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5099/ 10721) 
yeah  after you learn to know her 

Recording: (5100/ 10721) 
the some of the classes i am taking are probably um kind of dangerous so like the fumes from the paints and stuff so i can not half two weeks until those are over yeah 

Recording: (5101/ 10721) 
for two bucks you know you can not beat that 

Recording: (5102/ 10721) 
uhhuh well you you had a good reason to be bothered 

Recording: (5103/ 10721) 
and the people that would be decent parent are not because of the situations and whatnot um just my nobody in my family my sister does not have kids have kids we are in our mid to late thirties um our friends just had one um i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they are just great parents i know those kids are going to be going in but then i have uh other people that like my other friends that just had one were trying to help but 

Recording: (5104/ 10721) 
and the cops will be there is and and now course it is just near me trying to be near me no idea what the hell is going on and   i i this this things in too and uh it was like you you do not you do they tell you any do you do you i have no idea what is oh and i could not do anything about i could not tell him i could not communicate i was totally incapable  yeah it 

Recording: (5105/ 10721) 
for everybody so you you want to go to ivy league you do not even want to look here 

Recording: (5106/ 10721) 
i mean may the middle brother was always around he was not very social in high school so 

Recording: (5107/ 10721) 
if you see that thing you can be ducking them you know seventy seven years old i can not imagine being hurt by them you know 

Recording: (5108/ 10721) 
yeah you can not say a known is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good 

Recording: (5109/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5110/ 10721) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to it would probably be even more towards the education line 

Recording: (5111/ 10721) 
sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and i i was reading a book and i let her out and i let her i can not even start reading again and i am looking our house and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know uh you live here it is not i think of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak  i am 

Recording: (5112/ 10721) 
yeah now if you the the the thing you do is if you know the call sign 

Recording: (5113/ 10721) 
so there was a a waddy they call him it was like a little deep boy 

Recording: (5114/ 10721)

Recording: (5144/ 10721) 
um i do not think that really matters honestly um i mean it is i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you are usually e eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by that time those kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they i can do not like um i can not see i can not see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being 

Recording: (5145/ 10721) 
most how 

Recording: (5146/ 10721) 
casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice uh you know gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the the foley of the ways and dying in the classic um tragic hero sort of way um and so i am looking forward to how they build up to that points um a lot of people have in high school they what the hell are you talking about though but uh um yeah i am looking forward to seeing how things 

Recording: (5147/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5148/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (5149/ 10721)

Recording: (5150/ 10721) 
umhum it was pretty far  the city actually had a million people that i lived in most of the time but it was the government that ran it actually was still um communist 

Recording: (5151/ 10721) 
so how do you know how do you know 

Recording: (5152/ 10721) 
and you either accept it or you do not or you know 

Recording: (5153/ 10721)

Recording: (5156/ 10721) 
we used to be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty two and it is yeah it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle it has nothing in it just it is just empty space over the over the worse up center so when you would sing in the uh as a choir you spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all the way to the back and but if you were under this flat feeling 

Recording: (5157/ 10721) 
oh i can whip up a mean fish especially when i go out we are closer to a fishing area now i caught dinner the other night and uh hack just about anything i can make turn in  i like to get a pat and on a certain kind of island i am not going to you know

yeah 

Recording: (5160/ 10721) 
i am not sure where my father would have been and my father was very liberal uh more so even than my mother um because if it is not something that is part of your culture everyday you know and and you have been told it is wrong and the catholic church said it was wrong is most most religions do i am sure he would have you know had some concern but i think his his intellect would eventually have worked it out especially if he sat down and talked with him and he would not have done you know there would not have been any gay bashing 

Recording: (5161/ 10721) 
need kids that kids like 

Recording: (5162/ 10721) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real weird too i was always like i mean like my friends were always like the because they used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or ever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the odd people and in a small in a small midwestern far mean the school is kind of odd i guess um um 

Recording: (5163/ 10721) 
they can not see nothing wrong with that 

Recording: (5164/ 10721) 
they had three uh 

Recording: (5165/ 10721)

um 

Recording: (5168/ 10721) 
i had to carry him but then that is all my wife taking over some my role at home so we swing him that is why i said a team player we knew what we had to do uh my son might come on and i said well gee you know you might be much more off my wife if say eight that is your dad give him respect 

Recording: (5169/ 10721) 
yeah because it is the midwest yeah 

Recording: (5170/ 10721) 
um a lot of on line magazines music magazines 

Recording: (5171/ 10721) 
yeah like have someone come and you know and tell them you have this much time or you know i would not recommend you stay on this program this long and i i know there is programs that if you get on the and they pay you you have to pay that money back after you get on your feet well i mean i think someone should be able to come out and tell you about these things and let you know what you can and have to do to you know do this 

Recording: (5172/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5173/ 10721) 
i told her well that is just my identification there you look on my license and nobody can copy that you see where the a unm is my last name 

Recording: (5174/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5175/ 10721) 
what was my kid 

Recording: (5176/ 10721) 
well at the time they are having a lot of trouble at school and they just want to get rid of some people 

Recording: (5177/ 10721) 
you do not go into elementary ed that much 

Recording: (5178/ 10721) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could have easily quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a clark public school and it they did not care i mean i i went through elementary and middle school with your aids and got there and i was on seats to these you know and it just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learn do you learn if you do not know if you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i am they are 

Recording: (5179/ 10721) 
a child and children services that came from poor 

Recording: (5180/ 10721) 
i have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (5181/ 10721) 
i was working out there well 

Recording: (5182/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5183/ 10721) 
i just well but i did not understand as much as you probably  i just like cld to what i needed to do to become an art major and i go to my adviser and they tell me what to take and it was the art advisors but i did not really think i had to do anything special like i do not know about the portfolio review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and then i just kind of went to come of state and went 

Recording: (5184/ 10721) 
she has already been to here twice badly and has accumulated all of forty four thirty four points 

Recording: (5185/ 10721) 
has not for about four years he refuses to refuses to live with us because we have rules 

Recording: (5186/ 10721) 
weve been on for hours like i did this morning but yeah 

Recording: (5187/ 10721) 
i never thought he was any better than anybody else you know he was always there to to help out if he could you know but then some people would not say uh some people were not that way 

Recording: (5188/ 10721) 
yeah that is uh the bureaucracy be too much of a struggle i think 

Recording: (5189/ 10721) 
no math is just you can say okay here is three blocks you can touch them one two three take two away now there is one i mean 

Recording: (5190/ 10721) 
okay  yeah i am in a uh in the guinea peck class of this program through medical school where after three years of undergraduate i go to med school here like without m cats or anything 

Recording: (5191/ 10721) 
that is that is what i would i would think in that case i mean i mean because the dominant culture i mean is always going to be accessible to them 

Recording: (5192/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5193/ 10721) 
i think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister is wet sticky hair because it is known to cigarette smoke for some reason so wet sticky hair went because i was crying into it and um and then more time passes so so i am in in determined length of time later um i i look over at the police officer who standing on one side and the cops are there basically to make sure i do not freak out and that finally funk in i was like the cops are here so you do not freak i am like well i am not really in any danger of breaking out and 

Recording: (5194/ 10721) 
because they like it they like school and that is why they came to college football was secondary 

Recording: (5195/ 10721) 
yeah that is how he gets so much money he says i will be paid this much and i will be given this many and have this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they just say no no no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a week later okay we will take you  you have some really good stories about that oh yeah yes golfing is in the businesses and also with uh unix which is 

Recording: (5196/ 10721) 
they are each other you know using the kid as a medium um or they are too selfishian do not listen to their kids or they did not i do not want to say selfish but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um not spending enough time with the kids you know they are working whatnot and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and 

Recording: (5197/ 10721) 
if you ever met somebody like that any 

Recording: (5198/ 10721) 
well it is well let us put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could i could be a crook and uh i could have people rent me a house and allow him to come i could move in there 

Recording: (5199/ 10721) 
and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it is like well thank you for coming oh thank you for coming so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who were not messing around with it have come back in so i i do not know exactly what the yeah  

Recording: (5200/ 10721) 
cough is uh catholician night for the faith that is uh she had gone graduate from my university of ohio and got familiar with uh camps for christ and so forth and went out to to colby and worked for northern illinois then went back working for the inner city area of chicago and for herself because she liked studentville better and when i relocated her people say you are crazy young lady you are twenty five you are moving to stephenville they are migrating out of here 

Recording: (5201/ 10721) 
and you you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now poor climbers you could not do that they went you could over there because you can walk around on the ramp over there and that always you 

Recording: (5202/ 10721) 
and that we should have never been in we were well let us see we come a lot around the mountain like there is a mountain here 

Recording: (5203/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5204/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (5205/ 10721) 
no i do not 

Recording: (5206/ 10721) 
to make me healthy or whatever because i have always been really healthy 

Recording: (5207/ 10721) 
which every kid in the world plays with 

Recording: (5208/ 10721) 
it was mostly caucasian and very few asian and other ethnic 

Recording: (5209/ 10721) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (5210/ 10721) 
oh man  

Recording: (5211/ 10721) 
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up you know uh a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business is the way it should be done they were not doing fall on pro to call and of course me i would be the one saying hey you are not falling on pro to call and they would say well you know i am i am i am a former addict i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (5212/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5213/ 10721) 
i think that basically that is it and the nut shows they have reached a point in their life where you know their their cow is as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by humum themselves to death or uh smoking you know whatever you know smoking uhprocrack or whatever and uh and they just living in the hell i mean 

Recording: (5214/ 10721) 
yeah exactly and it is just it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing umhum 

Recording: (5215/ 10721) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time uh and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh i think some of h gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it is uh you know it does not matter who i vote for they are going to lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was interesting but our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed 

Recording: (5216/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5217/ 10721) 
what i am saying when i talk to them or my mother very nice human being and a bunch of people i do not know 

Recording: (5218/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5219/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (5220/ 10721) 
some of them are all the above and uh some of them are not now there is quite a few of them that have adjusted well to society uh when it came home biggest thing i think when uh what what happened is that there was not any joy about uh like world war two and korea and their you know it was like you came most guys are plain and you know nobody really cares yeah 

Recording: (5221/ 10721) 
it is just a rule 

Recording: (5222/ 10721) 
right oh and i have and i am sure it will especially when you already recognize that you know that if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you are going to be uh helping along it is a lot easier than trying to figure out what is going on here you know 

Recording: (5223/ 10721) 
that would not bother me at all 

Recording: (5224/ 10721) 
she is an electrical engineer yeah um he started off here in columbia that she had really went out of business then he went to her being uh and they were space and um they ended up merging and now there is really no aerosplace things in columbus ohio so he is working for them in city which is um uh kind of heating and cooling air conditioning systems and so he is using the air flow to sign 

Recording: (5225/ 10721) 
not so much old star trek uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean you back when it was new i liked the next generation but when steve space nine came out and had a gritter darker story that was not so cookie cutter in fashion there was uh a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad people the the characters 

Recording: (5226/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5227/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5228/ 10721) 
like not really i mean i played we played with friends we never played anywhere just full in around like in people is basements and stuff like they were really organized enough to try and play anywhere else it is hard to be yeah like like real like you know like jim warring and stuff you know like the deads like that like i do not know like like like deads and more like kind of like reggae type stuff too 

Recording: (5229/ 10721) 
they get better and better and better i 

Recording: (5230/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5231/ 10721) 
i do not know it is like that is that is uh that is like you know that is i guess that is one way to you know to to get you into the into you know into the business but that is i do not know i do not know how you prepare yourself with teaching in front of a large audience that is like something you would have to like you know i would have to anyways use myself into 

Recording: (5232/ 10721) 
so yeah those places were probably about thirty years old i you know fire hazards insulation just you know fireheads it everywhere 

Recording: (5233/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (5234/ 10721) 
well well yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with it it is like a form of censorship you know big brother things librarians have always had problems with that um i i do not know it is it is hard to balance it somebody is out there actually doing criminal work a criminal activity causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that is to still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (5235/ 10721) 
um not really he i mean he obviously went to church too for at least a few years uh um while they are my parents are still together but i mean since then i mean there is really nothing about it 

Recording: (5236/ 10721) 
totally left that part out no one felt me in about and i was throwing up or anything that that really made me mad  

Recording: (5237/ 10721) 
it i  i do not know how to tell you that um i mean it it is 

Recording: (5238/ 10721) 
 uhhuh 

Recording: (5239/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5240/ 10721) 
well he is two main uh main characters in his cartoon and for willie and joe 

Recording: (5241/ 10721) 
in the in the us 

Recording: (5242/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5243/ 10721) 
that is ridiculous that is amazing to me 

Recording: (5244/ 10721) 
and um and then i my family moved to clinton valley and kind of lived up there 

Recording: (5245/ 10721) 
grand children umhum yeah 

Recording: (5246/ 10721) 
not really  

Recording: (5247/ 10721) 
i am not sure i mean i know no one is come to like hey you can get on this and you can get on that i mean i know my teacher she said i think it is called um eighty eight or something and they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (5248/ 10721) 
well there is oh there is plenty of stuff yeah well it is not like uh not like sex it is a little bit safer but  it is kind of you just go out with your equipment and if you catch one you catch one if you do not then you do not but i have caught plenty of dinners lunch breakfast and all that 

Recording: (5249/ 10721) 
it has this little bridge that goes up to the front door and a creek i mean it is cool 

Recording: (5250/ 10721) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (5251/ 10721) 
you know okay that is what i am doing wrong i will not do it again and then nobody asked me out for a few more years so 

Recording: (5252/ 10721) 
uh six years ago 

Recording: (5253/ 10721) 
see i would be all up in the room too looking to see what i i would be just like my mother was not even though i hated them but i was i would do that 

Recording: (5254/ 10721) 
there there could still be like a think tank of of executives that could be very liberal in their thinking and just you know for social for social not so much social change but you know not not um encouraging sweatshops within a corporation stuff stuff like that and i would like to i do not know how i would get involved in something like that but i would like to it would be interesting 

Recording: (5255/ 10721) 
you know and nobody does those sixty hour work weeks like some people apparently are accustomed to around here 

Recording: (5256/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5257/ 10721) 
who is got what necessarily i was going to hear 

Recording: (5258/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5259/ 10721) 
uh like you have to do something like it is more of a it is big recession to do anything you know you have to put on like all these coats were more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like go to the park and sit it is fine but like here you know you get slush everywhere and you got to think if it is something to do you just can not like drive around and waste time because it is the because it is miserable 

Recording: (5260/ 10721) 
where 

Recording: (5261/ 10721) 
i really do not think we did for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i do not really see too many sex problems i definitely do see guys still being 

Recording: (5262/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5263/ 10721) 
very much so 

Recording: (5264/ 10721) 
a fire all note books around and she is just right in them and uh since she passed away in nineteen seventy nine i have run a i well i just i finally just signed my those boat books are down there and if i need one for something i will just go ahead and use it and i have run across a couple of her mornings but i did not know anything about 

Recording: (5265/ 10721) 
i do not know uh she does not book anymore and she has to i am the one that loves to exercise  

Recording: (5266/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5267/ 10721) 
it is a cartoon i believe it started out 

Recording: (5268/ 10721) 
yeah it is my daughter yeah umhum 

Recording: (5269/ 10721) 
okay dripping yeah 

Recording: (5270/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5271/ 10721) 
there is no there is no there is no concept behind it yeah you are right you are right to some degree they uh area commissions are supposed to work on that and no unify i i used to be on the university area commission and and the and that is one of the things we work on although we some of the other commissions in columbus are almost strictly architect they will only talk about 

Recording: (5272/ 10721) 
 so made me squirm a little bit always in my seat that happened i was kind of like i know who he is talking to   my my mother is two sisters married southern baptist ministers 

Recording: (5273/ 10721) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help kids because a lot of times maybe to they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5274/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5275/ 10721) 
so i can sleep in 

Recording: (5276/ 10721) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with the bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems um and i mean that is really that is really all that i know is just obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (5277/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5278/ 10721) 
and you learn what you have to do to get through the test course i did that when i was here at school 

Recording: (5279/ 10721) 
i did not like his life no  

Recording: (5280/ 10721) 
and obviously a lot more dangerous and i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like college or whatever 

Recording: (5281/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5282/ 10721) 
there was a little bit well quite a bit of it was yeah some of the people in the group did not play sports but it was not all from one sport or another it was football ball wrestling it was usually like the best football players the best wrestling 

Recording: (5283/ 10721) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (5284/ 10721) 
that did yesterday but when we at society say oh gee he struggled against it well let us lower the this thing bar let us load the bar a little more let us yeah gosh darn hey  scooney you did not make that last shot last night hey hey time out let us get screedy two more minutes make let us live in the other shoot he gets two more minutes to try and get it 

Recording: (5285/ 10721) 
you know you would have to happen stand just happen stand us on to it or something you know uh uh i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the uh with the the guns you know the bail billy and more people having guns that do not know do not should not have them apparently uh you know they should be uh law under law talking key uh you know as for the you know the parents somebody is responsible for it you know but see the 

Recording: (5286/ 10721) 
but it was not because it caught fire and that time he was born on the back 

Recording: (5287/ 10721) 
i mean i am all for anything i could do the sales i could do you know the purchasing thing i can do i i pretty much can do anything that will be i can be taught to do 

Recording: (5288/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (5289/ 10721) 
no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yes the baby is going to be born i i think he just kind of tried to ignore her for a long time but i think it is all for your help is now uh and she is she is great 

Recording: (5290/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5291/ 10721) 
against them in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5292/ 10721) 
yeah they went and won the super bowl and they went back and lost the super bowl so 

Recording: (5293/ 10721) 
that was always too subjective for me 

Recording: (5294/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (5295/ 10721) 
i was going to say most of them are 

Recording: (5296/ 10721) 
for the rest of my life and so be it you know i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there but thats yeah that is basically where i have been you know um i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college and played baseball um due to injuries you know and knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro caliber you know uh i played baseball with uh with paul and 

Recording: (5297/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5298/ 10721) 
i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew is baptism and my grandparents you know and that is the only time they will find me in there you know i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow them now and uh and actually seeing things for what they are and it is frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that is okay um well the lawsuit uh 

Recording: (5299/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5300/ 10721) 
in his own mind regardless it is part of that bad spirit that people have created the devil not satan to the native people he does not exist and to me he does not exist he is stupid but he is real 

Recording: (5301/ 10721) 
um either real playing games 

Recording: (5302/ 10721) 
yeah you know like you know that that that it typical american tourists 

Recording: (5303/ 10721) 
she did but we were out 

Recording: (5304/ 10721) 
and um i do not know i think having just having the word on there gives it some kids enough prestige that they do not totally freak out about not going ivy yeah 

Recording: (5305/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5306/ 10721) 
would make any difference or not 

Recording: (5307/ 10721) 
not too far from here 

Recording: (5308/ 10721) 
really i have not noticed that yet hm 

Recording: (5309/ 10721) 
because it was also a nice like a hundred or such a pretty round number 

Recording: (5310/ 10721) 
probably it is you are right i i asked him what language did he have to learn to  

Recording: (5311/ 10721) 
then when i found out there were so many openings and special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy has a very good background for ld because a lot of these elderly kids have language deficit and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorally so that is the perfect background to work with all d kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (5312/ 10721) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and within your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all for them to yeah there is a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (5313/ 10721) 
you know and they work hard you know to make it easier on the students you know they totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (5314/ 10721) 
all that plus by the time you get to first grade you are supposed to have but oh the number she used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them in order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred you are supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (5315/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5316/ 10721) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (5317/ 10721) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody uh getting mad at somebody you know you might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (5318/ 10721) 
so if the family um smell the area and um just the community i think crime i think is going uh been up um traffic is around us with the ones but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is spending so much that we need the 

Recording: (5319/ 10721) 
yeah  ooh and um um you know at the time i was like i am not going to get anything in this and it was misery and what not but i have met people that have been in much worse situations and at least i can kind of relate to them 

Recording: (5320/ 10721) 
uh you know just always just active and he is always been very active in sports but when i put him on the well and he was um laying on the couch you know just zombiebyed out 

Recording: (5321/ 10721) 
like talking like i am at work you know so it is like like i do not know if they have the phone like 

Recording: (5322/ 10721) 
to melt and soften the metals so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire you have ever touched or been around and that far or a sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down 

Recording: (5323/ 10721) 
great 

Recording: (5324/ 10721) 
 that is right 

Recording: (5325/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5326/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5327/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5328/ 10721) 
oh yeah and i i will probably step on your toes here but i i i am not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was at home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you 

Recording: (5329/ 10721) 
he just looked at me like what are you talking about with it he is maz that mean when i talk to him 

Recording: (5330/ 10721) 
yeah so uh you know i felt like you know uh the players small would benefit columbus and uh all all the way around you know uh as far as uh you know what was going on with that jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about north of mont 

Recording: (5331/ 10721) 
thirty forty thousand it is international yeah 

Recording: (5332/ 10721) 
um they have started again recently uh they sort of hit the same point where they would just had enough of it to and stopped 

Recording: (5333/ 10721) 
depends on how i store it now when i was a kid raised up we had gun locks on our guns even though i could pick them i mean 

Recording: (5334/ 10721) 
you know i mean so it is true um with different pets 

Recording: (5335/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5336/ 10721) 
you are worrying 

Recording: (5337/ 10721) 
if he wants to yeah anybody is capable of changing if they want to 

Recording: (5338/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5339/ 10721) 
even i hate hearing myself on tape too 

Recording: (5340/ 10721) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it 

Recording: (5341/ 10721) 
yeah it is uh that it is on all in tangy down there north of there 

Recording: (5342/ 10721) 
yeah like when i do the silk screening and this it is kind of random but just anything 

Recording: (5343/ 10721) 
is extraordinarily similar uh so what she says might not might be diameteral close to what i say 

Recording: (5344/ 10721) 
there generally tends to be at least one or two republicans that vote for each each each election and sometimes i vote as straight democrat because i just you know i even vote for george hitter the first time she even ran for county commissioner uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and i i like what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i i did not vote for her after that but the first time she ran for county commissioner i did it one because she was a woman and i like you know i it was not possible i would like to vote for women 

Recording: (5345/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5346/ 10721) 
he had a variety uh eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his better year uh he was taking a had taken computer class for eighting period and uh it was not going well they were teaching keyboarding well he learned that when he was in third grade so we were talking to the teacher  says well he is disruptive he is supposed to be doing key boarding exercises and he is writing programs so it was and he said i 

Recording: (5347/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i tried and tried i just said see it i did not change it i and i you know you keep hoping you you just keep hoping but it is all upon and obviously he does not love me enough to really want to change and settle down he still wants to do those things he is doing and i just need to move on 

Recording: (5348/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5349/ 10721) 
somebody is watching and 

Recording: (5350/ 10721) 
well muggings on the subway or stuff you know just in general 

Recording: (5351/ 10721) 
the women i can not say i really ever have a relation with or whatever unfortunately although i do not like it yeah i do not know i just i am pretty into size of a person i do not like making decisions and she is kind of the same way so when it comes to what we are going to do or whatever it takes us hours to decide what we are going to do it i mean it just gets a snower 

Recording: (5352/ 10721) 
is that the way jesus christ what brought that here you do something about that if you do not then i will realize what a stifling less person you are but you will never find me in your church again so i have done what i have done but there is a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spiritual quality and they will become selfproclaimed spiritual leaders uh 

Recording: (5353/ 10721) 
parmits the 

Recording: (5354/ 10721) 
uh i plan at this point to pursue history to the phd level uh anything of course can happen 

Recording: (5355/ 10721) 
but they just do not have those 

Recording: (5356/ 10721) 
it is due just summer second but she is already dialating and everything so the doctor had said before thanksgiving he thanks you know 

Recording: (5357/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5358/ 10721) 
right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months over and he worked every day 

Recording: (5359/ 10721) 
there was just something about that stink far better far more than a paddle a paddle was kind of a whop and then it was in that sort of thing and it kind of got your attention man you are there is another warped in the state okay that is first that is right murderers you know we murderers now by that police bar that police bar and i think you know or i do not think they should have ten years of uh what do they call that for legal process 

Recording: (5360/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5361/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5362/ 10721) 
yeah i would like to go out there overseas somewhere 

Recording: (5363/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5364/ 10721) 
gays gays homosexual and all those 

Recording: (5365/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5366/ 10721) 
i think it is the right position to take um but it like abortion that is one of the the big issues that divide people very quickly um i i think it is moderating somewhat uh as the gay activists continue their campaigns um but that is one where kennedy has to tread very carefully um i was proud that coleman said it and did it and and did not back down on that um they told me a little bit about his character um i 

Recording: (5367/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5368/ 10721) 
uh usually whatever ones i can find uh and you got columbus alive and it is just not quite that 

Recording: (5369/ 10721) 
i was living with my mom in like half and half like between custody or whatever i was living with my mom and half half with my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him and then uh my mom ended up move getting remarried and like my dad is remarried by that time too and um remarried and this and they lived moved out to sunbury and like this house on five acres or whatever and so then oh when i came back i just lived with her up there 

Recording: (5370/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5371/ 10721) 
usually clinton bell my mom she um she does not she is not a big fan of driving she does not really drive very much which is good i have ridden in a car with her one time and and because she just would prefer not to and we that is okay with us because she she is got a driver is license for ida those types of things but for the most part so she kind of stays like the clintonville area yeah 

Recording: (5372/ 10721) 
that is okay too 

Recording: (5373/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5374/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5375/ 10721) 
i do not 

Recording: (5376/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5377/ 10721) 
yeah in fact he uh let us see i i i do not remember i suppose that they had a and he was about twenty one 

Recording: (5378/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5379/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (5380/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5381/ 10721) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded  

Recording: (5382/ 10721) 
do you want this doing or be this this and that some people will some people some people will say that i feel sorry for those people i pray for those people because prayer are the most powerful thing you can have that is going to get you through nothing else okay what is how long you are having from you you are putting his hands you know enough faith to practice it he will come through it may not come through it was the way you think it is you want to do but somewhere along the line you are going to say 

Recording: (5383/ 10721) 
like they have this they have like two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens and like could you imagine like 

Recording: (5384/ 10721) 
sixteen 

Recording: (5385/ 10721) 
that you went back to 

Recording: (5386/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5387/ 10721) 
people that were pushing the free speech get smogged or you know anything else happens to them 

Recording: (5388/ 10721) 
you know it 

Recording: (5389/ 10721) 
okay  

Recording: (5390/ 10721) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am married i do not know if i am married or what well hopefully do not know their true identity eventually 

Recording: (5391/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (5392/ 10721) 
so therefore they can they are not public they can put whatever they want 

Recording: (5393/ 10721) 
love it  

Recording: (5394/ 10721) 
um so i just can not down here then 

Recording: (5395/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (5396/ 10721) 
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if i slept at night instead of staying up 

Recording: (5397/ 10721) 
and i am really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me though it is like oh you come on i do not really want i do not want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff i just want to get going and do the rest to the stuff so 

Recording: (5398/ 10721) 
i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers and i said yeah you can make money with computers and i said what could i make money with computers 

Recording: (5399/ 10721) 
believe it god 

Recording: (5400/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (5401/ 10721) 
three years i have them usually i have them six seventh and eighth for those language art subjects unless they get some miracleous cure and they get right now i am phasing the kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still a terrible speller but he he is not lazy and he does this assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspelled something 

Recording: (5402/ 10721) 
yeah much too fast for me you know my 

Recording: (5403/ 10721) 
yeah that is what it is it is a marketing thing 

Recording: (5404/ 10721) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (5405/ 10721) 
there were things out but there is nothing like what they have today you know small little handguns and things like that that are really as easy carryable and cartialable i mean like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things like that i mean i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (5406/ 10721) 
so he uh you know he was strictly a union man you know so he kept his he believed in the unions you know so the railroad was was union you know 

Recording: (5407/ 10721) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (5408/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5409/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5410/ 10721) 
but you can also you can also grow with respect you can work with the community and still gain a respect from community and you will haveed but you know now they just we do not have any of the loyal at all it is out the window uh and that is the way for your the most you are saving the money yeah big deal you are going out there for what you want well maybe somebody want oh cause the only service okay boom disposable that is a problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to commute 

Recording: (5411/ 10721) 
you know that is a real major question is not it uh no i do not think it is too bad i mean uh well uh well we could go into the issue of uh the columbus board of education what is his name he is always 

Recording: (5412/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5413/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5414/ 10721) 
most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or whatnot um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and on the streets anymore so they do not have to catch them they do not have to process them et cetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really 

Recording: (5415/ 10721) 
no thanks 

Recording: (5416/ 10721) 
i think when you have two or more pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (5417/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5418/ 10721) 
like it is like we are taking catalog wears over the phone and it is not really a big deal like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us we just wear college shirts and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they too they yell at like nice like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we could not hug and they were like no that is like you can not hug in here or something like that you know like it it takes away from professional attitude like i do not even know what to say to people like that like this is like such a different 

Recording: (5419/ 10721) 
but it is uh it is necessary for the way i follow if it is especially for men women have a purification my 

Recording: (5420/ 10721) 
i am a senior 

Recording: (5421/ 10721) 
and everyone would be all right with that 

Recording: (5422/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5423/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5424/ 10721) 
it is nice you have a real nice arts festival every spring you ever get a chance to go down in march 

Recording: (5425/ 10721) 
they are kind of like more isolated here in profield 

Recording: (5426/ 10721) 
so we have even been known to slightly start pulling out you know let the garage door go down i would sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she is on the couch and she is like i am go out  

Recording: (5427/ 10721) 
yeah i hope we are going to get there  

Recording: (5428/ 10721)

Recording: (5431/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5432/ 10721) 
you know nice dog and uh because they do not wanna make the time to train it and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time and discipline and love and care just like a child 

Recording: (5433/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5434/ 10721) 
that is just weird 

Recording: (5435/ 10721) 
you know of course a lot of that you know hinge on the fact that my son is a student and they are very pro education you know so my son he is back home now but i wish he he would go too uhhuh he just joined this maternity 

Recording: (5436/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5437/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5438/ 10721) 
i i say you should look in what we did is look in the newspaper and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years 

Recording: (5439/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5440/ 10721) 
so you have how many gets 

Recording: (5441/ 10721) 
yeah i contribute it to too many people there is too many people there is not enough commitment it is too easy to get divorced and uh um the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of um just people everywhere and young people today i do not uh you know i do not know what the statistics are going to be but they i do not think they have a good idea of what marriage even is you know before and also before marriage was a commitment to uh 

Recording: (5442/ 10721) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (5443/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5444/ 10721) 
they would not no i went to two different doctors and they said you possibly will change your mind and you know i was single uh maybe if i would have been married they might have considered it um but they said no way would they do it and we are talking fifteen years ago 

Recording: (5445/ 10721) 
but uh the company wanted to move florida and he did not want to move 

Recording: (5446/ 10721) 
umhum i mean probably down the line because like we are still struggling to get up you know we are waiting for that million dollar they are that 

Recording: (5447/ 10721) 
it is like like sometimes do i think about people you know they call and and especially when i talk to sometimes people call in and i i talk you know i get the same people or whatever oh it is well especially if like there is people have this real specific weird name or something that i can remember oh they will call back and i will think about them as like how i have this you know like we have this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it is like to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like and they 

Recording: (5448/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (5449/ 10721) 
they are five hours from colorado so they still bad lands are not too far away and i guess it is like nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive they come at least once twice a year back to ohio 

Recording: (5450/ 10721) 
you know it is not a big established gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available you know it just could walk in and show anywhere and um and so i you know i met a lot of people doing that and the i mean i am mainly friends with the same people i met then you know people are not as my age but um it is been and there is you know i i do not belong to any formal groups in columbus but um it is a it is a real strong network of people you know everybody knows yeah well

Recording: (5473/ 10721) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help 

Recording: (5474/ 10721) 
yeah i mean but i mean we are not in a depression and and the you know the employment rate is fine and health care is we have got some improvements there and like i said that  long sing on other things and look at all the money that we wasted where we could have spent that money on something else you know and you end up doing that

Recording: (5480/ 10721) 
yeah yeah that the worst part there a lot they could really double they took our neighbor is in the sixth grade and they took how old elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade

umhum 

Recording: (5485/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5486/ 10721) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the i suppose that they would be adopting them they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (5487/ 10721) 
eighty eight so we just we just had our loved his wedding anniversary yeah 

Recording: (5488/ 10721) 
with out being with them 

Recording: (5489/ 10721) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial world world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to just use like you said well i the necessities 

Recording: (5490/ 10721) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (5491/ 10721) 
and colin pine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not 

Recording: (5492/ 10721) 
today is society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would talking talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing and our uh early life uh we did not even know what our nickel or a dime was uh those that was unimportant and we also were talking about how uh how we uh went uh uh he was telling me a little bit but i said let me stop you paul i said paul what

yeah 

Recording: (5496/ 10721) 
and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three or four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (5497/ 10721) 
umhum right 

Recording: (5498/ 10721) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is driving force for our of our of our government and and even like because without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations they could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they have become fairly powerful but i do not think that is necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because 

Recording: (5499/ 10721) 
uhhuh and it is still over here it is over a hundred percent over here well whether we are in this universal or local or massachusetts or whatever kind of things are over here uh john does here he has some famous movies and jane does is over here on the personal is yeah yeah umhum

Recording: (5536/ 10721) 
they say oh no we do not want all right say let us get a foreign exchange student this would be fun 

Recording: (5537/ 10721) 
so it you know she would have been going to north when high school which is up there just a lot up where i am living in one fifty one cleveland area and uh so it would have been interesting yeah but then you know the in the other side of it you know the uh the women tend to have the more emotional type of feelings than uh than men you know we carry on our shoulders you know so uh they just uh 

Recording: (5538/ 10721) 
well it probably would have been yep but they felt that i would change and uh i have also been a vegetarian for twenty two years and when i first decided to do that every and oh you will change way to get married you will you know and i do not eat any animals at all um and it is was just a conscious um decision 

Recording: (5539/ 10721) 
left their uh part of it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so yeah that was probably one of the biggest problems i had but uh 

Recording: (5540/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5541/ 10721) 
i hit my my head was that far below the surface  

Recording: (5542/ 10721)

it was about a bunch of teenage ravers 

Recording: (5549/ 10721) 
uh yeah well um i think the teachers are every bit as good as but i think there seems to be uh the whole administration up through the board and just it it is not as gist you know i do not know how it is great it is like the teachers are so sort of it seems like they almost have the feeling they are on their own what 

Recording: (5550/ 10721) 
and i heard the thing you know you are not my real father and all that we want to do all that 

Recording: (5551/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5552/ 10721) 
now we used to do uh fifty cents you know a game you know just to win back the quarters and plop them in you know not too much camping on that part yeah 

Recording: (5553/ 10721) 
um uh the the the public transit system i mean i know they are doing the best they can but i do not see how we are ever going to get out of this without light rail and i am really bummed 

Recording: (5554/ 10721) 
right on the top 

Recording: (5555/ 10721) 
um in a fight and they just said that we want to be um looked at as just other kids you know in high school but yet when they were their makeup and they like their hair and they have all these pure things you know it is like they they do not want to be like everybody else 

Recording: (5556/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5557/ 10721) 
i do not i do not know if that is what permanates it it is very different in the public schools and the catholic school and the public school you know have all the problems of society in the school you have the drugs so you have the absentee parents the delinquency when the catholic school they just you do not have that fun thing you know it is oriented around a church you know or not catholic it is still oriented that so there is a lot of values thepermines and everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that is the way it is going to get ticked off it is the wrong 

Recording: (5558/ 10721) 
or to stand on our own or anything but you know we wanted to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independent we used to sit stupper and uh onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even if it is six and seven years old and tell him 

Recording: (5559/ 10721) 
yeah i live in uh subaru um 

Recording: (5560/ 10721) 
tooks 

Recording: (5561/ 10721) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go yeah 

Recording: (5562/ 10721) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two guns so and that is me was but my high school is is two thousand people so i guess by ear numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (5563/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5564/ 10721) 
i do not know if if it really if you really feel like the their that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really you know and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they they do not ever really put anything in the action and it is kind of skied along you know and i do not know if there is anything substantial i can say that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected um economy is fine i mean so it is not that he is not that he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing you know 

Recording: (5565/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (5566/ 10721) 
on campus how are my dead body you know he is not allowed down there

Recording: (5568/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5569/ 10721) 
yeah i thought it was gonna be like not so structured but it really is and like especially i mean it i know it is like all first year classes are basically the same and it is just kind of like i do not know i thought it would be different like more of uh like more of an adult type thing when really it is just they treat you the exact same way like uh i do not know yeah i think that is true and like i lived in 

Recording: (5570/ 10721) 
no right person they are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (5571/ 10721) 
um i mean the second matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no affect on the kids because they should still be uh normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (5572/ 10721) 
there is a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (5573/ 10721) 
to people who do not get along and we look at the problem it was centered on that uh i i am getting off topic i wanted to voyager what you were saying with the the the uh generals i i like at first having uh captain and jane wayne being a female in the leadership standpoint but i i still think that uh the the women on the show particularly seven of nine um are are used as sex subjects 

Recording: (5574/ 10721) 
so i do not know just lucky  

Recording: (5575/ 10721)

just getting himself settled under the community and and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while um most of my really childhood memories are from where where we lived in man isfield it was uh it was a real it was a real do not talk do not ask community i mean you really did not know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi they never came over so yeah yeah yeah we lived in the suburban area 

Recording: (5655/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5656/ 10721) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quiet and they are not going to you know um look at this flatter 

Recording: (5657/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5658/ 10721) 
when i got here but i was in one of those you know used stupid uh psychiatric relationships shall i say and i kind of needed to to disappear and um we never told him where she she had just moved

yeah i go to class 

Recording: (5661/ 10721)

Recording: (5662/ 10721) 
yeah probably 

Recording: (5663/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5664/ 10721) 
uhhuh i read it 

Recording: (5665/ 10721) 
vandalism yourself serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases even change you up and beat you in public for it um i think not to say it is not too vential but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it um i think just the fact that the jail they are so overcrowded now that they know that they are going to get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are you are not even going to get thirty days in jail and you are going to 

Recording: (5666/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5667/ 10721) 
twenty years ago 

Recording: (5668/ 10721) 
something you can figure out what it says from the context you know so we are in the process of phasing him out so that he will not have to he is had help i think since he was in kindergarten that is the another thing that is really in the stigma about these kids ninety percent of the time they are i suppose like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean they are very bright but something is not 

Recording: (5669/ 10721) 
no it would probably be something with this foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 

Recording: (5670/ 10721) 
this is a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know with uh uh the vietnamese guy uh vietnam guy getting his brain blown out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out what do that you know so if anything it made me want to not want to do it you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army 

Recording: (5671/ 10721) 
definitely i am such a slacker here it is great 

Recording: (5672/ 10721) 
um yeah yeah yeah we did not go to court uh 

Recording: (5673/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5674/ 10721) 
so we are we are talking extraordinarily a little bit more understanding of what computers are how they work so class one was famous to find a computer we took it apart we labeled everything inside i gave them all a piece i said but i think that we turned it on we saw if it worked we went back in figured out why it did not work and took it a party down and this was not something i can do hardware because hardware has no money in it but um it was so that they are not scared of the magic box 

Recording: (5675/ 10721) 
okay oh okay so 

Recording: (5676/ 10721) 
we both love sports um we love college football 

Recording: (5677/ 10721) 
and the safety of the neighborhood and it there are a few things really to go into it 

Recording: (5678/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5679/ 10721) 
i do not go to city center too much although i like it being there if i want to go to it 

Recording: (5680/ 10721) 
you know the stuff like that has always been around but it seems now that the guns are more you can get them easier well it is like me i could be carrying a gun right what are they going to do to me 

Recording: (5681/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5682/ 10721) 
it is better in terms of the uh city government seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they are doing and it is not oh well i will just do this it is kind of like you know there is some brains down there  

Recording: (5683/ 10721) 
being goofy  

Recording: (5684/ 10721)

Recording: (5687/ 10721) 
the morning back 

Recording: (5688/ 10721) 
no no they did not um they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or searching anything  so right but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it uh i liked the in today is class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it  right they had a when they told me i i 

Recording: (5689/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5690/ 10721) 
and makes her look good 

Recording: (5691/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5692/ 10721) 
and make me be ten thousand dollars profit but um and she would say well i do not know for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea and finally she says i do not know it always works out for you you always get that so just do it and it is just some situation kind of thing 

Recording: (5693/ 10721) 
uh how many i do not know it does not matter uh but in in many ones that were too hard for me 

Recording: (5694/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5695/ 10721) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but 

Recording: (5696/ 10721) 
around more than somebody else 

Recording: (5697/ 10721) 
herry yeah like oh my god what did we do like my grandmother is name was olive when i was born my dad said boy she looks just like your mother to my mom and i have turned out to do everything that she did i have turned out to teach she was a teacher i have turned out to be you know real good in the kitchen and baking and i do like craft like she did knitting and crocheting and i do that but i am sure god did not name me all of 

Recording: (5698/ 10721) 
yeah you are not allowed 

Recording: (5699/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5700/ 10721) 
no no i mean it is kind of a traditional light at the um like a big tenor was up right light at the end or they were floating above themselves looking down at and so that the accident scene um seeing a dad relative something like that 

Recording: (5701/ 10721) 
i mean we were like when he was fourteen years old we would not let him go out and take a walk at a little three in the morning and he could not understand that i am sorry  i do not think that is being a bad parent to tell you no uh 

Recording: (5702/ 10721) 
okay well i am not adopting that real and fortunately the judge of our game is at listen to our conversation so i feel kind of safe  i am your true friend uh uh much better friend of mine than of hers but she is more attractive than i am so we figured it all balanced out we decided that made him unbiased 

Recording: (5703/ 10721) 
well he he yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum it was just like he taught seventh grade they gave him math science um supposedly um books for the kids i do not know if you heard that they he had not bought them books and so we had to buy them and  i mean they got reimbursed but if 

Recording: (5704/ 10721) 
umhum yeah and then my other sister just recently got divorced um this year or i guess it was um final end of last year and and she is got two kids and raising them and so they are all um most of them except for uh linda and bobby bobby is the one in uh connecticut and linda and akron but everybody else is within ten minutes of each other 

Recording: (5705/ 10721) 
uhhuh and that is what i like about it is the ambience and the the river and uh oh oh and the apartments are just very very plain yeah but uh 

Recording: (5706/ 10721) 
oh my 

Recording: (5707/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5708/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5709/ 10721) 
see i am not sure if universal health health care the uh i think it was my freshman year my sister and i went to donald is ed the uh 

Recording: (5710/ 10721) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (5711/ 10721) 
um not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage are going to go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually this is a very hot topic in england right now because they are they have got the highest 

Recording: (5712/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5713/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5714/ 10721) 
then you are really going to get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (5715/ 10721) 
and you can hit the road if you want and of course the only thing he had was nothing 

Recording: (5716/ 10721) 
where it took me to 

Recording: (5717/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5718/ 10721) 
they 

Recording: (5719/ 10721) 
yeah well and people is people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you you know  did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that to me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along i know  taking up space no  

Recording: (5720/ 10721) 
not much 

Recording: (5721/ 10721) 
and i think this past year they had two murders over there and i was publicized in the clumbus area but uh it is 

Recording: (5722/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5723/ 10721) 
and that is what we did and so he is just like my own too now i go and volunteer he is in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it is kind of like i hope i get to do this forever 

Recording: (5724/ 10721) 
i think in in a month they show you those i am sure you guys took those classes they are horrible they take seventeen hours of labor they put it into six minutes and you think oh my god i am gonna die you know these little bit of it i i just let you die yeah you are like why are you showing me this 

Recording: (5725/ 10721) 
and i have always felt good about it but people always said oh you you do not even claim you know like a wendy is ham or anything and once you make a decision like that you do not crepe things like that you do not even think about it 

Recording: (5726/ 10721) 
yeah he is your  yeah so uh things pretty much in columbia is public schools you know they will they will actually sit down with you they automatically assume that once you get to this level you are ready for this level and you go on 

Recording: (5727/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5728/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (5729/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5730/ 10721) 
she is granted she uh she is expanded her horizon if you will and 

Recording: (5731/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5732/ 10721) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (5733/ 10721) 
right um 

Recording: (5734/ 10721) 
they should once go to columbia state uh once again into one of their engineering tech programs uh umhum and i i hope she does because she she never sit in a high school she is very bright she is mature in so many ways but she is had to be responsible for herself her whole life um 

Recording: (5735/ 10721) 
honey is school two years after high school to pay my way through college um taught school for about eight and a half nine years and during that time got my master is degree in remedial reading um um taught for i think i said it is about eight and a half nine years and my life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teacher is association or teacher is union and that led to a job in political action because i would always been active in politics from high school on uh the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in nineteen sixty 

Recording: (5736/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5737/ 10721) 
in a heart be trying to help them but they do not i do not think they make an effort to like put out any you know 

Recording: (5738/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5739/ 10721) 
they are they have a very nice standard of living all of them do 

Recording: (5740/ 10721) 
and so they offered to move them back 

Recording: (5741/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (5742/ 10721) 
that is about right that is about right  i think it is just general central you know that is yeah well 

Recording: (5743/ 10721) 
and it was pretty it was fun to be the first class in the school because everything is brand new 

Recording: (5744/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5745/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (5746/ 10721) 
oh you have so it is like i mean when after i heard that i said my that is not even worth going to be very good 

Recording: (5747/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5748/ 10721) 
but i i had a no den before i had the heart attack i had already had two heart attacks i had a no den and i needed to be on the first shift or i would probably have another heart attack and they would not i put me on first shift then i had another heart attack put me in the hospital then i had another heart attack when i was in the hospital and when i came out that is when i gave them another note state i need to really be on first shift 

Recording: (5749/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5750/ 10721) 
it was 

Recording: (5751/ 10721) 
we 

Recording: (5752/ 10721) 
up to us what we wanted to do we were we would get up leave at nine thirty and be home by nine thirty or whenever it got dark 

Recording: (5753/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (5754/ 10721) 
just a teeny bit 

Recording: (5755/ 10721) 
uh he was a uh railroad clerk 

Recording: (5756/ 10721) 
texuality yeah 

Recording: (5757/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5758/ 10721) 
once it was filed the judge uh scheduled a hearing and for whatever stupid reason um the soon as they could hear the case was one year from the day that we found so you can see when you get in to bed with you know and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit or whatever you know any kind of lawsuit uh 

Recording: (5759/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5760/ 10721) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again it is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bar tend responsible but say you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it somebody else 

Recording: (5761/ 10721) 
and then i am probably going to be working on my portfolio of the second term 

Recording: (5762/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5763/ 10721) 
yeah i i i loved one sixty one i loved it around there i loved all those core restaurants and everything 

Recording: (5764/ 10721) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children in our off spring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5765/ 10721) 
anyway and um i am not saying in general but with the experiences that i have had um certain families where they do not uh socioeconomic just not as well off yeah 

Recording: (5766/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5767/ 10721) 
until see what else happens i mean from what i know the story was kind of happy and many ways a children story but what has to happen within the a larger story between now and and you know the end of episode three is like the republic falls and the umire takes over and all the july are killed by this cute little eight year old kid 

Recording: (5768/ 10721) 
i like seeing them grow up together and 

Recording: (5769/ 10721) 
oh yeah i uh i think she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and stuff where she was growing up uh you know mine uh my values and uh basically are a more religious oriented you know uh than i would say my wife is but uh uh so i think she she knows what i value is being important well value is being not important and but on it the rest of 

Recording: (5770/ 10721) 
and uh oh they they  they saw the the ragged end of the war 

Recording: (5771/ 10721) 
oh understanding 

Recording: (5772/ 10721) 
my boyfriend would love to mess with us i just want you to he would be like he he taking it apart putting it back together 

Recording: (5773/ 10721) 
is the hard drive the cd wrong the three and a half the hundred twenty eight meg ram chip and the cpa it is the only thing that is factory anymore no they probably would not i do not know i do not know i am a real good 

Recording: (5774/ 10721) 
yeah are they going to change that 

Recording: (5775/ 10721) 
but it fixed it 

Recording: (5776/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5777/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5778/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5779/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5780/ 10721) 
and i was thirty nine 

Recording: (5781/ 10721) 
yeah she did that yesterday 

Recording: (5782/ 10721) 
well he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hope that it would drop and i mean when what you are hearing and read lately is that it really has not changed much uh and it but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready at some level to accept but engaged in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gee married so 

Recording: (5783/ 10721) 
yeah the lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw in her mouth and it could not breathe and breathed in all the sand and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows as how native american spiritual all just should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh which when all you religion is out there and native americans are the only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantum 

Recording: (5784/ 10721) 
i mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5785/ 10721) 
that should not be on the other hand i hate to see a thirteen year old have a baby because she was afraid yeah well 

Recording: (5786/ 10721) 
people would knock on the door and they would yell yeah that they were not home or something and 

Recording: (5787/ 10721) 
and uh i just told them what it has to do with my belief system say you are in violation of the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me you know so i just decided to since they were not going to change those i was just going to leave you know but so it is you know it is it is a hard way to choose to walk uh if you are an idealistic person it is i mean just more so 

Recording: (5788/ 10721) 
honeyd is probably be to pass james sunburnis the nba and unic uh there is probably some more on there but that is the one that jumped off there is like a a little hit list in my head obviously and another hit list in my phone payment and life is good 

Recording: (5789/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (5790/ 10721) 
yes and no i mean we have high schoolers in there um it there is no requirements as far as what school you go to um but we get our internet service is partially through ohio state and the last majority of college students go here 

Recording: (5791/ 10721) 
i would like to seen it passed just for the fact to see what the hell they would have done with the money but uh i do not blame people for voting for the one and not vote for the other because you are talking about something twenty i had an engineering a civil engineering friend years ago and uh i was at worthodontian chemical which is over in double and i lived over where i am living now and three a year they were doing work on two seventy uh so i get this off them and be be bitching at them about it and everything you know and they go you know realize you know by the time we get 

Recording: (5792/ 10721)

Recording: (5796/ 10721) 
so am i  um i missed your question before that 

Recording: (5797/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (5798/ 10721) 
a baby um a bible baby which worked out was just a sweet kid in the whole world and um and my daughter was from collin is a teacher and she watched see for a good three years during the day i mean i will call and pay her obviously but i mean and she really she really enjoyed that you know something that she could do at home you know she wanted to go out and run errand she could take with our 

Recording: (5799/ 10721) 
uh but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from the nonfamily we are headed toward or i have been hit a door and get back to a very basic family orientation it it is abhorite when i hear that that uh uh what was it seven ladies who were quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell their uh spring 

Recording: (5800/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5801/ 10721)

Recording: (5833/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5834/ 10721) 
well they did not say loud enough that you have the right to why we have never told the husband the right you know i never was told like i make the telephone call and if they can convince them and i think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything that is said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and then yet the they have got that thing allowed it is illegal civil rights you can not tape what i am saying it is like if we signed a paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are 

Recording: (5835/ 10721) 
umhum

Recording: (5850/ 10721) 
really you know i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out they would vote for none of the above and then we could have some more candidates 

Recording: (5851/ 10721) 
and that is what i like to 

Recording: (5852/ 10721)

two dollars an hour  so 

Recording: (5860/ 10721) 
well this is about given opinions and my opinion about the columbus public school system really is not good 

Recording: (5861/ 10721) 
um growing up my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs and so i was always interested in the food industry but more so planting of the parties and deciding you know what the clients needs are and uh i really like working in that aspect with you know nice shops and really creative food and um and it is nice because every basically every job is usually different um i am doing a function tonight for three hundred people 

Recording: (5862/ 10721) 
course the mandatory says you are right or wrong answer and 

Recording: (5863/ 10721) 
um there were people i met through friends um actually been one of my friends parents had a friend that was gay um just be over there or whatever i mean i can not say any big difference between 

Recording: (5864/ 10721) 
 right 

Recording: (5865/ 10721) 
but what what does it tell us about our people we are so naive we have got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that can be more beneficial and most of the time it is listening 

Recording: (5866/ 10721) 
yeah it is just what i can not understand is some people living up in arlington and some they get to private school 

Recording: (5867/ 10721) 
i had psychology class i would want that comes for anything  so i know a little bit about you know like you know studies 

Recording: (5868/ 10721) 
caren could see a weapon they are going to slap him on the arm 

Recording: (5869/ 10721) 
something to think about 

Recording: (5870/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5871/ 10721) 
and that was like around christmas time and i ran into him like webberware or something like that and ever since february is has been on a bench student drunk every day 

Recording: (5872/ 10721) 
mass communication to everybody with interpersonal communications that is the key my opinion personal versus interpersonal community and and and it is zero over here and we are almost a hundred percent over here but when we are in this interpersonal or global or massive whatever term is the most uh john doe who speaks here he has the faintest idea who jane doe is over here 

Recording: (5873/ 10721) 
it is gotten to the point where there is there is more than five million outside 

Recording: (5874/ 10721) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world there is nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think you know i mean i mean yeah there should not be there should not um should not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing 

Recording: (5875/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5876/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5877/ 10721) 
uh i do not have problems being around gays um i never have my you know my brotherinlaw his game my son is godfather is gay it is not a problem um 

Recording: (5878/ 10721) 
even if they do not pay me it is going to be fun 

Recording: (5879/ 10721) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (5880/ 10721) 
i do not know i think it is kind of deal with it when it gets here though 

Recording: (5881/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (5882/ 10721) 
i am living over on iowa uh if you on the other side of high street you know mcdonald is right by high street it is like 

Recording: (5883/ 10721) 
it ai not that far it is uh 

Recording: (5884/ 10721) 
little girl i i always think you should name a kid i have opinions about everything see i think you should name a kid something that will fit him at eighty three an eight and in between like we named our son robert so when he was little he was robby now he is eighteen he is robb when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do i mean robert paul you know and in kindergarten all i had learned to write was r o b or r o b b y 

Recording: (5885/ 10721) 
um we have not was we know it is one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here 

Recording: (5886/ 10721) 
so there is definitely work out available if you want to you know pursue it umhum wow did you all did you visit spainway to there because that is one of the places i wanna 

Recording: (5887/ 10721) 
and that was two two well back when i was a kid they had barrels of the bands at the mall 

Recording: (5888/ 10721) 
so me i i do not like i said i do not try and dwell on the negative you know but uh it is very easy they get sucked into what is wrong out there and it is also very easy to get sucked into the attitude well i am going to change this you know if you can you do what you can do who is the human being that alone is good enough 

Recording: (5889/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5890/ 10721) 
all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really it goes back to that what can we do to change it i think as i said it basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person than what is good for everybody not just me me me 

Recording: (5891/ 10721) 
i i i do not think it is necessarily that i think it comes back to the lack of selfdiscipline 

Recording: (5892/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5893/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (5894/ 10721) 
i mean it is like that is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said mcdonald is would not survive here if no one ate and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (5895/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5896/ 10721) 
fifty percent of everyone who married has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably uh once again we are talking about communications too and the communications can be ill and they can be great uh as she is touched 

Recording: (5897/ 10721) 
 little less romantic 

Recording: (5898/ 10721) 
he ended up dying he ended up dying from um what the does he age thank you from the age hours and swing around when he was near dying what did he tell his more mother i will not use exactly words because it was professional at the end and he said i really my life did not my mom and he is got three kids three growing on kids right now so you see what made him change what influence in society to do that i do not know how we find it but i think if more people i do not think it was ever taught in the bible to 

Recording: (5899/ 10721) 
 they there is this one that is like out in wisconsin or something that she said and it was really nice and she had been there like a couple of times and she says they should put one right there she said that will make up for it  

Recording: (5900/ 10721)

the uh or the yeah the government mayors the you know but then look at them i mean there is another example well yeah i mean  it is so that is not the that is not the case but it is all it is in a a man too you know i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we have had to live with them forever you know even g movies that little kids are going to see if there is a woman in there 

Recording: (5920/ 10721) 
we are going to do and if boy if they say that and they really make it so and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well then how could they say they they have got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalty stick

that is funny 

Recording: (5922/ 10721)

Recording: (5927/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5928/ 10721) 
no not really  oh i i feel a huge difference for me personally um just in the um clowness and being able to pick up on his shoes a lot better and just knowing his needs 

Recording: (5929/ 10721) 
you know worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if i would known that they were not going to vote at eighteen and were going to wait until they were almost forty i wonder i wonder waste my time uh but anyway um you you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age 

Recording: (5930/ 10721) 
yeah because my friend has some place where she even teaches young and has she is real involved in it that she goes to uh one i told you was a realtor but i should find out where that is too oh it is a five five dollar you know because i know she she goes to some place called copala and pennsylvania from time to time and who knows i just i do not really do it for the meditation or anything 

Recording: (5931/ 10721)

Recording: (5933/ 10721) 
yeah he is really good 

Recording: (5934/ 10721) 
yeah and i i just i guess i just felt like um looks it is kind of i mean i i think that that is kind of neat and if you are looking at traffic and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back the amount of money that you paid a park downtown is outrageous um even just having to take i know when it is when it was snowing because i worked on i worked on front street and where i would come for i live on buffalo road which is i take basketball to three fifteen down 

Recording: (5935/ 10721) 
and i was trying to do everything and then also too they wanted me to go to therapy 

Recording: (5936/ 10721) 
oh i see but i do not i guess from a career perspective they say it is not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but 

Recording: (5937/ 10721) 
i i used to kind of worry about the effect that tv had on me um i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv i would come home from school and plot myself in front of the tv and watch uh like you know four cartoons back to back or so every day after school or i that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be a a block of you know from six in the morning until afternoon or something these days i do not watch nearly that 

Recording: (5938/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5939/ 10721) 
yeah from the track yeah um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so did make you feel as needed as you wanted to do anything you know yeah uh you know we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike and i think the bosses knew this was coming so a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then 

Recording: (5940/ 10721) 
um which i am so happy for because she did not she stayed a little bit more with her kids but she never did again like yeah she she just by herself for like years and years she is fifty now 

Recording: (5941/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5942/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5943/ 10721) 
more cosmopolitan 

Recording: (5944/ 10721) 
well it is harder than i think in in some ways than people think um i went to the teach ohio fair last year to look around and did not see that much interest in in uh chemistry or general science teachers um i think the market is is fluctuated back to a point where they do not need as many right now  they are not clamering for 

Recording: (5945/ 10721) 
yeah one is a alternative school and the other one is just a regular trashy public school  

Recording: (5946/ 10721) 
teachers and so the questions could change 

Recording: (5947/ 10721) 
yeah they are you know you get kind of on a personal basis with them and take a couple days off and you come in and you say what happened to all she passed away on the i told her i was bringing her a pack of cigarettes you know the you know so i mean uh yeah you get kind of a test to to them and everything and or then they get sick sick you know and they move them up to a i used to 

Recording: (5948/ 10721) 
period because they are from um a different they are from the virgin islands 

Recording: (5949/ 10721) 
i would say see in mine i do not think they really were because i can not really say for anybody else is uh but but we were we had tended we had intended i am having a uh we get divorced in eighty eight and we had not tended but then the next couple three years of having joint because today but then our divorce was somewhat better or it became even more better and everything you know uh so that tended not to um 

Recording: (5950/ 10721) 
do not waste like thirty dollars on like conservative coins or something and they are like i do not even know what they are doing or too like when it is really apparent that people should not be i am putting this on their credit card when it is like you put it in one credit card and it does not go through because it is max age and i am like no do not do that like well you can not do that or you get in trouble or whatever and it is just it is funny how you know it is real weird at at our office that um uh is it the first place that i have been to where like you clock in you know 

Recording: (5951/ 10721) 
uh i was good in the interview i knew what i was doing i kind of wished i had not been as prepared but uh but it was a lot of the i moved into a management position i was in it was a natural move it was not even a pay raise or anything it was a natural move and the people that i was supervisor some of them have been doing it for twenty years and they made it very clear to me that they knew the program and i did not 

Recording: (5952/ 10721) 
the  

Recording: (5953/ 10721) 
women really do not need to wait long but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (5954/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5955/ 10721) 
i know it 

Recording: (5956/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5957/ 10721) 
and then they get around all these girls and i am like oh my gosh well you know you got to look at that you got to be more aware 

Recording: (5958/ 10721) 
my daughter is a school teacher she is been teaching or i do not know ever since she got her degree 

Recording: (5959/ 10721) 
we used it as a word earlier in your statement what we should buy 

Recording: (5960/ 10721) 
i like him personally and when he was running for a mayor i would have voted for him i met him and everything but i guess he just as plays the devil is advocate all the time at the uh uh the uh school board meetings i heard this is just a room you want not gossip in here 

Recording: (5961/ 10721) 
we feel we are better off leaving them there 

Recording: (5962/ 10721) 
yeah not me it is too expensive 

Recording: (5963/ 10721) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yeah the special kid who has no area that he does not excel in like once i had a sixth grade girl who stole the nor time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of metals and gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away 

Recording: (5964/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (5965/ 10721) 
i am sure yeah i mean uh she he does not throw women there facing the women call the house or anything uh you never know what she does not you know question him about where he is been or anything like that and i she just i just can not believe that i just think that is terrible 

Recording: (5966/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5967/ 10721) 
definitely and it really makes you aware of your mentality i mean things you see everyday i mean you never know i could happen to anybody anytime just like that accident yesterday with um right 

Recording: (5968/ 10721) 
it was nice actually i ate a lot more healthy and um it was cheaper i was getting money in my buck i would eat so i actually got everyday 

Recording: (5969/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5970/ 10721) 
that is funny 

Recording: (5971/ 10721) 
oh we have fun  

Recording: (5972/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5973/ 10721) 
yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration and you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (5974/ 10721) 
you know so i think maybe not universal health care but for children i think it would be helpful 

Recording: (5975/ 10721) 
because we wanted to be because it is a privilege not because oh i got to go to another play you know my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theater and i sure that eighteen performances because i could be free i did not i did not want to pay ten bucks every time to see it but if i usured i could be in the audience every time you know and for my there is to have no interest in seeing seeing play baseball or swam some fry away and you know or not play they they would not they do not even want to be 

Recording: (5976/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5977/ 10721) 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (5978/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (5979/ 10721) 
so i do not know whether they did any damage or not but 

Recording: (5980/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5981/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (5982/ 10721) 
well a quarterback is got a injury to his hand i mean he still does good he just he needs to focus in on who he is throwing at instead of throwing a fifty mile i was down the road  he is done that a couple of times yesterday and uh watching out who he is thrown to you know yeah might help too 

Recording: (5983/ 10721) 
you know so it is you know if you if you have a problem if you want to talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (5984/ 10721) 
but most of the time it is not it is not bad um so there is there is that it is a opportunity for the musitions in the college to play an orchestra and well what else did they get out of it i do not know prestige i suppose   yeah 

Recording: (5985/ 10721) 
and as a result like they are kids my age and stuff like that that i talked to i mean they have no idea what is going on 

Recording: (5986/ 10721) 
yeah those are nice 

Recording: (5987/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5988/ 10721) 
downtown abandoned warehouses to get rented out for a night 

Recording: (5989/ 10721) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (5990/ 10721) 
and you know as with a lot of the resentment that is felt that i experienced toward americans you know rather saddly i think our culture is starting to really abuse itself into the europe at least i mean i see instead of us becoming more like them you know them becoming more like us walmart has bought you know a big uh retailer there so 

Recording: (5991/ 10721) 
i do not nobody is worth that you know so that is what i am saying it is so retarded uh with a i do not mean to use that word in a bad way but it is ridiculous uh but then i mean that is a better word uh that that people have to are uh have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can not afford the legal help so i think that is wrong in this country the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right 

Recording: (5992/ 10721) 
 sometimes people just go on and on about things like i i got a uh like they have like some like insane problem like i do not know why they are sharing it with me like you know like i i had to get this you know i had to get this chair because my brotherinlaw yeah he sat on it and broke it man i got to fight with him about that yeah his wife involved of all i can say i do not know what the east is or something i do not know i do not know what the east is or anything like that 

Recording: (5993/ 10721)

Recording: (5994/ 10721) 
they are about two hours west of omaha so it is different for them 

Recording: (5995/ 10721)

Recording: (5996/ 10721) 
right right uhhuh i studied there i studied music and chemistry and and ended up with a double major bachelor is degree there not doing really the same time 

Recording: (5997/ 10721) 
i know another thing about the kids nowadays is it is uh i have not experienced it with her you know it is uh i sent her a hundred dollars one time you know just for her and she said turns i called her up a couple of days later or about a week a week later something like that and uh said what would you do with that uh what would you get with that money and everything she said well you know i bought a gap tshirt and i uh cd i said umhum she goes uh what do you mean uhhuh that is what i bought i said you bought a cd and a blouse 

Recording: (5998/ 10721)

Recording: (5999/ 10721) 
i dress all right i guess in a couple of weeks i will have it done 

Recording: (6000/ 10721) 
i like it a lot um i uh it is it is changed a lot since i have been here you know i mean it is really come a long way in terms of of the amenities of civilization you know restaurants and and and museums and we get all the good movies now in the backseat centers but a big boost and so there is you know it is a whole different for a time than it was when i first came here but it is still relatively cheap and it is easy to get around and uh it is got a lot going for 

Recording: (6001/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6002/ 10721) 
think that that with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing i think people are starting to look at it a little differently 

Recording: (6003/ 10721) 
and it makes you a a better person because you get the spiritual and so you are driving you and that is what is going to take you home i often ask if people uh you ask me about marketing 

Recording: (6004/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (6005/ 10721) 
but she was never interested in never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or makeup clothes and things like that you you know you are saying for ridiculous when high school for that and that is what happens she would come home and tear because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going in within a couple months she a hundred gd 

Recording: (6006/ 10721) 
umhum i have always been into art in high school i went to uh art like uh balt and and that was for fine arts and i always wanted to do art because i can not do anything else no no it is most see i am i am not good at math or i mean i could probably major in english or something like that but not math  oh 

Recording: (6007/ 10721) 
that is where we need to correct 

Recording: (6008/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6009/ 10721) 
yeah  i know we talk too long but this is so much fun 

Recording: (6010/ 10721) 
oh not in the immediate family going back like you did there i know there there is a murder area in our family uh oh there have been horse thieves so i am going on back now i am not thinking in terms of the current family but basically what i was told my wife go is current families somewhat current 

Recording: (6011/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6012/ 10721) 
it is all document 

Recording: (6013/ 10721) 
or you are just going to go back because you do not know any other way at the time 

Recording: (6014/ 10721) 
yes they have a deal on monday just i think like after five p m 

Recording: (6015/ 10721) 
and a lot of times unions uh they actually actually seem detrimental like to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because the if a year becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy uh lazy union as a representative of of these workers so they are more apt to go outside 

Recording: (6016/ 10721) 
but she was great i mean we did not i did not think that then i do not know why but she was very manly but she was very she was very good but she was you know just not feminine at all 

Recording: (6017/ 10721) 
right well let me ask you uh that somebody else who is not that well known do you know john gorica have you heard of him he is really worth looking in too he is he is funny he has good songs he is a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arnold guthier or somebody i mean he he does electric uh sometimes but he also does a acoustic and uh he writes most of his own songs yeah and that if you ever see something by him you should get it 

Recording: (6018/ 10721) 
 you can not 

Recording: (6019/ 10721) 
well we use 

Recording: (6020/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6021/ 10721) 
and then why out working and making incomes as everyone in the united states today feels they must uh haze or had hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i my judgment is that we are spending today probably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they 

Recording: (6022/ 10721) 
went to worthington high school and in the end of my third year it became worthy to killmore high school and thomas worthyton high school 

Recording: (6023/ 10721) 
i think that uh it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (6024/ 10721) 
and why do i think that is um 

Recording: (6025/ 10721) 
enough to satisfy me so that was good 

Recording: (6026/ 10721) 
i was in seventy eight um and then i have just i have stayed there and it is grown a lot in the work humum it is an interesting place to work because uh well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening or trying to stay out in front of what in front of what library innovation in front of web and that innovation and trying to incorporate it all so it is it you know it is 

Recording: (6027/ 10721) 
yeah um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time i just went and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i did not go like under their insurance or on the same it is been 

Recording: (6028/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6029/ 10721) 
the government  whoever wants to be  

Recording: (6030/ 10721) 
the age of ten 

Recording: (6031/ 10721) 
uh she is in my class 

Recording: (6032/ 10721) 
so uh anyway we we had a fine field day that one day i fired at them the next morning about ten oclock we heard one i heard a shell coming in and it was on the air force back of us about five hundred yards 

Recording: (6033/ 10721) 
i did not not like boston i just do not um i think it is it is kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (6034/ 10721) 
if they are especially if they are over forty because they are companies giving money back to the community for this and that and you know that is how they are trying to show that they care about this they are trying to mentour some school or some group of kids or give money for the down trodden or you know but you are right i think it is terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do better science skills than we do better language skills than we do 

Recording: (6035/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (6036/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6037/ 10721) 
so you are not a kid 

Recording: (6038/ 10721) 
or i got a drive you know further north so there is not any like really good businesses right around where i love that is the only thing so i think they need to come in you know read it you know get the downtown going when i was a kid i would love to go downtown 

Recording: (6039/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6040/ 10721) 
yeah well like i i played music and stuff with a lot of my friends i do not know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around watching tv and like uh but like um in high school though i was just real like like you know you put in like a tiny little bit of effort and you get like a b and that is and that is good enough i guess 

Recording: (6041/ 10721) 
by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge to protect people to protect ideals to protect principals throw it out the winter for money and then when it comes down to me being legitimate hurt um it got down to just a dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth and it is the bidding started a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar i feel i am worth more than that you know 

Recording: (6042/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (6043/ 10721) 
and uh we met i was working at a restaurant in short north and they were having a christmas party and his brother worked there and he brought my husband and i went there and that is how we met  umhum 

Recording: (6044/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6045/ 10721) 
yeah drugs right yeah yeah see that is what she is interested in right now she is looking to see if she can find someplace to work this summer even if it is just a day a week or some clinic or something just to to see what is goes on day to day 

Recording: (6046/ 10721) 
i mean if we were that racist of a city then we would not be that accepting to gay pride marches and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back byebye 

Recording: (6047/ 10721) 
so the way the university here around i can not agree with most of the stuff they did 

Recording: (6048/ 10721) 
um college wise i do not know anyone of college age that is got 

Recording: (6049/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i have i have back problems or anything like that but it was just like the feeling it was like i am not right 

Recording: (6050/ 10721) 
under the conditions that had to prevail i was treated well enough 

Recording: (6051/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6052/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6053/ 10721) 
i am the one that is eventually going to get in trouble 

Recording: (6054/ 10721) 
we just started reselling 

Recording: (6055/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6056/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6057/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6058/ 10721) 
yeah that and i think i i am a firm believer that uh little subtleies like that to yourself are much better than looking the mirror and going look at them whoops and you go well this way when you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to your would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (6059/ 10721) 
well we believe that um that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again in through joseph smith because he had a desire and it is hard to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god and jesus christ and i know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctor and stuff but and um and he was told that there were no none of the churches on the earth were 

Recording: (6060/ 10721) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (6061/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6062/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6063/ 10721) 
not really i mean yeah there is some little flaws but 

Recording: (6064/ 10721) 
i do not know uh and i do not and for a while we got it stopped the thing that is uh confusing to me is that sometimes will get something stopped for twenty five or thirty years or ten or fifteen and then we go back it is like hey we got moved ourselves out of that where we going back to it now uh and and i think you know that papers keep saying that our uh crime rate is going down and 

Recording: (6065/ 10721) 
so he did he went out there and threw some gasoline on it not knowing that one of the other kp is had been there humum him and thrown gasoline on it so there was i do not know much gasoline only when he threw a match on it 

Recording: (6066/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6067/ 10721) 
well not not really much of the um answering the phones and stuff it was more of the um my um employer my employees that i worked with it it was just so pretty much i worked with uh adult sac like we were in high school and it was a groupy you know and i am not like that i tried along with everybody and and and it was just i never ended up sitting in with everybody and just things were gosh i have been i do not go for that and i ended up quitting a job and i felt like 

Recording: (6068/ 10721) 
oh okay i thought well what you mean because like some 

Recording: (6069/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (6070/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (6071/ 10721) 
well it is not just in the schools it is in society um environment seems to be an answer to a lot of things and i it is i i just can not it is hard to imagine that that there is an easy fix or there is a fix i am kind of frustrating because you can not point to one say this is what needs to be fixed again it is pervasive uh it is like the well if you heard about this in the news a woman too women are having an argument 

Recording: (6072/ 10721) 
not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so inclined to like push their athletes to cut weight 

Recording: (6073/ 10721) 
that movie was good makes you think like right now i am cold and when you see it you will know what i am talking about like coldness 

Recording: (6074/ 10721) 
it is a couple miles 

Recording: (6075/ 10721) 
oh no and it turns out it was the the uh the faceless alien set a trap for the for the guys and i did not like the it was resolved but i like the fact that it was not resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha uh 

Recording: (6076/ 10721) 
i think their coach is the best joke r uh is the best 

Recording: (6077/ 10721) 
said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was a word i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a best of you are with 

Recording: (6078/ 10721) 
yeah it is just ridiculous the amounts of stuff and i am like i do not know what to do 

Recording: (6079/ 10721) 
right and just going over it and over it and over it 

Recording: (6080/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6081/ 10721) 
it is like each neighborhood is got a little different personality 

Recording: (6082/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6083/ 10721) 
we want to clean or anything they would probably say you know they might think it was kind of weird but they would let you you know but they would be like you want to do this and we do not have any money to pay you oh but we do not you know we do not want money that is the whole point where 

Recording: (6084/ 10721) 
my wife was a uh very conscientious hard working woman she established a secretary business there or a home for several years and uh anything that went out of there was right and uh she did uh quite a lot of camping for students over here graduate students 

Recording: (6085/ 10721) 
oh that was the monica lewis 

Recording: (6086/ 10721) 
yeah yeah she is been known to do that too yep  

Recording: (6087/ 10721) 
no that is 

Recording: (6088/ 10721) 
that is they are doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easier 

Recording: (6089/ 10721) 
it is an example and in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took jump between algebra you would think you know i push these straight a is in algebrabird when i got to jump during i thought why am i taking this so that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are reteaching it entirely different now and i think linda explained to how they were doing it with matthews that she could not even help him and you know it is in the same way of politics it is people 

Recording: (6090/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6091/ 10721) 
and substitute from a whatever and then you would tell them and then you know on the same turn they would just sort of like snicker and be like oh you are not whatever of this european thing you are you know sort of 

Recording: (6092/ 10721) 
and uh where my mom was a a young high school student  just graduating from high school and so they got together there moved to california  

Recording: (6093/ 10721) 
he is got this thing like uh thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all 

Recording: (6094/ 10721) 
oh you get your choice  let us 

Recording: (6095/ 10721) 
yeah that could really bite you in the back though when in all that money i would be well i would be quite content with one million dollars but ten huh i mean do you think anybody in this town has ten million dollars well maybe a couple of people yeah 

Recording: (6096/ 10721) 
yeah when i first went to oakland i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i would maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and uh although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh 

Recording: (6097/ 10721) 
so we are kind of doing that and i figure i am probably going to wait tables at night  and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (6098/ 10721) 
because that is like me i watch three students and you do not see me putting a crew bar up nobody is nose 

Recording: (6099/ 10721) 
no i i um have very little contact with them and so that would be about the last thing i would be doing okay where are we 

Recording: (6100/ 10721) 
yeah i like uh keyboard and like this phone and you put on a head set and stuff and uh okay i mean people call in and um 

Recording: (6101/ 10721) 
um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see over there that prevents it you know they are a sort of middle of the line dress that would be like at the limited here something is you know seventy five pounds you know at like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them and limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but you know really if you buy that 

Recording: (6102/ 10721) 
no  

Recording: (6103/ 10721) 
yeah we have that many animals you know people 

Recording: (6104/ 10721) 
 so and he 

Recording: (6105/ 10721) 
yeah and they they need it right 

Recording: (6106/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6107/ 10721) 
she does not know that i do not go to church 

Recording: (6108/ 10721) 
almost the minority it was a pretty even it is a very it is a low income neighborhood and when i was in seventh grade i remember going home and saying with everybody the same and being told well of course they are so i was at school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black and i got called into the office and they called me a social worker and they my was punished i was not allowed to uh i was grounded for the year and they never called this kid and i i then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up you know what what is wrong with these people they kept saying 

Recording: (6109/ 10721) 
throwed it 

Recording: (6110/ 10721) 
oh yeah fine now it comes back to your statement what do they tell us we need well no we you need the refrigerator you need frost free you need all these things you know what you go down the street and see how many garage sales you have and then the ask people why would you buy them oh we thought we needed them 

Recording: (6111/ 10721) 
yeah yeah ever authority figures it all you know she is she is really strong about that though because um she does not look at anybody being uh you know maybe more wise or experienced in things but you know certainly she does not trust anybody 

Recording: (6112/ 10721) 
not 

Recording: (6113/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6114/ 10721) 
umhum ten thousand dollar fine  oh man talk about cutting a coupon there rain 

Recording: (6115/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6116/ 10721) 
that is all right okay 

Recording: (6117/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (6118/ 10721) 
right with the human rights 

Recording: (6119/ 10721) 
um no some of them play game stores but i have done it once and said it was not that good 

Recording: (6120/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6121/ 10721) 
i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have a i feel that i have a distinct uh uh a very clear distinction between what is uh in what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (6122/ 10721) 
yes i um uh lordy um grew up on the west side i went my husband went um approximately wise was probably within a mile of each other they are weird kind of high schools we hurts and the whole bit um his dad still lives in griff city my mom lives still at our our family house they are on the west side and we moved um also on the west side probably a couple of miles from my mom 

Recording: (6123/ 10721) 
um hum they like me but then they do not like me 

Recording: (6124/ 10721) 
twenty eight years this is my twenty eighth year i have two more years to go and i get the retired and then i will go retrain and umhum 

Recording: (6125/ 10721) 
caring parent you know maybe not even one of the parents you know they might have a foster family or you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there is a lot of the people that that are if there is families who do not really want the money you know and and there is all that so it is it is really scary and i think i think that it has something has to be done real fast i do not know i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh 

Recording: (6126/ 10721) 
people and that is very hard to negotiate for anybody you know when you are talking raises and lots of money like this is what they were going for and the majority of the people in this still trades are not real big participants in the union you know we just ride along and from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here is it seems that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the troubled maker employees around longer you know and 

Recording: (6127/ 10721) 
let us 

Recording: (6128/ 10721) 
that is great 

Recording: (6129/ 10721) 
because i mean i have got a lot i love this man to death it is like and that might be something that was is holding back from dating but you know it will eventually go away he will  but um yeah i would want her i do not care uh if he is he looks like the perfect guy because yeah i think he looks like he is a very his guy and you know he just does not know how to stick with one woman i do not think yeah 

Recording: (6130/ 10721)

Recording: (6230/ 10721) 
i like i know one of the poisons using it is like rap poison or something like that i mean just obviously the idea of putting rap poison into you when it is meant to kill a rat obviously seems be dangerous 

Recording: (6231/ 10721)

Recording: (6238/ 10721) 
i think it is important to know what the person is values and cousins are and to support whatever it is and if i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed to face the north star or they needed to have this thing above the bed or under the bed and i mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (6239/ 10721) 
i i have heard it it has not been as i have heard it from less reputable sources 

Recording: (6240/ 10721)

Recording: (6241/ 10721) 
 really i do not know i mean i guess for me i i just i just amazed when i get along so well you know and and we have been together for about two years and i mean i i do not know i just i do i just i just really like them i do not  in ten years from now but it certainly there is a lot of things that that our family is very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about different things and and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot 

Recording: (6242/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6243/ 10721) 
people graduate get degrees from the high state working here taking one course a one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them to ten years or something you know but it is like why not it is 

Recording: (6244/ 10721)

Recording: (6273/ 10721) 
i think 

Recording: (6274/ 10721)

Recording: (6275/ 10721) 
uh you are little clicks clicks it is like being back in high school 

Recording: (6276/ 10721) 
oh boy that is that that kind of like speaks poorly about us huh 

Recording: (6277/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6278/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6279/ 10721) 
just over summer and i used the apath and then i drove my dad down on far enough

i 

Recording: (6283/ 10721) 
we were in real estate and uh comes with that

umhum 

Recording: (6285/ 10721) 
yeah i know that would be neat i would love to do that 

Recording: (6286/ 10721) 
very big differences stuck together on a small ship they just glossed over those and it became just like the next generation except for the they did not talk to the federation as much anymore so i did not like that but 

Recording: (6287/ 10721) 
and then when you do not take it easy 

Recording: (6288/ 10721) 
where it is where it is not such it is not weird it is just a family 

Recording: (6289/ 10721) 
so i made a last year but you know you look back and you see things you are like this is real obvious but at the time i think you have i was like uh hey i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and you know that type of thing 

Recording: (6290/ 10721) 
i was just listening to music and i got a little side tracked from this uh tree across the way got destroyed by lightning i looked across and it started raining and wind was a little heavy rocking me back and forth like this i got up all the way looked around and i said what the hell is going on here turn on the yeah and they said some uh you know thunderstorm coming through and it will be gone by twenty minutes or something and this 

Recording: (6291/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (6292/ 10721) 
that is one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was we were shopping for school systems just as much you know so and i do not want to buy a house and i do not want to to move when my kids get older to move into a better school since uh because it seems like since we have bought our house the houses are just doubling and tripling and value believe yeah oh i do not know ours has increased quite a lot since we have been there but we have been there i guess about ten years 

Recording: (6293/ 10721) 
i have been in the same house for seventeen years 

Recording: (6294/ 10721)

Recording: (6297/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6298/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6299/ 10721) 
because they are they have enough money to buy new things and they do not want to necessarily send it down i do not think to the salvation army or the i i do not know but i think that they think that there is a better way of giving away and like good will they resell and salvation army they resell well we we 

Recording: (6300/ 10721)

see there again the business out box the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another try to understand your neighbor more and spend time getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangible depreciate and they will depreciate see and it will be nothing and your investments gone 

Recording: (6345/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6346/ 10721) 
i am very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it is because mom was home and you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it does not have to be mom i mean um you know mom can go work and dad can stay home and there is nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad there everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they have had a really bad day and so that they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it is like how how school 

Recording: (6347/ 10721) 
yeah one is still in high school and she she is ready to she was to go on to college so she is pretty much ready to go i mean she did she is got one more year high school but uh and i held her back in kindergarten so she is uh an older graduate she will be nineteen when she graduates and then on the other hand graduated when she seventeen so um then my youngest daughter amy she is uh she is doing real well i mean she is getting really good grades 

Recording: (6348/ 10721)

uh that would be the closest small to me is northland it is convenient for me 

Recording: (6351/ 10721) 
but i mean i honestly do think i would at least go to church on occasion if it was not forced on me i mean it just got sort of just to the point of being ridiculous going seventeen eighteen years every single week

Recording: (6356/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6357/ 10721) 
actually they are they are working on it i am sorry did not mean to i am trying to um they have they have um just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty level i think is considered um thirteen thousand pounds a year um and if if you are below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yeah so there is a bonus for back to 

Recording: (6358/ 10721) 
oh yes 

Recording: (6359/ 10721) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6360/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (6361/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6362/ 10721) 
there was snow or something 

Recording: (6363/ 10721) 
i did not even get a computer because i was so afraid of what they could be able to access there was nothing you know there was nothing barred at all when they first came out yeah and you know we are all those software people they are not responsible for ytk they are not responsible for you know all this internet access to all this stuff so it is really hard 

Recording: (6364/ 10721) 
oh no no they move you around all the time when you when you teach kids with learning disabilities they move you to where the population is rather than move the kids to you so yeah i have been in columbus and worthing to know the two systems i have been in but you know the in those systems they can move you around from school to school i mean it is the same one now for this is my seventh year at the middle school

center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it is easier to get that sold to the american public um so uh while i think dole was correct um i think she uh she shot herself in the foot i do not you would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controlled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they move they need to move towards the middle 

Recording: (6369/ 10721) 
and now now to 

Recording: (6370/ 10721) 
which is  well yeah you know could have done that too  

Recording: (6371/ 10721) 
to find out they do not want to take the baby home because they are afraid of being too attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly her mother is like um they 

Recording: (6372/ 10721) 
to tell you the score went too such i mean 

Recording: (6373/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6374/ 10721) 
here in columbus yeah i have i have always lived in columbus yeah 

Recording: (6375/ 10721) 
uh yeah they uh got me one time for cut zero period and the principal is with having me sit in the office during zero period to serve the attention uh if you could tell me how they can get me for cutting the class when they ordered me to sit in the principal is office i could figure that one out too 

Recording: (6376/ 10721) 
yeah i do not understand it i really have a hard time understanding you know they are not after you they just want to live a life 

Recording: (6377/ 10721) 
a lot of them they do not want any better they will not want anything different that is all they want 

Recording: (6378/ 10721)

Recording: (6381/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6382/ 10721) 
i i do 

Recording: (6383/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6384/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6385/ 10721)

Recording: (6388/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6389/ 10721) 
yeah i do not know why uh columbus has just stubborn about it until the last year uh they had not been able to get subs fifty substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well i do not know if the parents made anything about it but i guess finally you know when you have fifty percent of your classrooms covered uh they came to it and they 

Recording: (6390/ 10721) 
of the guns on them and went back and wondered now  they are going to put us in infantry or something we do not have any or tiller guns but uh i do not know it was not but a couple or three days they had more guns i mean more artichoke pieces up there for us to use and then well another time after in italy or when we were in italy we they moved us into a position that

i could do all kinds of stuff you know 

Recording: (6395/ 10721) 
something in his schedule interfere with it 

Recording: (6396/ 10721) 
is easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can you have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment um unfortunately i think that is the problem parents um are a they are getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start putting the kids against 

Recording: (6397/ 10721) 
uh i live up north uh around carl and uh more so 

Recording: (6398/ 10721) 
at this point i i am stopped for a moment and i am just like so nobody can think their divorce was so important that i need to sit down to deal with it because i i obviously i i i have a curiosity that some i think a whack is a is a foot and so okay i sit down is that your your father killed himself this morning and oh and then there is like a sort of a white out period there so you do not get like decent details on on what occurred i do not actually think anything exciting occurred 

Recording: (6399/ 10721) 
huhuh 

Recording: (6400/ 10721) 
you know because they will be grown up and a blink of an eye so if i i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold it is going to be worth it in the long run when my kids are grown up and they can be like yeah mom was there they taught you know mom and dad taught us you know all of our the life application skills that we need to know now and i think that that will be better in the long run for them and that is the 

Recording: (6401/ 10721) 
to let her out and that is kind of like i mean of course kids you can not put in the yard 

Recording: (6402/ 10721)

Recording: (6403/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6404/ 10721) 
um i get a bs which they mail to me after first year of medical school like they figure that uh gross and that i mean all that is enough 

Recording: (6405/ 10721) 
actually in order to get in my room you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify high as a learning disability kid in other words the way you qualify in the state of ohio is those you have a thirty point discrimination between your actual iq and your daily performance in other words let us say you have a hundred iq but in all their classes your forming like a seventy iq person would so if there is a thirty point discrimination in there and and people see that you are bright and but yet you are just not 

Recording: (6406/ 10721) 
yeah i can i can imagine 

Recording: (6407/ 10721)

she was the rudeest woman 

Recording: (6416/ 10721)

stayed here so 

Recording: (6420/ 10721) 
diverisity 

Recording: (6421/ 10721) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spent on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in into doctor costs and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (6422/ 10721) 
umhum umhum yeah but that those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although our conductor tries hard to make it interesting for orchestra members by bringing in some music that is that is interesting challenging or whatever for orchestra he so we are lucky to have him he is who is a associate conductor for the uh columbus symphony 

Recording: (6423/ 10721) 
why can not they fake ours to make it easier for us to understand but you know but no usually there is no problem the only problem usually is like somebody like yourself who has never flown and is taking lessons and you you know you have about ten or fifteen hours and we tell you to do something and you like um well i think i know what the means all just keep flying and that that is the worst thing you can do the best thing you can do is say okay i heard what you said but i am brand new at this and i have got no idea what you mean can you try to get and they will go okay 

Recording: (6424/ 10721) 
i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but you know but it is i i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university yeah  yeah 

Recording: (6425/ 10721) 
yeah we are getting impatiens and we are getting um it is it is sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now all the will be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are we are really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say to my friends i say teach these kids well because they are going to be 

Recording: (6426/ 10721) 
but historically you know women were not you know it was a man is field and and you know even women who were doing it and doing it well did not get the attention did not get 

Recording: (6427/ 10721) 
no over on uh bill uh you know where that over by north broadway or i said 

Recording: (6428/ 10721) 
yeah but uh just to see the church might be fun um we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worsehip center building and because we were really too too big for the sanksuary that we had 

Recording: (6429/ 10721) 
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and 

Recording: (6430/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (6431/ 10721) 
umhum very driven the only problem she has she did not have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself but she chooses to be still at home and be part of our life and um my son he is both those kids have four points i mean they really were cardin school because they know it is important and my son was uh he was the only the only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the matureing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i am really 

Recording: (6432/ 10721) 
oh really uh it is like whoa milk and swisslers 

Recording: (6433/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6434/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6435/ 10721)

Recording: (6436/ 10721) 
right yeah that would be fun 

Recording: (6437/ 10721) 
someselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that i do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i thought as something that would be even grittinger they they had the potential for for excellent intercharacter conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season um and that really bothered me and it it ultimately this story like they are trapped 

Recording: (6438/ 10721) 
i know steve my husband sometimes i mean we have taken joey out to the military a few times to go to the grapevine of his mother and he says you know very often boy they she would really have liked to have been here and done things with

that is a rule coming down hand down 

Recording: (6441/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6442/ 10721) 
oh yeah it is so much better to have it in an alley or sit down on your deck and look in your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then in the gulf course uh so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside two seventies still so 

Recording: (6443/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6444/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (6445/ 10721)

Recording: (6449/ 10721) 
you know the access is just there is almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of yeah talking about oh yeah you know getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like you know what your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you 

Recording: (6450/ 10721)

as a top and it is it is not intentional it is just the way he is so he was able to circumvent anything that the psychologist was trying until he had finally admitted that yeah he had a problem and then things would much more smoothly and that they are still not really convinced of the diagnosis because there is multiple problems and they have not ruled out that some of the other things in he could he just knew how to get around anything

umhum 

Recording: (6555/ 10721)

Recording: (6556/ 10721) 
no my roommates are i just my mom wanted me too but i i the way it stands right now i just would rather work than money

Recording: (6561/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6562/ 10721) 
you know with while they totally erase the culture and all the stores and everything like that and the food uh you know the fast food or whatever they hate it at the same time because it is ruining you know and and and i had a lot of friends from elsewhere in you know western europe and uh you know they just were and i i was quite surprised actually because when i first went there uh i worked on an island previous i mean macint island you know which was just north of michigan but and i would met some english people there and it was you know there all the american

yes i have several times 

Recording: (6565/ 10721) 
than would be with the black president and i think it would cause problems um i do not know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see a definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (6566/ 10721) 
crime and stuff uh i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over uh but people have been better off financially overall um and i and i do not think he is made any i do not i would not say he is made his major mistakes policy wise well yes it his personal life  just in his 

Recording: (6567/ 10721) 
no i 

Recording: (6568/ 10721) 
well yeah under certain 

Recording: (6569/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6570/ 10721) 
probably not it is a fad they are going to move along and move out of it you know so 

Recording: (6571/ 10721) 
no kind of uh you know uh it it just seems like our a society just has that you have to be just horrible to a person because they are bad well you know i know that a bad person does not become better by being bad to them 

Recording: (6572/ 10721) 
yeah that is fun and that is a challenging age too thirteen months that is fun 

Recording: (6573/ 10721) 
oh you are just you are just a a homemaker  

Recording: (6574/ 10721)

Recording: (6576/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6577/ 10721) 
uh grade school and it is attached to columbus alternative high school so uh you know i i read a um a uh resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the the closest she got to crying at school was when she would uh do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy and it was just they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or two is worth of candy and hit it out and they would have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says you know those are the things that 

Recording: (6578/ 10721) 
and then uh my oldest son is wife is a secretary in the in the school 

Recording: (6579/ 10721) 
oh i am sure 

Recording: (6580/ 10721) 
you had done okay so it was it was like okay you know welcome to australia you know you know he is he is he is a textbook you know go to work 

Recording: (6581/ 10721) 
yeah well yeah and but you know i mean that that is that is civilization wide 

Recording: (6582/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6583/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6584/ 10721) 
i always have guns like that is the car to shoot somebody when i yeah when 

Recording: (6585/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6586/ 10721) 
he thought it was great that i was going to school but 

Recording: (6587/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6588/ 10721) 
god is in that you know um even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off in the winter time god is in that steam a lot of people can not understand that but um so the the the laws of thermal dynamics say that it is propal for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can not be heated to an adequate point of of withholding heat 

Recording: (6589/ 10721) 
nobody ever you know what they want me to do is put him on a relative and i did not like him on a relative i did not like what it did to him 

Recording: (6590/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6591/ 10721) 
um yeah give some charity and keep care of your bills and probably go on that vacation you have been dying for like you are making my brain water here ever australia 

Recording: (6592/ 10721) 
but i think you have to exercise the mentality once in a while too and it and that is trying to make it grow into uh to other levels of of uh atmosphere 

Recording: (6593/ 10721) 
so i mean it is something i am i am comfortable with 

Recording: (6594/ 10721) 
see people now all of a sudden there is a rash of fires you read that in the news and people keep doing it i think society as a whole has gotten a lot more violent which may be kids more violent 

Recording: (6595/ 10721) 
yeah we met um at where we there is a single is word where we call work it is on twelfth avenue down here and it is just where all the single people under thirty go to church and there is dances and different activities and 

Recording: (6596/ 10721) 
no no they take no they take the money whether you are in it or not you have no choice you have a choice as to whether you are a member or not but they still take the money and if you cross the line they will take that money back so anybody that yeah you know you are better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time i did some of that  yeah it is tough to you know columbus has a big you know job market there is everywhere you look there is help on it so but it is tough to get to job where you can 

Recording: (6597/ 10721) 
for a long period of time 

Recording: (6598/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (6599/ 10721) 
and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and and you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um uh principals driving big fabulous cars and 

Recording: (6600/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (6601/ 10721) 
and there is some people that deserve to be fired and there is no way that you can reallyifferent you just because they are in a union they 

Recording: (6602/ 10721) 
um umhum yeah and that is the way that is the way you really should be i mean uh got to be ready for tournament time you know i do not know if you have seen it or not 

Recording: (6603/ 10721) 
this would um concern but i do think i i do not know i mean the birth control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they can not take care of byebye 

Recording: (6604/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6605/ 10721)

Recording: (6606/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6607/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6608/ 10721)

Recording: (6679/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (6680/ 10721) 
uh where we put all kinds of information out on our own web site which there is so much it is very hard to find what you want you know it is it is that is a some problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it uh it it is a problem for us for libraries because there is just a barage of what they are getting and it is not just for must it is for the literature um there is 

Recording: (6681/ 10721) 
i was in the cub scouts 

Recording: (6682/ 10721)

Recording: (6688/ 10721) 
yeah i think they all get the option but i i understand very few exercise it so you know if they were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are using and then giving the two dollars an hour you know but then that could then you could say that oh she is helping to keep people down and so you have to still it is it is it is an odd balance there it is and like something like that does not seem too skilled to me so i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but 

Recording: (6689/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (6690/ 10721) 
i think it is more just a family preference i i prefer a family um

Recording: (6754/ 10721) 
yeah i mean you generally could i mean they did not broadcast it obviously but 

Recording: (6755/ 10721) 
it is just been so 

Recording: (6756/ 10721) 
it the conservatives the liberals are all agreeing on this 

Recording: (6757/ 10721)

Recording: (6761/ 10721) 
and that they are the natural natural powers which is good because they they are they get better care of their 

Recording: (6762/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6763/ 10721) 
they in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents so i did that until i uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years and then they okay to dallas so yeah 

Recording: (6764/ 10721) 
the yeah 

Recording: (6765/ 10721) 
some of them are pretty good at that some of them are not too hm some of them like when you have them copy like from this box down to this box these little shapes in a certain amount of time if their visual perception is messed up they screw that all up they you know the form goes this way they draw it this way their brain slips it around on them that is why they have trouble with ends and use and bees and bees and they are still reverseing you know you normal kids like 

Recording: (6766/ 10721) 
 you well in some ways it is i guess it is necessary but it is just you reminisce about the way it used to look and and um i was just at a place last night i was at this a public comment meeting for the little darby national wildlife refuse that they are planning for madison county and uh there were some there was some talk about that and it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuse 

Recording: (6767/ 10721) 
let us see i usually go out to lunch at like some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner 

Recording: (6768/ 10721) 
and it still is uh and that was the problem with school he just would not do the work i mean he would give him a test and he could pass it do really well but he just would not do the work um 

Recording: (6769/ 10721) 
hate him because he has all these big government things and you are against big government um so i do not think people always always see that but um between gore and bradley i do not see much difference right frankly bradley is the more liberal um gore i think understands and need to compromise but i think gore will be the the candidate i think bradley will be able to go past all of the work that gore is been doing for eight years is vice president 

Recording: (6770/ 10721) 
i think so he is he is not being forced to go in any direction that he is not ready for yeah i was going to college and and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so so he was very independent but i am not so sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put 

Recording: (6771/ 10721) 
yes hopefully 

Recording: (6772/ 10721) 
a couple that are adopted to be able to get counseling for her 

Recording: (6773/ 10721) 
i understand that but uh and then the one they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out you you know they give you a paycheck or a telephone they want to know where you are morning and night seven days a week and it is not another business um so uh the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an i quit an employer that understands my situation and and how i operate and well give me freedom to do what i can do i have a batch of 

Recording: (6774/ 10721) 
yeah it is the brady bill did not really do it for america like they thought i mean you know you wait five days big deal go out on twentieth avenue and pick one up in five minutes you know  i have seen all kinds of people carry guns that should not 

Recording: (6775/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6776/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6777/ 10721) 
that is not most worst though that it is not even a surprise 

Recording: (6778/ 10721) 
is is out to you but he happened to be one of my uh fellow students out of ohio university now how he happened to learn all these things like he did not i do not know i did not of course he started out uh he mow the he i think the very first thing he was a town chip trustee like paul was and then he it became the mayor of cincinnati and he was a very effective oh yeah he was a very very effective he was well liked it 

Recording: (6779/ 10721) 
i mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and say well get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tech tape record not a big real real thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh plenty of congress has it i will just try about 

Recording: (6780/ 10721) 
real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 

Recording: (6781/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6782/ 10721) 
like i do not know how it is in canada i think yeah it is got a big big arena like uh civic center or something like that and i i think that is really weird but that is like too big but um it is kind of it it is interesting here you you know you just go to like uh i mean sometimes they are at warehouses or or like auditor homes or stuff and it is just like dance music and lights and stuff it is real fun 

Recording: (6783/ 10721) 
we are finished 

Recording: (6784/ 10721) 
you know i think a lot of it depends on i do not know for each different parts of the country but the cultures and everything because you know it just seems and uh some parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there and a lot of them get married so young they just that is just what they want to do you know they do not but they are not thinking of any future wanting to go to college or anything like that i have to call is that okay i am sorry  i 

Recording: (6785/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6786/ 10721) 
really hate that um and like affirmative action and stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it is it is it is just executed very poorly i mean i saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get into places i mean sit down with begging me to come 

Recording: (6787/ 10721) 
you could but you could take it 

Recording: (6788/ 10721) 
yeah most of them think the freshman class just right along i think the freshman would be a little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to be walking around you know in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million halls around me and just stopped once and i said there was lasinby and they that way that is too far from our park 

Recording: (6789/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6790/ 10721) 
and uh other than that i just do housewifey things and you know after being it is the first i have been retired since last march so i am to being home and not being so yeah really and i mean i have to work at that because i have been so busy for the last twenty five years yes makes it hard 

Recording: (6791/ 10721) 
come on you know people i do not know i would hate to be in a predicament of having to change anything because it would be hard to change one group and not another 

Recording: (6792/ 10721) 
um probably would have been about six years ago i ran in sixth or seventh grade 

Recording: (6793/ 10721) 
uh yeah my parents live in akron uh like north of akron kind of falls area but like i said i my i had an apartment down there and but like for the summer i am down here so i am a transient always moving my stuff 

Recording: (6794/ 10721)

Recording: (6795/ 10721) 
i do not know i i kind of see alguer winning just because he is the most like 

Recording: (6796/ 10721)

Recording: (6797/ 10721) 
i mean that is a neighborhood mall and 

Recording: (6798/ 10721) 
he is right 

Recording: (6799/ 10721) 
i do not know um like i said i mean it is something that i basically see it almost as being the same thing as like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tired of things like that but as far as what it the effects it does to you it is no worse than anything alcohol can do to you um so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if they should actually go as far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time trying and 

Recording: (6800/ 10721) 
yeah his mom could not take care of him any more and he was like i think he was about fourteen and he just he he did not have really anywhere to go and luckily this family is had taken his different siblings different families took him i do not know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families that took care of him but um it was good for him because he is got that example 

Recording: (6801/ 10721) 
that like uh the parental influence is not as much as you know before then i think by the time that you are passed out of lessons 

Recording: (6802/ 10721) 
yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (6803/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah yeah it is been glamorous and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you know like seeing it was not real and i do not think they i think 

Recording: (6804/ 10721) 
well teeters is a school board member for columbus 

Recording: (6805/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6806/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6807/ 10721) 
i see 

Recording: (6808/ 10721) 
but just how it is just a a more of a like more of a closeness thing so it is more apparent how how segregation works or whatever 

Recording: (6809/ 10721) 
 right well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three  

Recording: (6810/ 10721)

Recording: (6818/ 10721) 
right but the ones the racine are the ones that are the standards in the fields but right and but more and more of those are also available on the map but you have to subscribe to them so it is still an institutional subscription i mean that is a constant problem for the serious people everywhere it just it is incredible what is happened with the costs yeah i mean i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year 

Recording: (6819/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (6820/ 10721) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because your black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same thing with like iers people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from 

Recording: (6821/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6822/ 10721) 
or on your hard drive um because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft or i will say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look could over have somebody else proofread it because you are not going to see the mistakes because you are too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say and and you are not going to notice them spelled phi m or they t h a y yeah or a sentence that is two 

Recording: (6823/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6824/ 10721) 
to help calm them down 

Recording: (6825/ 10721)

Recording: (6828/ 10721) 
i never learned math  we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables you know big pizza party plans uh 

Recording: (6829/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (6830/ 10721)

Recording: (6831/ 10721) 
you are like i am like hell now i am not paying  you know for a cat  you like honey it is just a cat  you know it is my   you you can come home and visit it anytime i pay you know oh right  

Recording: (6832/ 10721) 
yes i i mean that probably the circles i move in is what is coloring my whole view of columbus i mean there is a lot of the i am sure there is a lot i do not know 

Recording: (6833/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6834/ 10721) 
so she mainly stays at home 

Recording: (6835/ 10721) 
ooh 

Recording: (6836/ 10721) 
trip up multiple health problems he ran away for a while there was drug abuse alcohol and uh he was essentially asked to leave high school 

Recording: (6837/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6838/ 10721) 
um i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is it is like a it is a in the door if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and 

Recording: (6839/ 10721) 
not believe it they know it 

Recording: (6840/ 10721) 
so you know um it it is pretty pretty busy there but it it is spread out over the sixteen hours as where as poor columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eight a year and 

Recording: (6841/ 10721) 
and i do not matter what they are 

Recording: (6842/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6843/ 10721) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (6844/ 10721) 
uh she works at franklin university she is a assistant vice president there 

Recording: (6845/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6846/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6847/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6848/ 10721) 
with both of them but then the football players you know some of them were uh pretty uh pretty much asked us you know uh way to put it especially if they are got scholarships and stuff you know they are they could be real uh nasty but uh i just can say i do not know i just think maybe i look look at it back as like uh oh i have got into arguments with the few evidence you know and 

Recording: (6849/ 10721) 
any more you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down in the pieces or teach in a different way it is like teaching a math problem in two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing 

Recording: (6850/ 10721) 
he he is polite or given that much okay 

Recording: (6851/ 10721) 
came through and set up rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no 

Recording: (6852/ 10721) 
i would not worry that much about it 

Recording: (6853/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6854/ 10721) 
so i bought my house you know where i only had to drive two blocks but then i had to move to westernville and uh one of my jobs there was i was a hearing uh supervisor for a department and we had about a hundred and fifty people in the department that was growing and uh i wanted to hire uh minorities 

Recording: (6855/ 10721) 
go out and have fun person 

Recording: (6856/ 10721) 
i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i said in in general people are pretty good people 

Recording: (6857/ 10721) 
well i i enjoy this  but it it will be in personal uh because here you are i am not can not face you i i do not know whether you are really kidding me and what you are talking about sitting there in that in that uh street cafe or not but i really do think we are going to be interconnected in that since and uh uh it it becomes you so much more impersonal i guess i am very strong about the term personal versus impersonal in any communications 

Recording: (6858/ 10721) 
eventually 

Recording: (6859/ 10721) 
well um see he moved into an apartment over on eleventh avenue 

Recording: (6860/ 10721) 
yeah yeah people say things like oh i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer and i am just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game i was grading papers at the kitchen  table you know and if i go out of town on the weekend i have to take my school bag and all my work with me it never ends you know i put in about seventy hours a week during 

Recording: (6861/ 10721) 
a little but not not near you know like she is no 

Recording: (6862/ 10721) 
i think about putting my life on book but i do not think they make that many pages have a twenty thousand page yeah ten yeah ten thousand will be an introduction well it will start it  

Recording: (6863/ 10721) 
it is always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade uh you know it is i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short 

Recording: (6864/ 10721) 
 yeah uhhuh i do not whether i have ever pointed out 

Recording: (6865/ 10721) 
the only time i ever did 

Recording: (6866/ 10721) 
oh my god 

Recording: (6867/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6868/ 10721) 
acceptable so 

Recording: (6869/ 10721) 
which i she said that and i said 

Recording: (6870/ 10721) 
i help janet somewhat but not a whole lot i i have a project i work on not as much as i probably should but it is this lawn cleaners project and what we do we have little houses donation boxes in all this lawn cleaners and there is probably about um probably a good forty forty five of the throughout the city so i am in charge of that and i do some volunteer there that is for the benefit of the homeless family foundation and and 

Recording: (6871/ 10721) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralized it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age get a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure your 

Recording: (6872/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (6873/ 10721) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (6874/ 10721) 
and we humum it or what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested and books and 

Recording: (6875/ 10721) 
yeah there is uh some people there just get lazy and then you got the college students they i do not know how many of them work but most of them there is just from out of yeah 

Recording: (6876/ 10721) 
to uh you know to art whatever it is wherever it comes from and there is not the uh you know there is not the the old boy network you know not as not as much who you know to get into things uh or or that women are allowed to know that people that the boys know so it is not it is not as closed off that way 

Recording: (6877/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (6878/ 10721) 
very boring 

Recording: (6879/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6880/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6881/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (6882/ 10721) 
sounds good 

Recording: (6883/ 10721) 
yeah because it is all continuously mixed it is like the it is not it is not real yeah i like it how like the rapes it is kind of like faceless because it is like it is not more like rock star oriented and stuff it is more it is more like kind of a serious type type thing but but but not so like glamorous and like fame oriented and stuff 

Recording: (6884/ 10721) 
well i am not the mayor or anything so i am not going to make any promises  

Recording: (6885/ 10721) 
to control drug problem wise the things coming in i mean i know i think it is like switzerland or somewhere like that where they legalize drugs and they basically do a government based where the government actually gives them out and the government gets the money for it um i can almost see that as being almost a good idea here i mean obviously like i said people we are going to do it no matter what i mean the same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on it does not matter what they have to do to it they will they will come by it 

Recording: (6886/ 10721) 
no i mean 

Recording: (6887/ 10721) 
like little puppies 

Recording: (6888/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6889/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6890/ 10721) 
but you know and years ago it was kind of funny we seen him seen each other and everything and uh and that uh some place down in indiana and saturday night the term went amher that time i that is a yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (6891/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (6892/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6893/ 10721) 
i do not really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for liz but dole and then she opened her mouth and things came out and  and she had the best chance i any uh any woman that is ever run for president and she was in a major party which has not happened before and it would have been it was funny to see what happened to bob dole over it is you know be the first man after having run for the office 

Recording: (6894/ 10721) 
yeah yeah that is that is interesting 

Recording: (6895/ 10721) 
yeah and 

Recording: (6896/ 10721) 
never in alaska or hawaii but for all 

Recording: (6897/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6898/ 10721) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (6899/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6900/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6901/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6902/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6903/ 10721) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well but you know does i mean i it seems you know from what i have read if you wanted to make it is really uncomplicated you know so 

Recording: (6904/ 10721) 
oh yes 

Recording: (6905/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6906/ 10721) 
and work later that which was fine by me or he called me and said said okay if i work all night and would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that huh 

Recording: (6907/ 10721) 
that is a thing but the thing that some people some people say some people say well why do you do this and the thing is why do not you talk to those people say hey why not do do i am doing best i have a government the team 

Recording: (6908/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6909/ 10721) 
whenever he run well i thought he was going to be elected uh mayor two but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but uh uh you know he is got his constituents and they are going to reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes the mistake is saying things races that are not necessarily races but anyway 

Recording: (6910/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6911/ 10721) 
that so that if you if whoever won you know would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time  in my be better now 

Recording: (6912/ 10721) 
and and no legal sanctions are going to make any particular difference to the attitude you have going into it 

Recording: (6913/ 10721) 
that would probably change my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6914/ 10721) 
yeah it is a tour it is a package tour i mean i have room floor and it is a bit then it is just visa yeah does not interest me 

Recording: (6915/ 10721) 
yeah i somebody is got to get get you know put george bush to the back 

Recording: (6916/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (6917/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6918/ 10721) 
waiting and they all want to go right now you know and that is how most airplanes are you know they all they do not think about anybody else they think i am here why i why i am not here first you know so 

Recording: (6919/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (6920/ 10721) 
and how was it  

Recording: (6921/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6922/ 10721) 
or they use the bible to say well you know god is specifically says and it is chapter not to partake in spiritual activity well who do you think wrote that you know 

Recording: (6923/ 10721) 
 and um yeah i uh uh i would never i would i would never want to go back to the old way never 

Recording: (6924/ 10721) 
yeah so basically i learned with him you all have to do this do that 

Recording: (6925/ 10721) 
because she enjoys cooking and makes it a little bit easier i tend to over cook the meat  

Recording: (6926/ 10721) 
that 

Recording: (6927/ 10721) 
 and you know that their parents are not going to they are not going to say no the anyways 

Recording: (6928/ 10721) 
a little geographic would not hurt 

Recording: (6929/ 10721) 
my current church and got plugged in there and i met someone there um in jane eyre this year we dated for two months and then i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said where the person i am going to marry and that 

Recording: (6930/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6931/ 10721) 
yeah right because uh you like uh i i always keep using my oldest daughter uh she can uh get up in the morning and brush her teeth and just early coma her hair put on a shirt and a pair of pants and go somewhere because she is comfortable with herself she does not have to be made up she does not have to look perfect now my youngest one has to do that and the oldest one i look at her as you know i like myself and if you do not like me well 

Recording: (6932/ 10721) 
i just hope he stays around i i i do not know maybe not but i grew up without a father and i really um have that against my father because he lived dur on death he never caught us you know it and i really got resentment against him 

Recording: (6933/ 10721) 
that would be like you know what the hell they they put on all some kind of gay raise the mickey gay yeah 

Recording: (6934/ 10721) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they meant no huhuh i i would come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i you know used to live in the country and i moved into a smack avenue in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (6935/ 10721) 
in the meantime you know  you have got to pay the bills so i you know i am not sure what she wants to do she is had so many different kinds of jobs parttime jobs though um you know i when she was younger like ten years years because she wanted to have her own talk show 

Recording: (6936/ 10721) 
he is an educatorator which is all the more reason the whole school  because he sees it and he is like yeah they 

Recording: (6937/ 10721) 
you know and everything and all that actually no my my father killed himself this morning you are kidding so you you end up after a dozen or so people narrowing it down you have got you are kidding you are not serious no 

Recording: (6938/ 10721) 
um well i have had the house excuse me um for probably six seven years and we just need to move it is kind of small it is a smaller house and um my husband works in bahana so we were going to look for some houses up that way and maybe some land i have been looking at some land up north too 

Recording: (6939/ 10721) 
no they were from all over the world i had um one companion who was from russia but she was on a temporary mission i mostly all over america but but there was a girl from mongolia uh there was girls there who i never was companions with them but they were from russia different there was a girl from moscow um my mission president was actually from saint petersburg and his wife they they did not speak english  

Recording: (6940/ 10721) 
uh i was a little bit on the past side yeah i 

Recording: (6941/ 10721) 
um one of the requirements is we have to be in the honor is college during undergraduate only uh fulfill all the requirements there 

Recording: (6942/ 10721) 
i would like to see them what was going through their heads you know but that is something we never know 

Recording: (6943/ 10721) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade in eleventh they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are going to have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know oh i am going to play in a rock band you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drumers and and you know they could care less about anything and it has not hit them yet this is my real life 

Recording: (6944/ 10721) 
um about yeah do we get her we have had her for two years yeah we did about six months we went to hawaii and got his brother married and then we came back we need that would be the last long trip um and we were going to wait till this spring but we could not so we went to rescue service and got her yeah 

Recording: (6945/ 10721) 
would have been a lot better i think for myself for than everything you know i mean for you know we would have been able to had uh joint custody with her and everything you know when she was growing up because we are well by her being out there i mean you know you can just imagine she is you know been being a girl not saying girl any bad about girls being my daughter you know worry about things in school and weekends and stuff like that so where if i was closer to her 

Recording: (6946/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6947/ 10721) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital umhum those things happen 

Recording: (6948/ 10721) 
thank okay 

Recording: (6949/ 10721) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (6950/ 10721) 
i feel like i should just stand out there give it money because my bills are getting me high 

Recording: (6951/ 10721) 
i do not think i do not think that is going to ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think this so called divorce rate program was i talked about a while ago that uh every or fifty percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

Recording: (6952/ 10721) 
i mean there is nothing bad about them or anything that they 

Recording: (6953/ 10721) 
rather gym 

Recording: (6954/ 10721) 
and then there is the one that is like oh yes i had duke is off at christmas well i used to work at hurting hospital as a teacher when um i first went to worthyton when i said i got another i got a job working at hearting hospital as the i was a principal but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day and i was also the administrator because they had a small all school there for the kids that were in the adolescents unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credits somewhere so the doctor is always used to 

Recording: (6955/ 10721) 
help him uh be able to move into the i think he can get out of the apartment by sub sub leasing it but yet to get the seventy five dollars to give to the land lord to they charge seventy five to do that to advertise and um  screen 

Recording: (6956/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (6957/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6958/ 10721) 
definitely 

Recording: (6959/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah you can not ignore it i mean because you know because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word but uh um now everybody knows and um anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called a fabricate  and and so it is better if you can and defuse that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but ooh i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6960/ 10721) 
that is okay  vietnamese indiana 

Recording: (6961/ 10721) 
but having having done it before you know and uh knowing where i went wrong you know uh that would not happen again uh i have been on that ship for a while but but again i was back in the uh actually it was in the nineties the early nineties but you know i was been doing it when we were we were we were uh recreation type of thing you know not as they uh daily you know uh somebody can knock on 

Recording: (6962/ 10721) 
what it is is most people want do not want kids that live in reality 

Recording: (6963/ 10721) 
more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars a piece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (6964/ 10721) 
oh okay is that still called valley 

Recording: (6965/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6966/ 10721) 
yeah but guns are always going to be around you and you are not going to get rid of them 

Recording: (6967/ 10721) 
now i worked at the library when i was a student 

Recording: (6968/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6969/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6970/ 10721) 
computers that figure it out just to see it to see it and uh oh and then they the uh we had to locate our positions on a map 

Recording: (6971/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (6972/ 10721) 
right umhum i never went back home 

Recording: (6973/ 10721) 
that is it 

Recording: (6974/ 10721) 
um that that you had two dads 

Recording: (6975/ 10721) 
called my mom first and i told her i am on my way up and then called the irs and cincinnati and told him that he owns a disney is got this and this and this and he paid me and this other guy under the table this much and you are technically only allowed to have so many hours a day to be doing free jobs or tax free jobs and uh i was agreeing with it and so you got on my bad side 

Recording: (6976/ 10721) 
you see 

Recording: (6977/ 10721) 
you know i have never i i used to uh have an office out there that i visited all the time but uh i have never been out there to she actually lives in kirkwood which is a suburb

yeah and they are all so different but he is he deals real well with people so he is really and he is even thinking of going into uh business for himself yeah he almost did that this eah and then he is fat no i do not want all the headache so he is like the top guy of of the people that he works for so 

Recording: (6979/ 10721) 
well right now i think he knows enough i am just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i am pretty i am like wow i can not even build the stuff that he ability makes ships and cars and rockets and  

Recording: (6980/ 10721) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirit in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the wall is very true you know i can see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (6981/ 10721) 
well they always did because first time i had one i was thirty six years old 

Recording: (6982/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6983/ 10721) 
it is yeah because pediatricians are able to dispose it and um i just you know felt like trying to avoid as much as possible you know growing up 

Recording: (6984/ 10721) 
oh yeah um we just do not really talk about that very often and i am just 

Recording: (6985/ 10721) 
nobody really admits it but oh i grabbed the paper because i want to see what the agreement was and it is pretty much the same thing and they are looting positively for it this time 

Recording: (6986/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6987/ 10721) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not cheat on them 

Recording: (6988/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6989/ 10721) 
and outside of english french is a horribly popular language for different countries to have as a second language so i think it would be extraordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french 

Recording: (6990/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (6991/ 10721) 
always have the gun well obviously that is not true you know uh my personal belief is that we are at the right to bear arms uh if you are a illegal and everything i am not really sure the background checks really do that great of a job 

Recording: (6992/ 10721) 
so i guess i mean that went that was really really hard for me i would just call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what to trial needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crime spell but he did go who that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (6993/ 10721) 
and they fly checks like if you write a check today and you deposit it in the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearinghouse and that is all they do all night long 

Recording: (6994/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah the five year old just after the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know 

Recording: (6995/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (6996/ 10721) 
just like premarital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you did not 

Recording: (6997/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6998/ 10721) 
yeah and we just had a van who took time to 

Recording: (6999/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (7000/ 10721) 
and just started picking a fight with them 

Recording: (7001/ 10721) 
yeah but and i said fine i do not want to even think about it so it is kind of like 

Recording: (7002/ 10721) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but uh that is interesting uh uh you know when the when the first when the uh where time began you know according to life uh what i had believed in and everything you know was man or woman got married you know and and the reason they got married is because of procreation you know keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so 

Recording: (7003/ 10721) 
do not you think 

Recording: (7004/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7005/ 10721) 
yeah i am going to give up this life here and go to the third world and live or let us let us let us reverse busting hey okay up arlington you live in northwest side why do not you go down live on the side 

Recording: (7006/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7007/ 10721) 
 yeah yeah 

Recording: (7008/ 10721)

Recording: (7009/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7010/ 10721) 
um yeah 

Recording: (7011/ 10721) 
that would be good 

Recording: (7012/ 10721) 
very slow very methodical and we take them to dog and my husband is taken them many times for when they had to have cat or that operations you know so he is involved with the girls too 

Recording: (7013/ 10721) 
i do not think that my victim that was so close to me would want me to do you know so 

Recording: (7014/ 10721) 
oh see 

Recording: (7015/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7016/ 10721) 
yeah it is just like uh having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicted it could screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors  yeah 

Recording: (7017/ 10721) 
which she wanted to do you know and he may have been stupid and a cat but i do not want to know about it on day one when it hit the the news i did not want to know about it and on the end when he was you know not impeached i did not want to know about it and in between i did not want to know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen and not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the police of of where america is on such issues as gun control and 

Recording: (7018/ 10721) 
but our had to start on development so  

Recording: (7019/ 10721) 
oh they are they are very good they you call i usually just call and i walk down and by the time i get there the subs already 

Recording: (7020/ 10721) 
and there were people that were opposed to the wilder refuse mostly people that lived there near there farmers and but it seems like the one thing that almost everybody there agreed was they did not want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments and uh that we somebody was talking about the difference between development here in the united states and in europe um and how development in in europe tends to 

Recording: (7021/ 10721) 
right and you know the all the babies in the hospital be covered under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not very very big 

Recording: (7022/ 10721) 
yeah and a lot of them is been getting off the hook lately you see this guy on uh hard copy he killed this woman is husband because he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions now i think that there is there is uh things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide yeah 

Recording: (7023/ 10721) 
i i like to talk about columbus  

Recording: (7024/ 10721) 
 columbus 

Recording: (7025/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7026/ 10721) 
and that burned his part i told now i do not know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or whether he went up on his own but he went up to the store and uh i think i do not know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she so when he when i came home she told me what had happened i said well that just can not be 

Recording: (7027/ 10721) 
yeah there is a there is a girl at the store i was talking to and uh she saw how i wrote my signature if you look right there sjustif i was a doctor 

Recording: (7028/ 10721) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am a reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influents upon the political uh influence that it is almost a four going conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or next uh next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (7029/ 10721) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (7030/ 10721) 
can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get much i mean you know that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that could not ride um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit 

Recording: (7031/ 10721) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did not but it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to as to and he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he wrote a lot and 

Recording: (7032/ 10721) 
whereas i do not know lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (7033/ 10721) 
big ball for it do they have like little babies that care in their patches like kingrews 

Recording: (7034/ 10721) 
we do not know who is in the airplane and there is there are c planes that do come in out of there 

Recording: (7035/ 10721) 
and i think i am gonna well i really like the rising military because it shows discipline responsibility respect for you go to the columbus public school and the kids will rash out on substitute teachers i think it is really crazy um i think you should have a lot more respect for your elders your adults 

Recording: (7036/ 10721) 
you know they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland color plano all those school shootings and can not believe i mean i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (7037/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7038/ 10721) 
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where you are going to put it 

Recording: (7039/ 10721) 
um that uh well well i know about the grill and masks and but and that you know i it is a a women is organization uh to promote women artists and and to uh object to the to the male hierarchy you know that that only only men get are in the museums and only men get the big gallery shows and stuff like that 

Recording: (7040/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7041/ 10721) 
you like the university level 

Recording: (7042/ 10721) 
you look forward to coming home you know and the pet is waiting on you 

Recording: (7043/ 10721) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying attention a lot you know like i read the columbus about every day and i read us news and world report for my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (7044/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7045/ 10721) 
you know what i mean you can not do this you can not do that 

Recording: (7046/ 10721) 
i always understood each of the noise stop whining so my father and i are i am going to start getting phone calls here in a little bit i will just push the phone so my father and i now it is been the third time understood each other much better than my mother and i did um we were able to communicate in uh very similar fashions we did not always agree and in fact i probably more diameteric where it was to him than anybody else i ever got to play with um but at least understood what was going on from one moment to the next and so 

Recording: (7047/ 10721) 
uhhuh uhhuh 

Recording: (7048/ 10721) 
and i do not know whether i am i i do not think a second sister ever went to school out there but uh things were sort tough but and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and uh got her teacher is certificate so i guess in that agreed that if they could find someone to stay with i skied through the 

Recording: (7049/ 10721) 
so um there is from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it 

Recording: (7050/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7051/ 10721) 
there is too much information and too much change uh libraries seems you know this is against probably what the image of libraries are they are very very eager to um raise change uh internet came out and you know when it and when it got out of the area of it was being used by universities or whatever for research that sort of was at first cons were right there and they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they can do with it uh when pcs yeah we 

Recording: (7052/ 10721) 
that is where my father is from 

Recording: (7053/ 10721) 
but the best majority are engineers i like math and science so i figured well engineering i do not have any other options i must be engineering so i came to college and i got into the honey is engineering freshman freshman engineering on his engineering program called the gateway program engineering is the hardest field to study besides probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really 

Recording: (7054/ 10721) 
no no it does not 

Recording: (7055/ 10721) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution and that will fit every every child in every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus 

Recording: (7056/ 10721) 
and when they get home they do not want to do anything so they pay that yard down they do this dad da dad and dad it is like they have then they always go we have no money and it is like because you pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know it is it is like you making your soup you know when if and when you have children when they get my age they are going to go i can remember walking around the house and going m mom is making bean soup her mom is making vegetable soup her mom baked a cake it is like as opposed to opening up oh here is a wire cake you know  

Recording: (7057/ 10721) 
umhum i think his mom was pretty you know does not really talk about it want to talk about it he comes from his his real biological cold family is very um i do not know if you would call it just functional or there um he did not live with them after he was fourteen or so his it was just so bad that his his mom could not take care of him and his his siblings so he was pretty much on his own but he 

Recording: (7058/ 10721) 
well i do not think growing up we did not we it was not really called sex ed um they talked about the female repeduct system nothing about men which is kind of funny you know it was always the women in that chart you know 

Recording: (7059/ 10721) 
i heard something the other day that really it really upset me i was at a this convention downtown convention center and uh one of the lady that was presenting one of the work shops as a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear 

Recording: (7060/ 10721) 
no i i am just a player you know i mean they lost uh four or five different uh top notch players that went to the pros and most of them are starting or you know so uh old cooper is thing is we do not rebuild or unload you know well sometimes it takes a couple years to unload you know but i have never been a guy i was thinking of cooperier so  they just says some stupid things 

Recording: (7061/ 10721) 
it makes me angry that people like that even get money 

Recording: (7062/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7063/ 10721) 
oh definitely  

Recording: (7064/ 10721) 
so i was shut out of the job market then you know and that did not bother me i thought well fine i went that is when i got the job of channel four but uh it is like anything else some for good some black use it for bad 

Recording: (7065/ 10721) 
a little different 

Recording: (7066/ 10721) 
the risks in what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone the high part of it 

Recording: (7067/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7068/ 10721) 
maybe 

Recording: (7069/ 10721) 
the same everyday not just like a lecture and but then we do homework and turn it in like you know it is like we do like like a history class we do like role role plane things like 

Recording: (7070/ 10721) 
 right i keep thinking oh i want to go back and take some classes you know i keep thinking i would go back to school but i can not even narrow down what i would want to take there is so much stuff or so many areas that are interesting to me umhum 

Recording: (7071/ 10721) 
well the minor league hockey team the columbus children are there they do not have it now but uh because the blue jackets came out but but i think it would be good if it goes but i am just not sure that columbia is going to support something like that that is basically a high state you know and now i need support to uh hockey team we got right on state you know and yet they are good 

Recording: (7072/ 10721) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have paid off about five years so then we are talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (7073/ 10721) 
and it it is kind of weird because you when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7074/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7075/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7076/ 10721) 
i i do not like wia i i do not i do not i mean they my uh i guess my uh mom was a democrat and my dad was a um 

Recording: (7077/ 10721) 
yeah right before i feel like to do that 

Recording: (7078/ 10721) 
exactly yeah 

Recording: (7079/ 10721) 
pars i know she was planning on going to uh saint louis university which i wanted to go to missouri university of missouri but 

Recording: (7080/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (7081/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7082/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7083/ 10721) 
do it the hard way to the easy way well i think everybody should have to do it the hard way i and frankly um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it 

Recording: (7084/ 10721) 
yeah i think they do 

Recording: (7085/ 10721) 
not that i have seen you know 

Recording: (7086/ 10721) 
if they hold you know enough of my views i am not going to vote for a woman just because they are a woman i am not going to vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have you know at least and and i do not need a hundred percent uh agreement with my views but i would like to be it in the ninety to ninety five percent range um but uh i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have i have moderated from when i was uh in college to today 

Recording: (7087/ 10721) 
and then when i went out there she had uh security remove me off the premises that following monday because i was supposed to go out and sign something for a least did not really happen that way i went and signed it and i came back to school monday thinking yeah well another day another dollar or whatever get there and they go ahead and out door 

Recording: (7088/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7089/ 10721) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a i need to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning material i mean sort of i mean i i mean it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (7090/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7091/ 10721) 
when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and as an under current it was not over in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion and it is a very deviceive issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divides them you know the to to finish it almost like in vietnam almost 

Recording: (7092/ 10721) 
i i knew that kindergarten because it is it is not required in the state of ohio anyway they really are not required to be in school and ruled in anything i am until they are six by september when i found that i was like oh okay cool you know can keep him home i mean he is he could probably go into the second grade i i mean he is very bright he can read and write and add and he he you know he is so it is a challenge for me  

Recording: (7093/ 10721) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and players umhum um i do not know it is northland is such a a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um a hurting or you know a neighborhood that people do not need picking so i did not see the difference of having both i mean there is ladders everywhere there is sears everywhere or not why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to players 

Recording: (7094/ 10721) 
to see the end yeah yeah 

Recording: (7095/ 10721) 
and plus the mental health aspect of it the other thing 

Recording: (7096/ 10721) 
umhum umhum but i do not know if that is i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce how would that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after the divorce is final i mean does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (7097/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7098/ 10721) 
it is so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually 

Recording: (7099/ 10721) 
and he does have a responsibility but i think there could be a line drawn how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been you know 

Recording: (7100/ 10721) 
where are you from 

Recording: (7101/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (7102/ 10721) 
it is just not wasted 

Recording: (7103/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7104/ 10721) 
and you do not the problem is as a youngster you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably until you are about thirty five forty you do not realize my goodness i am saying you may have sacrificed because no i am learning and learn more what you did and then by the time you are uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you are got to take care you know to carry your parents if you had the morals to do it otherwise just ship them off to the farm 

Recording: (7105/ 10721) 
they are forty two and forty one soon to be forty one so uh i think that their childbearing years are over 

Recording: (7106/ 10721) 
you know every set of thing again  like oh okay we went for the big bucks we went for the time off everybody makes their choices now you got to live with um 

Recording: (7107/ 10721) 
kids because they are only little ones that is what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated they are only little ones and they will be grown up right know it because 

Recording: (7108/ 10721) 
 well models to look at and not just playing round ball or the the spiro we need to get them out there and say how you are going to perform in school yeah i am sure michael reds got some mentor out there you see guys were number five and whatever the number is uh eight and whatever it was okay they there was a reason for it but what is what is the other part of it we do not do it because why we do not want to bring it up but we do not want to bring them someone is embarrassment possibly or 

Recording: (7109/ 10721) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and that would speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nancy i changed my name i went to college i just decided i am out of here i am everything is gone and so she would say uh nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please and i would think i am a child here i should not have to be the one to make peace with this family if he does not want to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (7110/ 10721) 
i know i wish i knew how to sew  i can do buttons that is about it  umhum 

Recording: (7111/ 10721) 
you know you know argentina wire and by wire and all those like a big big uh brick wall and whatever you could actually you know still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to pursue the history of it okay right yeah so you actually it is like it was like because you were like a part of that history at least when you were over there 

Recording: (7112/ 10721) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (7113/ 10721) 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder 

Recording: (7114/ 10721) 
quote unquote really just really just ways but i do not believe somebody going to church makes them a better you know being the next person uh because there is a lot of typicality church uh these kids i i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i have i remember hearing a lot about too who was the one they had not picked on 

Recording: (7115/ 10721) 
he is a picky eater which he is yeah he he does not like everything 

Recording: (7116/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7117/ 10721) 
and uh but the thing is is southern baptist uh service always has that period where you are 

Recording: (7118/ 10721) 
day and what a problem  you with you with you with you and you with you had those kind of problems huh  

Recording: (7119/ 10721) 
um well as far as my mom goes she is real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (7120/ 10721) 
 say  

Recording: (7121/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7122/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7123/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7124/ 10721) 
i do not know but if everybody is ever gone i am going to i will i will find some i am sure 

Recording: (7125/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7126/ 10721) 
i know i know 

Recording: (7127/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7128/ 10721) 
and just get out there and have fun and then like we left uh probably like four days a week i know i do not look like it but  but i go with them and have a good time so 

Recording: (7129/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7130/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7131/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7132/ 10721) 
so it is going to be tight for our family for a few months you know to get back on 

Recording: (7133/ 10721) 
yeah it was like yeah um it was five weeks early delivering so it was really you know replanted as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (7134/ 10721) 
and i understand that mentality now because i went back but i will tell you the reason i left was it sounds stupid but he took my teddy bear which i love and i have had for not since i was a child but at least five years at that time and he just he knew i loved it 

Recording: (7135/ 10721) 
oh it is possible but i can not imagine it would uh i not knowing how big it is going to get i guess i can not imagine 

Recording: (7136/ 10721) 
i dont know 

Recording: (7137/ 10721) 
yeah exactly you can bring that in house i think i mean i do not know i might go out like like we should and be completely wrong so 

Recording: (7138/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7139/ 10721)

Recording: (7176/ 10721) 
um i got into painting somewhat recently uh i have always done a lot of art uh my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed art as a child uh did pretty good too but i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing and just uh you know three or four years ago i thought oh kind of learned how to paint and they learned how to paint 

Recording: (7177/ 10721) 
yeah i have read that i need to try that just for winter even 

Recording: (7178/ 10721)

it is regular is enough for me in that and i did not have i could not schedule the owners 

Recording: (7180/ 10721) 
people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is an animal the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other it so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is in ail anymore because i did not give it to you i can not take it back you 

Recording: (7181/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (7182/ 10721) 
we want  but so i think for a lot of times people do fall in just sort of but i i was not is it mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i and just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i am also not afraid of 

Recording: (7183/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7184/ 10721) 
yeah i have met a lot of different people in there lot of interesting people 

Recording: (7185/ 10721) 
oh that is an fortune  she 

Recording: (7186/ 10721) 
oh i am not shocked to the bad behavior in i do not consider it is justice 

Recording: (7187/ 10721) 
yeah it is like the uh the woman that used to live in the apartment where we lived before us see she had a husband she was married to for quite some time he got on ohio is number one dewi list with eighteen dewi is well can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you think your first ti offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and we could 

Recording: (7188/ 10721) 
whenever it comes on i roll my eyes that episode where they were stuck out in space and uh just if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes hum 

Recording: (7189/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (7190/ 10721) 
so that he got down in uh an area under that concrete floor the concrete was about so deep which 

Recording: (7191/ 10721) 
well yeah where we are just send a if you get sent to one of the tv rooms and have like uh oh for one first time we are gonna get it all over the world you know every united states or something so people really here maybe it would might do some good if people would begin to speak up you know uh why do not they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what do people really think would help there instead of having things like oprah rinkley and because there is other couple guys that get on asked the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (7192/ 10721) 
and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mountain vernon area and uh they got very little money but i was not heard  

Recording: (7193/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7194/ 10721) 
and then how so as far as that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people so but we can learn from them they put them on spot light but we somehow we do still wanna uh i guess flood them up the we do not want to get the negative answer because oh my  image of the university oh gee now who was it catson mower or something like that 

Recording: (7195/ 10721) 
well her major is communications it did not start out that but my daughter wants to write books okay wow  

Recording: (7196/ 10721) 
groundding it there so that they can go forward 

Recording: (7197/ 10721) 
i was looking out the window and like the other one that says i did not hear what what was the question and uh they are they are a&d and they can not quite focus and distracted they can not screen out the distracted but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are i know they are they are the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle there is are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling and they are kind of spaced out and daydream and and 

Recording: (7198/ 10721) 
day she could play and she wanted to play more 

Recording: (7199/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7200/ 10721) 
uh brass feeding there was a lot of that i think it is all these programs it is like oh we need to talk about this you know they are all kind of uncomfortable um 

Recording: (7201/ 10721) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (7202/ 10721) 
oh sure 

Recording: (7203/ 10721) 
um sort of like make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do what they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (7204/ 10721)

Recording: (7213/ 10721) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a a lot of like between the lower in the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle income middle income in it middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the opera and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that uh 

Recording: (7214/ 10721) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with um chief jackson and the whole mayorial candidates how they are getting into baylor for that and i know this is something new on top of that um i know it was from page them sunday is paper i looked at it briefly um i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (7215/ 10721) 
full scholarships uh my son went there one year uh it was a disaster for him

Recording: (7219/ 10721) 
yeah well she stayed um she stayed with us like for the first week and then she was down she was like ready to go so and that was okay but her apartment at least was up the uh week that she was in the hospital having the baby so i had to move her and uh my husband is family was visiting at the time and so his mom stayed she lives in florida and she stayed with me and helped me pack her whole apartment and get her into a new apartment and and that was 

Recording: (7220/ 10721) 
out of touch with everything that is going on in the room and i do not have a like a regular size class like i will have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven high school

Recording: (7226/ 10721) 
caused any harm but 

Recording: (7227/ 10721) 
i think it is good and uh i you know i think women are are capable during that my only disagreement with it is that i have a real problem being in that box hole and have a woman beside me and uh she gets shot you i do not know how i could deal with that if you uh men uh i do not know if you women have you know different feelings but with about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other uh than they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective 

Recording: (7228/ 10721)

uh well a lot of my kids do much better with writing on the computer because they know that they can go back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they can even get or they can maybe even get sin tax help if it says this is awkward or something turn the sentence around so my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the computer than if they are asked to do it pencil and paper so that is what i make them do their webbing you know what a webbing is 

Recording: (7236/ 10721) 
yeah i saw that patient in the morning

but the third trouble is we do not fit the horse with the proper carryage load and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a team there is no sense having having five yards in the basketball team if you do not have a stick i can tip it off and rebound it 

Recording: (7252/ 10721) 
totally 

Recording: (7253/ 10721)

Recording: (7254/ 10721) 
um beethoven i think it was beethoven that did not talk until he was like seven and they thought he was retarded but you see these people just their brains wire differently than ours is and you just you can not ever expect them to approach any like you would because they will not it just does not seem logical to them they are usually real good at puzzles they are usually real good at you know things that 

Recording: (7255/ 10721) 
so it is very parttime and i am a full time student so i was working somewhere else before but it was i needed somewhere on campus

see that they have their little kids and now you are going to be going for chemical therapy radiator and all this stuff you know and it is unbelievable how many it is just hard to believe how many people go through there they are talking fifty sixty patients that day 

Recording: (7260/ 10721) 
in favor of uh publicizing it and all that i do not see what they expect to gain i mean it is they in fact i do not i do not think that they do gain anything by uh 

Recording: (7261/ 10721) 
honey is cloth is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but 

Recording: (7262/ 10721) 
umhum uh well my oldest one is really odd because uh the school she goes to it is sort of like uh thrift store sheek and a lot of kids there go the thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said you know we are not in the poor house you are not buying clothes at the thrift store so she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh you know because she just looks like a bum i think and you know when it was time for like a uh a a dance or something she would go out and buy a a dress you know 

Recording: (7263/ 10721) 
i would love to do it but even when i was skinny my knee will not let me 

Recording: (7264/ 10721) 
i moved to louisville kentucky 

Recording: (7265/ 10721) 
it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings so i mean there is a i mean yeah the animal therapy is a very good thing my dog it is been very um supportive and very you know like you said the unconditional love part you know i mean how you could you could you could leave for a week and come back and they are they are like okay  i am glad you are back you know 

Recording: (7266/ 10721) 
it is just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i have not been ever uh told them my degree matters by any employer or a country to what the news tells you and what people will tell you all go get that that college degree uh you know people told me soon as i got out of college then i needed a master is so 

Recording: (7267/ 10721) 
um i liked it there is an episode i think it was in the third season where they were stuck on an island or island 

Recording: (7268/ 10721) 
but other than that much dirt  so uh whenever they we heard any firing like that was coming toward us we we for that whole 

Recording: (7269/ 10721) 
 uh no i do really believe that they if they would have something like that instead of some of the even the oh shows they are no good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes i turn them off for some of the stupid things they do 

Recording: (7270/ 10721) 
was that right 

Recording: (7271/ 10721) 
right yeah it was like oh this makes sense and you might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this  so i will get that a little slice and pick the rest so that worked out 

Recording: (7272/ 10721) 
have some well personally i vote as the the thirty three shirts half on the issue way i am i am yeah picking something like that i think it was around two years ago it was allowing things to be done on a wonderful letter it was a last year of jimmy rogers and everything that and i wanted that i 

Recording: (7273/ 10721) 
and they would have made it so i would not have had to make the decision i mean that was a hard decision to make 

Recording: (7274/ 10721) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and and with um my husband he is it is his he is the oldest so for everybody 

Recording: (7275/ 10721) 
i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustice of the past or not the the the hypocracy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff that that is why i am i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kind of preachy  like this is my position 

Recording: (7276/ 10721) 
that is it oh 

Recording: (7277/ 10721) 
yeah and she said you know and and the the last three or four years she just wrote it out so she could retire and she seems to be very dedicated uh very dedicated teacher and she just it was a job then and it is a hate to see that happen to good teachers

Recording: (7288/ 10721) 
right and i think that you know i think that just because you know you do so because i know i have done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse has sent me to take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for for a as long as i could 

Recording: (7289/ 10721) 
but you know it is they will it is constitution and stuff like that you know they always bring it back our forefathers did this and our forefathers did that well our forefathers also were squattered versus that mean i could move into this room

Recording: (7323/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (7324/ 10721) 
 um not to sound like a broken record but i really think it is our uh back slide on on family and i think it is too easy this day i and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me um that it is to easy to get divorced um people do not really go into marriage with commitment in lifetime and have that i do not want to say 

Recording: (7325/ 10721) 
like this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent um the the opposition is criticize the advance 

Recording: (7326/ 10721) 
it is just major thing that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (7327/ 10721) 
yeah i have heard that too different it is different and it you know i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worst you know and i then you can talk to some other people that are oh you have not seen anything yet wait till they just do not even want to be in sight with you and do not wait till they and i am not going on vacation with you 

Recording: (7328/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (7329/ 10721) 
gas i mean it is like people are wearing things and like wanting to go into college and stuff 

Recording: (7330/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7331/ 10721) 
yeah my husband was one of those 

Recording: (7332/ 10721) 
they are not 

Recording: (7333/ 10721) 
i paint sesame street or something i do not paint sesame street there is something from childhood that i paint and now it is somewhat mainstream so it sounds a little funny i also i have painted the couple of por uh pretty happy with of some friends i that have done a selfportray um that kind of thing 

Recording: (7334/ 10721) 
i do not think it would hurt me not knowing it 

Recording: (7335/ 10721) 
in the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you probably have a lot of empathy for them 

Recording: (7336/ 10721) 
dellant does not seem to work too swiftly 

Recording: (7337/ 10721) 
like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or cut school and huh 

Recording: (7338/ 10721) 
the leaking you know the ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad chock boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought this um schools are so bad they said we are not going to support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite check we went in and we said you know eighteen months later and the board put another they are uh of of living on the the ballot we said these are great school we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement 

Recording: (7339/ 10721) 
and she did this and she did this and this and they are going to go oh you know it is like you know what what what do you want to at the very end you know so 

Recording: (7340/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7341/ 10721) 
i was going to say i i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to be at home and the husband support them and in the situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is umonia and all that kind of thing and and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know 

Recording: (7342/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7343/ 10721) 
that is what we figured a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean there is times when we did not know where he was for a week or uh a week at a time he i was driving a uh the lane avenue once and so i am baking money on the street and that is it is it is pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (7344/ 10721) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (7345/ 10721) 
no that is not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that but a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (7346/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7347/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7348/ 10721) 
uh so she does not want to take the baby home so they are arranging some other things we have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time but we think it is going to be too hard for us 

Recording: (7349/ 10721) 
do not you think too that the that the more they have found out psychologicallyally speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the uh throws of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and and i both know the exotic experience from being one of eleven children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (7350/ 10721) 
and there is people like that today still you know but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh uh and uh sit down and make a visit to them every week make a part of life and develop a friendship 

Recording: (7351/ 10721) 
what 

Recording: (7352/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7353/ 10721) 
you know because i just think it looks so awful when you can not you can not even admit to what you what your opinion is 

Recording: (7354/ 10721) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the doors and i was you employee 

Recording: (7355/ 10721) 
years ago there was a citizen i do not know if you were what you are background is where you were were not here but you are not but citizen journal was a daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the diskette was much more liberal they used this it it was a morning paper and then it was an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same pretty process and everything and then to scratch when their lease started would not renew their lease 

Recording: (7356/ 10721) 
uh she is real good yeah yeah everything is healthy and great um she and then my daughter i mean i think she is just going to be a real good influence she is a my mom and um the father is in another relationship and probably on his way to be getting married and you know so it does not look like he is going to be in the picture that much and she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him to be too so because he 

Recording: (7357/ 10721) 
 yeah it just should be we are all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (7358/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (7359/ 10721) 
in my respect oh yeah but i see everyone is engaged in a senseful behavior because in my in my religion everyone is sense um i am a i am a christian i go to an all denomination church i do not like the nomination i am not 

Recording: (7360/ 10721) 
because somebody has totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you under that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and she is gonna go she is she is gonna quit her job and go to um uh um working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (7361/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (7362/ 10721) 
yeah i think so i think so and like they neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me you know so 

Recording: (7363/ 10721) 
yes umhum 

Recording: (7364/ 10721) 
we will go to different web sites sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to everything  

Recording: (7365/ 10721) 
you are much bigger and you can control the thing and keep it away from her uh yeah but but i do not know what somebody else told me what they can watch and not watch that is major but i do not know how i mean it the media supposedly i mean he may not supposedly this may be the way it works to be pedi uh presents the stuff and people watch it or read it or whatever they do not but it is fun it is like the constant garage that this is what you get the monochleum and ski stuff 

Recording: (7366/ 10721) 
uh once she was there with her pregnancy but she did and i am just going to do public school 

Recording: (7367/ 10721) 
a good philosophy to go live by uh and people of other religions and everything but you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raised basically but uh i practice more catholic than anything else now uh but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judiism and muslims and umhum just because they find it interesting 

Recording: (7368/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (7369/ 10721) 
and i looked at it and i thought introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader than that so i ended up coming up with class that was it was only nine weeks two it was only nine classes um so it was about a two and a half for three hour class each week for nine weeks and uh i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly in uh visual art and for the second three weeks 

Recording: (7370/ 10721) 
uh that is why okay 

Recording: (7371/ 10721) 
tiger falls 

Recording: (7372/ 10721) 
yeah we had a my mom has a friend that does all two sounds 

Recording: (7373/ 10721) 
time it was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pet and julete lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (7374/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7375/ 10721) 
did not have it done through sierra money nothing like that and even the man that he followed for a while is sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now because he is old he is on his way out and he was a road man gave his life you know for eighty nine tribes to help them find and refined their connection with their spiritual that they would lost um because of the missionaries bringing christianity i mean um 

Recording: (7376/ 10721) 
uhhuh uhhuh 

Recording: (7377/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7378/ 10721) 
sayed was not happy there anyway so then took a couple months off and did some consulting was worked on a consulting project at a for about six months and then when that project ended just same time and ended my fatherinlaw was diagnosed it with cancer and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they do not they were from philadelphia so uh i became his care giver for about three months until he died and then to 

Recording: (7379/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (7380/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7381/ 10721) 
uhhuh uhhuh  

Recording: (7382/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (7383/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7384/ 10721) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (7385/ 10721) 
oh yeah oh yeah it used to be when they first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 

Recording: (7386/ 10721) 
that is because it is kind of like mormon shopical is that is why they like it down there 

Recording: (7387/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7388/ 10721) 
as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it is yeah i mean when it when you come down to these things there is uh people with mental illness and with the disability are trying to plan off the responsibility on to everybody with themselves you know well the medical doctor if they would have seen this guy and given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody you know shoot a wood of cut him in a if the guy stopped taking his 

Recording: (7389/ 10721) 
was it hard 

Recording: (7390/ 10721) 
and they are far as cool 

Recording: (7391/ 10721) 
and so when my sister and i graduated what do we play each boy each other a dog baby and i got mine to this day because i will not even let my daughter play with her you know 

Recording: (7392/ 10721) 
his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed no that is not necessarily his opinion is what i am trying to make a point there  but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from uh uh various people within this community or whether whether you are talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be and yes i i then 

Recording: (7393/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7394/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (7395/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7396/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7397/ 10721) 
similar with her communist  

Recording: (7398/ 10721) 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the face the same as the rest of the children did but no i am i am very happy and content with her decision yeah very much so as as a matter of fact i manically julie the tulsa she and her husband both baptists they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and 

Recording: (7399/ 10721) 
you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemisphere is pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs a show well then and that is when those reverseals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm 

Recording: (7400/ 10721) 
years ago because it was well it was right there where there was a lot of people population and everything and then like i say if you are gonna be there you got basically the people moving and out to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff you know not that they are moving away from it they are still getting into it but uh just your perspective on uh then you would have to if you build it they were kind of the same you know so umhum umhum 

Recording: (7401/ 10721) 
even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university they are uh you do not hear any like whole like universal negative things about this about the university yeah 

Recording: (7402/ 10721) 
yeah probably will yeah 

Recording: (7403/ 10721) 
your three houses that they had to take out here 

Recording: (7404/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7405/ 10721) 
but uh her mother stayed with us for several oh two or three years and she was a babysitter for her oldest boy 

Recording: (7406/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7407/ 10721) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes to visit and amy is you know my mom you know huh look up okay bye amy that is it 

Recording: (7408/ 10721) 
um currently unemployed umhum 

Recording: (7409/ 10721) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education uh but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of probably in a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or 

Recording: (7410/ 10721) 
uh well take for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we would wait till the surgeon went and she had and we just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out 

Recording: (7411/ 10721) 
um i may um it is kind of a unique position i i guess i may um my job title is a senior research associate um uh i received my um bachelor is master is phd in a nurse practitioner all from here for my issue and i am working down at do not hall in a research position i am also a nurse practitioner down there that um these patients and follow up and in clinic um they sort of created the position for me about a year ago after i had my little boy 

Recording: (7412/ 10721) 
he was having problems with his adopted mother and he was in a an all a all night restaurant and he was bragging you know that he met this me and the man took him home you know he slept at the man is place and i was told do you know how dangerous uh you know that had been for a year and uh he thought it was cool you know so you know just things like that 

Recording: (7413/ 10721) 
yeah  i can not really take her with you  yeah you can not get her in you can not get her in it would be eighteen mean to get into dance clubs now but um that is uh those are the two really really really tough ones that a lot of people will uh will will 

Recording: (7414/ 10721) 
oh george oh do not you i do not know i have not really formed an opinion i can not 

Recording: (7415/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7416/ 10721) 
but obviously you would try to steer them more in whichever direction they are most suited for you know as far as as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much hum to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you would think that you can you know there is something you know hopefully that i do not know 

Recording: (7417/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7418/ 10721) 
a couple of restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus or more of a 

Recording: (7419/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7420/ 10721) 
not way at least we could move around a little bit but uh 

Recording: (7421/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7422/ 10721) 
umhum we got a few ideas um i am thinking that might you know be true i and 

Recording: (7423/ 10721) 
main campus the same 

Recording: (7424/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7425/ 10721) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (7426/ 10721) 
but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they would come in the men 

Recording: (7427/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7428/ 10721) 
develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish beings not to the sacrifice of what we should be doing and we are all all more tool and we are all going to be in that and we are i am not saying no one makes those errors makes errors it is always there the problem is just try to stay focused on that not a jump ship you know you say in this country oh you do not like leave it 

Recording: (7429/ 10721) 
and they do not wear like the loud how i even shirts in the in you know the shorts and the camera that that they do not do that 

Recording: (7430/ 10721) 
nothing serious now 

Recording: (7431/ 10721) 
oh you are trying to ask an easy one do you that is that is really 

Recording: (7432/ 10721) 
so i mean basically the entire winter i would either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight and i have i was really starting to feel it physically 

Recording: (7433/ 10721) 
so that is a little it required i am thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it 

Recording: (7434/ 10721) 
born to have more time with him um i do not know it is a whole different society with email and the uh computer in the and some uh the south phones i mean it is in some regards it is much more connected but some impersonal and i think uh moms being outside the home i think so many families are forced to do that 

Recording: (7435/ 10721) 
i was like okay all right what are the advantages and he is like do let us just put on your computer so i am like all right fine i do not care so we put on my computer and i have had nothing but problems since i do not know how anyone can run two thousand if they do not know what they are doing i am trying to find drivers because i have had to find i have had to find drivers for everything and they do not oh yeah and also it is directed towards businesses it is nc technology which is designed for network businesses and well anyways it is got 

Recording: (7436/ 10721) 
yes i do uh about i try to visit at least uh at least two every two years we either we go to new york or we meet halfway couple years ago we met at penn state and uh so you know the older ones are all dying off though so 

Recording: (7437/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (7438/ 10721) 
this is the game we play every weekend it is it is uh okay game um monday night i usually come up with something dumb and things occur 

Recording: (7439/ 10721) 
well i i told him you know i said something we told you you were not to do 

Recording: (7440/ 10721) 
we like teach english to little kids or or help clean or work at libraries or different things 

Recording: (7441/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (7442/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7443/ 10721) 
chancees or shances whatever from alli female so that was her name from alli she thought boy they are nice in this country they even named my baby for people are so stupid 

Recording: (7444/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7445/ 10721) 
what did you do just like do the turner is thing when you visit all this 

Recording: (7446/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7447/ 10721) 
i guess what can i do 

Recording: (7448/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7449/ 10721) 
that uh that is an interesting question because he was a a serious contender last time i have not heard his name this time um what people say they would do you know that they like like him because he is um intelligent charismatic uh all those those neat things that you need to to be elected today um and a lot of people said they he would vote for him but what they say in polls they do not know if it would translate over yeah i think he could i think the right candidate could and i think mike coleman this year uh in the 

Recording: (7450/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7451/ 10721) 
oh we do too we make vegetable soup and chili 

Recording: (7452/ 10721) 
if if we ran score sports i mean the game of sports not the the administration of sports is just as unethical as a business world it is unethical and that is one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we have emphasized sports along with a theater as being oh the way to go and the the poor the poor bench marks you could have in terms of financial uh uh appreciation sure you can the thing is you 

Recording: (7453/ 10721) 
if they want to get married that is their business i do not think it is mine or anyone else to say that they can not 

Recording: (7454/ 10721) 
and she goes well after i read the book i ask him a lot of questions so maybe they did not give it to you  you know like uh we do not want to go through this again because she is a little older than me i thought that was hilarious 

Recording: (7455/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7456/ 10721) 
just different stuff it is different every day that is why i like it just like with utah and people it is different every day 

Recording: (7457/ 10721) 
i think more along the lines of like physical abuses things like that um would be probably crossing the line um i think if he got there are alleged uh excuse me if he was allegedly beating his wife or something like that obviously then yeah then that would cause a problem with i i can not say that i would vote for anyone like that but i mean just like small things like that where it does not really 

Recording: (7458/ 10721) 
yep uh we do office parties and you know everything like yesterday we had to go to an attorney is firm and just fruit and cookies and you know i mean people tend to have food more and more you can not believe gourmet lunches and you know things lot more than they did let us say ten years ago 

Recording: (7459/ 10721) 
oh that would be awesome 

Recording: (7460/ 10721) 
that is  kind of tough going 

Recording: (7461/ 10721) 
yeah i do not do a whole lot of it but i like to travel 

Recording: (7462/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7463/ 10721) 
um you have to take a foundation of courses 

Recording: (7464/ 10721) 
and you did not even have your violence and stuff like that i have never heard you know i am just using pop right now 

Recording: (7465/ 10721) 
one sixty one was like you know all new and this is the place i want to live you know 

Recording: (7466/ 10721) 
and then there was another girl who i really did not think was that smart she is kind of um in her blonde and she got in yeah uh 

Recording: (7467/ 10721) 
no more than five because there is a specific um what is called the five paragraph essay the first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion three in the middle is the body that develops your idea so i am teaching all my kids right 

Recording: (7468/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (7469/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7470/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7471/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7472/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7473/ 10721) 
i did i did 

Recording: (7474/ 10721) 
but maybe if it if it would have stayed small maybe maybe i could notice some kind of difference that way but but i never i have not noticed anything 

Recording: (7475/ 10721) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy cosy i have a 

Recording: (7476/ 10721) 
all of them they can afford a house if they get bored they will go over the book and they will go over that book and start looking for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent now however my one son is gone two far he is got one rooms completely lined with books and a hallway part of it is just books and i do not know whether the kids ever go over and pick those up or not because they are always going to the library see see it is what is taught at home that really counts but we do not need all those material things and i am sitting back and thinking well which 

Recording: (7477/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7478/ 10721) 
what do i want out of life 

Recording: (7479/ 10721) 
well i could see them you would be running it that whole time 

Recording: (7480/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7481/ 10721) 
yeah it it might i mean good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching um and and i was doing some volunteer work at doubleen schools was supposed to be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter right the answers to the question and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence yeah 

Recording: (7482/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7483/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7484/ 10721) 
okay i could not because i do not think i would know that one whatever looks pretty when it comes to 

Recording: (7485/ 10721) 
you know at lunchtime they would be cutting their next class you know there is two different lunch times sometimes they just alternate and take two lunches or go to one class go to one lunch and skip after then but 

Recording: (7486/ 10721) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get to travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really want to see chicago is not that far washington is not that far um new york uh you know i do not get to new york that often but uh you know i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i want to go to the trouble 

Recording: (7487/ 10721) 
um well maybe not columbus in particular but i do not know i was i think i was just a little because i was doing the tomatoes and i was i had a heavy course load every quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so i had you know done seven straight quarters and i am sure that attitude and i had a lot of hard classes and you know i was just tired of a hard state and tired of being here and you know red tape and 

Recording: (7488/ 10721) 
their day care oh i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of day care offer it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice a cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a toss up it is a real 

Recording: (7489/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (7490/ 10721) 
totally only she has  then i told her if it was me completely alone i would be in the middle of a city somewhere you know where you see people and i do not know you know it is just you can always see what someone else should do or could do or whatever 

Recording: (7491/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah very much so 

Recording: (7492/ 10721) 
typical dorm 

Recording: (7493/ 10721) 
i in fact that time one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but course that would have been uh forty nine so it would have been probably what about twenty four so that about twenty five years and so i think we are getting ready to get to have a house anyway 

Recording: (7494/ 10721) 
you know and what is the point of staying married and being miserable i think it is better to get a divorce than 

Recording: (7495/ 10721) 
no matter 

Recording: (7496/ 10721) 
i like that ask me i mean i do not know i do not pay attention to who the writers are um so maybe the writing has changed 

Recording: (7497/ 10721) 
yeah there were some of them ended up dropping out 

Recording: (7498/ 10721) 
i am not sure uh i am not sure that the the federal government has the ability to convince enough people to do it and i do not think it is i think the people that are going to be ready to accept it and go with it are i do not think we are going to get a good cross section of the population i think the people will be willing to understand it and go with it more they are going to be the more educated in this 

Recording: (7499/ 10721) 
my dad is the only weird well his some of his brothers and sisters are kind of out there too but  

Recording: (7500/ 10721) 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so forced but as well i mean i i came um just before halloween and you know i i walked into the grocery and i mean just like right there we are just like cakes cop cakes because you like everything just right in front of you with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean all the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it is such a money making you know and it is so over the top where there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and there are decorations and 

Recording: (7501/ 10721) 
uh not really  he is kind of between the west and the south area southwest and 

Recording: (7502/ 10721) 
but the other you would you would be fine you would be you would not buy anything that you did not think you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (7503/ 10721) 
they are but they are stupid laws  

Recording: (7504/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7505/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (7506/ 10721) 
basically because the plans which the utilities had for our location they could not provide to us because of the uh the best you are ruling so we had to go out and um during our own surveys become self educated through uh courses uh through at&t and through purdue university it was and they go oh you had some courses and and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but um the projects basically where we were going from a uh 

Recording: (7507/ 10721) 
whatever they feel i mean if they feel comfortable um with being like that that is fine but i do not know i i do not know if i would talk about the but maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they are like well what should i do  

Recording: (7508/ 10721) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (7509/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7510/ 10721) 
you have heard of the andrew beach head we will go up there and get around behind him 

Recording: (7511/ 10721) 
they 

Recording: (7512/ 10721) 
time for 

Recording: (7513/ 10721) 
getting electrocuted or something yeah that just does not appeal to me too much but i mean it is really not too difficult i mean as long as you are careful and 

Recording: (7514/ 10721) 
no i did not know anybody in high school but in college i know some people that have used coke ex to see it was more after the movie go 

Recording: (7515/ 10721) 
yeah well my little family all graduated megan was first in her class joe is rank first my brother phillips rink iowa was not  he would have but they are all they are all straight four point 

Recording: (7516/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (7517/ 10721) 
on creating an equal and fair society um maybe somebody left it positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where where in the social stradom you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these class i mean i i do not want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations because 

Recording: (7518/ 10721) 
they do not have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play and if you take a string player that can not play in tune it can really wreck everything  yeah but uh i think we have improved a lot we we gave a concert uh a couple weeks ago at a church in upper arlington and uh i thought it went pretty well went a little bit of mozart uh some concertos yeah 

Recording: (7519/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7520/ 10721) 
yeah got more people would buy presents for though  

Recording: (7521/ 10721) 
yes you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in the family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the spring back oh you came from this little tube here oh okay that that is the principal effect no i have to be because there is no father here well 

Recording: (7522/ 10721) 
not that valuable but they that is what they thought so you get it for well you and then you you prove up on it as they say you you just build buildings and yeah and born and and uh so that you live on it and uh i think i do not know i suppose far enough certain amount of it i mean put in where either or whatever and uh and then after five years you get a title to it george 

Recording: (7523/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7524/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7525/ 10721) 
were at least every other year we are out there 

Recording: (7526/ 10721) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (7527/ 10721) 
totally like the directions and the homework and everything is all one hundred percent injury 

Recording: (7528/ 10721) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom as long as you are listing to them uh some people i do not care what their ages they just blow them off uh so that plus you have the i think an understanding of um the schooling they came from um 

Recording: (7529/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7530/ 10721) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brotherinlaw is gay and when i met him i knew he was uh you know he was the type some of them can not tell it does not matter what they look like um but my husband said all through growing up he liked men he did not like girls he looked at  magazines because you know all the stuff and i thought that is so funny because grown up i just did not know know anybody that was um but you know he was openlygated to his mother right from the beginning 

Recording: (7531/ 10721) 
i am real quite a bit of that 

Recording: (7532/ 10721) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it whatnot and then and it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always stressed back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (7533/ 10721) 
we got divorced in eighty eight 

Recording: (7534/ 10721) 
i remember a time when i was a brand new teacher i was maybe fifth or sixth year of teaching i still pretty new and this john i said john what your last he said yes i said i do not feel like guessing tell me your last name he said yes i said john i want to know your last name and he said g u e s s  i am like oh sorry thank you 

Recording: (7535/ 10721) 
no no no it is not you can do it every once they are uh i have heard conferences where the uh i have heard the profit talk about how you should keep in touch with people that you served and or the people that you worked with and that you knew and and that they even if they can not you can not remember how to speak try and  send them a i have been really about that so i feel a lot of pressure that i need to i mean it is it i just do not want to lose contact with them 

Recording: (7536/ 10721) 
but to go see something like cats or rent they still charge you out the really okay 

Recording: (7537/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7538/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7539/ 10721) 
it is my baby and then oh you are having a baby that is 

Recording: (7540/ 10721) 
nothing and having people like that come tell me you are got to go to work tomorrow so i went upstairs and knocked on his door and told him i quit  and uh he was not very thrilled about that but one of my students was a uh controller and uh he came and talked to me and he says uh he says i i heard you quit and he says i want to tell you about my job and he was  control at owensboro kentucky and uh he said he worked forty hours a week and i go well i usually do that by wednesday and he said that he had uh 

Recording: (7541/ 10721) 
that is 

Recording: (7542/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7543/ 10721) 
that that is nice to be to  that is nothing that probably would compare to yours in australia gosh 

Recording: (7544/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7545/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7546/ 10721) 
uh about fifteen minutes my mom and i do not go too far from each other so but jameson is going to take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (7547/ 10721) 
well when he is telling my friends that their grandparents went to hell because they have a different religion 

Recording: (7548/ 10721) 
because the priest they had there would not let him take community and all the other kids were taking community and and that is pretty much the priest decides that and he and he felt singled out when he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with it uh but it has some kind of problem uh i am not a a just person myself but i am not against it and if i and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well the teaching values 

Recording: (7549/ 10721) 
i am guessing 

Recording: (7550/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7551/ 10721) 
and i suggest the shot the the death of probablyro because that is what i am on now and that way you do not miss any pills that last for three months you know and and that is what i was suggest for you know 

Recording: (7552/ 10721) 
no the problems are only given out that day even the teachers do not know what they are going to be and it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood or it might be something as specific as when you were little what toy was your most favorite and you have to write five paragraphs on it so well huh huh 

Recording: (7553/ 10721) 
and i do not think that it is just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all 

Recording: (7554/ 10721) 
say uhhuh 

Recording: (7555/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7556/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7557/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7558/ 10721) 
developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (7559/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7560/ 10721) 
it can go up and like feed them and 

Recording: (7561/ 10721) 
my name is 

Recording: (7562/ 10721) 
and a lot more um different suburbs so maybe it is it is going and and becoming a little wealthier 

Recording: (7563/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (7564/ 10721) 
my husband lived in a town a small town in southern ohio where the dentists in town were three brothers and they were named pain pain and pain dentists and that was spelled p a uh yeah there is some funny name stories out there boy but people just go nuts with their kids names i just think would you wanna why would you do that to that kid carol harold uh 

Recording: (7565/ 10721) 
yeah you are professional and your wife is professional i says that is how you are evaluating it on both of us yes i said i do not want to do business with you well i am going to give you a loan i said i do not want to do business with you because you did not ask me about my goals my goals was not they have my wife work because nowadays it takes children to work i am just wondering when they are going to try labor law to revolt that because 

Recording: (7566/ 10721) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (7567/ 10721) 
which is not really not a lot 

Recording: (7568/ 10721) 
she did not she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (7569/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there is something missing into the uh uh the child is life you know uh uh that he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be built in bombs and in their basement and mom and dad not know 

Recording: (7570/ 10721) 
umhum yeah we would like to garden and that was one of the things too we want some space to to make a bigger garden and uh no no we kind of helped my neighbor out he is got a big garden next door so we helped him and she is tired oh  

Recording: (7571/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (7572/ 10721) 
not specifically no but sometimes um little groups uh sometimes if there is a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign um and we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign um but it was very difficult it is sort of like getting people who live in in a trailer park active in voting you know there is certain little blocks of people and on school levels the people who voted know which were senior citizens 

Recording: (7573/ 10721) 
to get them to do what they do to even to help like blind people or to um help people that have other physical disabilities um you you can tell from the way the dog is in terms of uh with with the the way the dog behaved with the person that has the disability uh that they have been trained for um you can tell whether they have been trained the right way or whatever so 

Recording: (7574/ 10721) 
things that typically women do because that is my job that is my tradeoff you know i do not have to go some place else i can get i can go and have coffee every day with my daughters i i can go you do whatever i want and i am happy to do these other things 

Recording: (7575/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7576/ 10721) 
the should have been in class 

Recording: (7577/ 10721) 
my father died when i was two so i think just being raised you know by a single parent 

Recording: (7578/ 10721) 
yeah i 

Recording: (7579/ 10721) 
fuses on a lot of things um like that it is dry they have a real strict visitation policies things like that and my thought is if you are in the if you are if you are you are considered adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (7580/ 10721) 
what is different is my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle i mean still is my elementary schools sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oh and ten cheap billies i am right in where i always sweat i mean i am i was raised on cuomo avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat 

Recording: (7581/ 10721) 
and i did not even you know and i knew my mom is like if she can save a nickel somewhere you know she will so i knew that that is how they were and i did not want to you know it was my choice to get married it was my choice to have kids and you know i did not i did not feel the need to ask them um well i think 

Recording: (7582/ 10721) 
well he is working part time at last year us but really he does not have anything so i am working 

Recording: (7583/ 10721) 
you know it is a real worried and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough to drop them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh jeez are we doing the right thing you know but you know some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know there are 

Recording: (7584/ 10721) 
i ever would have before 

Recording: (7585/ 10721) 
bruce in belgium so i have a game going on with a good friend of mine named michelle i have a stupid ring here you see the ring so um i have lost so something like two incernations of the spring just flat out lost them because well i am an irresponsible cost and um one of them a third if you will i get to her 

Recording: (7586/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7587/ 10721) 
well yeah 

Recording: (7588/ 10721) 
uh yeah they uh near near west side is always been a pretty bad area well in the last forty or fifty years and it is starting to creep west 

Recording: (7589/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (7590/ 10721) 
went on i am not sure about the rest 

Recording: (7591/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7592/ 10721) 
they are trying it just does not seem like they are thinking ahead 

Recording: (7593/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7594/ 10721) 
oh i know it i know it that that is really what is hard 

Recording: (7595/ 10721) 
none whatsoever 

Recording: (7596/ 10721) 
and i mean it is basically any time i have free i mean it is not like i have a set schedule of when i have to work and things like that it is just whenever i feel like i have to do it 

Recording: (7597/ 10721) 
uh civil rights uh uh a a sense in our society that anyone can not you like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute why 

Recording: (7598/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7599/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7600/ 10721) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months of the first quarter so uh then i get my notice in january so 

Recording: (7601/ 10721) 
i have no idea you know 

Recording: (7602/ 10721) 
his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (7603/ 10721) 
 you should be real attentive to what is happening in his school situation his or her 

Recording: (7604/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7605/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7606/ 10721) 
i mean the drinking teachers i have usually been around for a really long time and i i would tip i my views are typically a little bit more democratic but uh not to say that i certainly would not vote um for the person that i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (7607/ 10721) 
i mean some really 

Recording: (7608/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7609/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7610/ 10721) 
there is uh you know just uh it was i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and uh there is a word called sink christity 

Recording: (7611/ 10721) 
 exactly  

Recording: (7612/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7613/ 10721) 
i was a teenager in a way 

Recording: (7614/ 10721) 
it is probably family by family i mean  that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there there we have got two coworkers one um how is her child with the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and i am listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she is dropped off at six am and not picked up until six thirty pm and she is fine with that me personally there is no way because 

Recording: (7615/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7616/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7617/ 10721) 
the catholic schools 

Recording: (7618/ 10721) 
kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back but um i just think that we are just too open with that and there is got to be a line to say this is as many people as is we care to you know i mean i know now that is hard but and and it is hard to draw the line but then other countries if it is so miserable there then they need to work work on there that country because 

Recording: (7619/ 10721) 
as much as she could yeah we were poor but we managed 

Recording: (7620/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7621/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7622/ 10721)

people are more scared of you than you are of that 

Recording: (7658/ 10721)

Recording: (7667/ 10721) 
eg it 

Recording: (7668/ 10721) 
that comes back to the lack of our morals and the like so yeah and our society promote it they are doing the tax laws and they are all government you said government do this government is doing it to themselves 

Recording: (7669/ 10721)

more uh family oriented uh uh your your friends are basically you know you count them on your hand it is what you still can but uh but you socialize a lot more if you are in a city with more people or uh more if you come from like the smaller town you tend to socialize with a certain people you know group or whatever 

Recording: (7682/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7683/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7684/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7685/ 10721) 
than if they wait later on in their lives you know but some sometimes i guess they change you know most of the men i knew right off the bat you know no i mean i mean it was not it was all through their lives it was not just though they just said well i am going i am going to be gave 

Recording: (7686/ 10721) 
to do that 

Recording: (7687/ 10721) 
really you know what is happened to a million dollars is still out of out of our out of our range 

Recording: (7688/ 10721) 
uhhuh i learned about them from somebody i was working with who liked them and listened to a lot of their music and he loaned me some i taped it and i saw their video their wall street grill of video i do not know if you have ever seen that it was fun  it was fun 

Recording: (7689/ 10721) 
well i wanted to give it to missouri or uh or come here but she was only reason you want me to come here is because you get football tickets or something  

Recording: (7690/ 10721) 
when they get home that is fine but um yeah it is it is it is another thing where you are it is another thing where you are focused trying to focus on your work and you know a lot of day never alone  so and um but you can live where you serve you can do whatever you want after you are done 

Recording: (7691/ 10721) 
uh a spiritual guide i keep telling these guys guys uh my daughter and son excuse me that uh you know they would come to me for answers and i think now i do not know that is i think probably the other problem is sometimes made as the the uh siblings or the children do not have a parent to go to but again let me rate rate rate our rate we do not have a smooth marriage 

Recording: (7692/ 10721) 
yeah i i want to  have to um do it  

Recording: (7693/ 10721) 
you are you are you are intelligent you know 

Recording: (7694/ 10721) 
the americans are if you look at opinion polls um so you know you have to find a way to to moderate that stance uh whether you are republican or democrat 

Recording: (7695/ 10721) 
umhum umhum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the moral in the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there whatever and the kids um they are 

Recording: (7696/ 10721) 
well it is you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around and i mean that is why let us off half a new because i could not you know but you know just everybody all the neighbors being allowed and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (7697/ 10721) 
that that is what is making these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (7698/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (7699/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i do not see any particular reason for her to wear the standacks except for to appeal to a uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which i i think it does oh 

Recording: (7700/ 10721) 
they have been married what four or five years and i think they have left six different places they are just constantly on the move they just do not have the connection with the someway and and i do not know if that is a bad thing it is just they are not 

Recording: (7701/ 10721) 
think and maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so traumizing to them like that would be like for four years every day you are just like teet or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (7702/ 10721) 
great we were already writing curse already that is all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe you might be learning something though yeah she is in fractions she is doing fractions she is doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one too  you know and saying uh it is just seems like they are three years ahead so 

Recording: (7703/ 10721) 
especially the guys yeah  

Recording: (7704/ 10721) 
yeah i uh well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either going to down size or they are going to do something and they always so i was never really shocked and i did not panick or anything and i was never without a job i never had to i never missed um you know i would say 

Recording: (7705/ 10721) 
a simple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregon is not that great but you know they say and you that even the dishwasher have phd is  well that the uh the level of the year your of education per capita is probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (7706/ 10721) 
are there other important roles where were those nuns be where was your mother possibly been she went to catholic school i take it where was she been is it went for the nuns why do we put none is down hey they work a lot less than your mother is income is there for her and they have a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (7707/ 10721) 
i mean it is just too dry it 

Recording: (7708/ 10721) 
their bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a true sense on the floor in a room because but i mean now that is bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things there i i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (7709/ 10721) 
and the other one is mcdonald is 

Recording: (7710/ 10721) 
i think  umhum 

Recording: (7711/ 10721) 
the way the america is going or whatever the youth um and like i say i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (7712/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7713/ 10721) 
you should be getting pretty near 

Recording: (7714/ 10721) 
in the federal government to collect occupational day and we were kind of a condue it for the state for that uh people they wanted an hourly rate they did not want to arrange they did not want they they wanted a number and that is what that was gospel but it is based on survey data so and and you know there is always patistical where and there and stuff and try to explain that we spent more time when people have called them to information explaining this is what this really means 

Recording: (7715/ 10721) 
giving on um the average number of children that these women were having and you know you know the average number of children that were just he can take to the hospital and left there or you know just dropped off wherever and and the state that these children were in and their life span and everything else i mean you know you know there is the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the the child is life you know i mean i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and 

Recording: (7716/ 10721) 
i got on birth control probably when i was like sixteen or seventeen but still i did not take the pills all the time and you know that was not very good me neither 

Recording: (7717/ 10721) 
but at the same time i do not think i would really hold it against him 

Recording: (7718/ 10721) 
the university never has money that is like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i were two year or two jobs for ten years while i was here at the first ten years just to make a living 

Recording: (7719/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (7720/ 10721) 
yeah and i had sold with the well i made it i knew that what had to happen on the outside which is really only some uh minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the front yard and then we have there is a guy who works for me who is um i just do not know how he can how he makes a living because he is very very reasonable he is also very loyal to me he is done stuff for me for years and uh and he is not that old he is probably twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow pat went in we added a bathroom there was a bedroom we added a half bath off 

Recording: (7721/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7722/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7723/ 10721) 
yeah like a lot of people like i do not i do not know why a lot of people go but like with a lot of people i know it is like go to hear really good music like it is amazing like what happens you know like people together and like people dancing together you look out and everybody is dancing you know i like the music is really good everybody is really into it and 

Recording: (7724/ 10721) 
yeah and and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they have got their input and i think that it is just a mixture of everything 

Recording: (7725/ 10721) 
yeah and then i went into the army in nineteen forty spring of nineteen forty one before fort harvard and that was my service for oh four and a half years in italy most of that time north africa and italy and uh i admitted i i got before i went into service and so 

Recording: (7726/ 10721) 
um you really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values but but but good values i do not care whether they are older or but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that uh devoted exclusively for this so that those students came 

Recording: (7727/ 10721) 
and i just sit there for a minute before i take it out i take it on out and sit on top of the line i said well mommy said a bad word i guess that uh mommy has to have subaru and her mind does not you i get a piece of those in my house not even 

Recording: (7728/ 10721) 
you know just you it did not even matter because you look at the wall right there that is pretty much all you have seen you would see tail lights as you passed people outside the there is only people on the road 

Recording: (7729/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7730/ 10721) 
the lawyers the judges everybody that works in that system i do not care who they are there is not an honest one in it i do not care there is not an honest one they might think down but once you expose yourself to corruption you take that in with you 

Recording: (7731/ 10721) 
that is not a punishment he was off his rocker there is not anybody who murders who is not insane 

Recording: (7732/ 10721) 
well when you get into the black population you will sometimes see some 

Recording: (7733/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7734/ 10721) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (7735/ 10721) 
no humans are violent by nature i believe i mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it it is more or less detered they caused his violence it is not media just like the extra c was in advertisement showing what you could do tv is showing you violence that you could do if you are driven to it 

Recording: (7736/ 10721) 
do not say oh well your son is going to be gay he is two right now let us you know change this so it so it does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (7737/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7738/ 10721) 
and so yeah but it is just uh god out of control 

Recording: (7739/ 10721) 
let us see 

Recording: (7740/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7741/ 10721) 
normally i would say no but yeah i do just because let us face it i probably cant do it anyhow and i would feel better for them and if if they used it because uh you know it is not good for the children that are born it is not good for them um um i would prefer abstinence but let us be realistic you know i think we are past that point now um i know a lot of christians argue up and you are wrong 

Recording: (7742/ 10721) 
basically uh it is just the talk and stuff it is not uh like you know what i mean i i am black i am better or i am white i am better it is none of that 

Recording: (7743/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7744/ 10721) 
oh i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting so i am more practical yeah it is a little more problem solving less right around the shooting things you know um it is like problem solving type you know little puzzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it is you create your own entertainment 

Recording: (7745/ 10721) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really good get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself when you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (7746/ 10721) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um

Recording: (7761/ 10721) 
i think the point is there on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself racist at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things like you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough 

Recording: (7762/ 10721) 
they are covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some she was a us citizen she found a love through email over the internet back in the early like in nineteen ninety it was real early i went over there and married the guy uh and so she had some of the medical problems and she emigrated and uh it was just it took years to get that straightened up but she is covered now

umhum yeah 

Recording: (7771/ 10721)

Recording: (7772/ 10721) 
course everybody else could but basically what it was uh it was a weird situation in high school 

Recording: (7773/ 10721) 
umhum yeah hm after uh now it is saying looks cool public school district she probably districts had the same as here but by being kirkwood you know or or small and everything um i take we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class you know so um 

Recording: (7774/ 10721)

Recording: (7776/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (7777/ 10721) 
and that is true uh so that is the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god this is too damn big for me to handle do you think you can i am maybe helping to change this person is heart or their mind because i can not do that um so you know i did not mean to get off i did not sure 

Recording: (7778/ 10721) 
here uh and now that is the most news worthy story out there so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it the media 

Recording: (7779/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7780/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7781/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7782/ 10721) 
just you know just let people make their own mistakes and then but do not make me pay for it yeah 

Recording: (7783/ 10721) 
a crystal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination this year that she came out of it is not part of it anymore the nomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apollo christian we are talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the german is read in three different languages yeah 

Recording: (7784/ 10721) 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting in any kind of trouble or anything with he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (7785/ 10721) 
yeah it was painful but no worse than going to the hospital and for my back surgery back surgery is really worse than a heart attack ever was 

Recording: (7786/ 10721) 
short north short north but um it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird um you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you got to access you do not get hit on my girls you get hit on my guys i dance with low sticks and i have had i had like seven guys come up to him and one night and they are just like can you like can you do that for me and 

Recording: (7787/ 10721) 
we buy amire and it is like it is just as good you know and you know we make do you know 

Recording: (7788/ 10721) 
and it is 

Recording: (7789/ 10721) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (7790/ 10721) 
yeah it is real it is like one of the closest fires and we go there because they have a huge patio and so you can just sit out and talk and and then uh we play a lot of board games lately to like we just bought access and out of that is me and my roommate 

Recording: (7791/ 10721) 
umhum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher i am supposed to get an hey what is wrong with you  that is wrong with you 

Recording: (7792/ 10721) 
so i am like 

Recording: (7793/ 10721) 
oh wow how would you hook up with that or is this you just happened 

Recording: (7794/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7795/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (7796/ 10721) 
really mad quick because they want that answer like that where you know i was a pilot so sometimes i am thinking you know 

Recording: (7797/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (7798/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (7799/ 10721) 
just because uh uh women have a medicine you know and probably because that was lacking in life um i could not focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman is voice in there but then some of the elders sat me down uh and the other thing about the swalloges men go in there in shorts women go in there in a long cotton dress you will hear people say you know and they are naked 

Recording: (7800/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (7801/ 10721) 
plus if they shoot somebody accidentally number one it is really hard to and secondly it probably will not kill them like a gun can um and you have to use your brain so i did not come from a hunting background um but my husband does work for the state high patrol so obviously i mean there are a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um in a lot of them 

Recording: (7802/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7803/ 10721)

Recording: (7807/ 10721) 
i think society uh today uh today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal well uh as opposed to being environment but back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there are bad whites too you know so

Recording: (7823/ 10721) 
oh long 

Recording: (7824/ 10721) 
i knew we i knew we would not go into this conversation too far before this before we came in  it is interesting coming from a small little rural area come from the city because people have a you know umhum yeah 

Recording: (7825/ 10721) 
they would never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of 

Recording: (7826/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7827/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7828/ 10721)

Recording: (7829/ 10721) 
you are the that united christian center that is right there on fifteenth avenue 

Recording: (7830/ 10721) 
but uh 

Recording: (7831/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7832/ 10721) 
i mean they will be a it seems to me they are more one liners so i am a little disappointed i am sad that the show is going off that that that the show is going to stop but i am not as sad because the in fact i am getting now with the simpsons i am having it being replaced by future drama which uh i find to be absolute genius and so it is not so bad x files i am sad but not as sad based on the past couple of scenes i mean these based nine miles the the air that one really bothered 

Recording: (7833/ 10721) 
in fact that that is always seen i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something money like that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the question 

Recording: (7834/ 10721) 
most of my friends 

Recording: (7835/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7836/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7837/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7838/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7839/ 10721) 
my husband is a lot better at these type of questions because he was methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his it is like well he is really are similar but yours is a lot looser than mine and  you know who is you know um just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and being there 

Recording: (7840/ 10721) 
well i believe that is where it was originally set up you know so 

Recording: (7841/ 10721) 
okay so our back gun is still there but ultimately as we get traffic uh measurements we will be able to down size the number of pipes we have so streamlining our net work 

Recording: (7842/ 10721) 
um i do not know i mean i i like florida just because it is not cold and it is it is really nice but it rains a lot i mean and i would rather live out west because it is like a dry heat as opposed to being i mean it is nice that it is ninety degrees but it is not nice this like ninety percent humidity i mean that is kind of that kind of but um it is just different to live in florida and how you think of florida being as real different like um i like it because kind of it is it is uh 

Recording: (7843/ 10721) 
i am sure uh 

Recording: (7844/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7845/ 10721) 
right so they do not come see me and i guess they should not care because i i would just like actually i would like them to come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have that is like everybody just want to show it off 

Recording: (7846/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7847/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with them 

Recording: (7848/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7849/ 10721) 
obviously i mean it is just something that just i mean you do not really appreciate it until you have gone through it 

Recording: (7850/ 10721) 
the city just cannot believe 

Recording: (7851/ 10721) 
right  right 

Recording: (7852/ 10721) 
try and feed eight children and if you are here in this country and eight children why do you have eight children to start with 

Recording: (7853/ 10721) 
yeah no no oh man i 

Recording: (7854/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (7855/ 10721) 
some places you are allowed to wear sandals and 

Recording: (7856/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7857/ 10721) 
and even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child the federal government still considered some half blood 

Recording: (7858/ 10721) 
and you are totally not doing it so i am trying to stick to that sorry um 

Recording: (7859/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7860/ 10721) 
it was very sudden and unexpected 

Recording: (7861/ 10721) 
and um i think they have a lot to do you know the parks and things like that so um i will just hold it  but i like it because it has art and elder and um it does not feel like a big city 

Recording: (7862/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7863/ 10721) 
i have no idea i remember where i was too when the colombine shooting because like my friends and i were sitting around drinking a few beers and you know we are channeled surfing and you know we see that kid fall out of window and we are like oh my god what is going on so we just left it on and it was quite like it was disturbing because i like i was recently out of high school myself and lake sherman where a fight but it was always like you could avoid them or you know what i mean 

Recording: (7864/ 10721) 
uh the little girl sitting there going well i mean you need to go help seven like seven nine times nine sixty three you know for time table and stuff you know so uh yeah she like younger kids with kids you know and think you know man you are just i mean you waste it you you you screwed up your life you are going to you are also screwed up your kids you know i was twenty miles thirty one when devon was born so 

Recording: (7865/ 10721) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids and for a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptoms or 

Recording: (7866/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7867/ 10721) 
he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure in a situation like that thing is gonna come up but we will we will deal with it 

Recording: (7868/ 10721) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am that i do not have a problem with it and i was in the men is league club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are you know that are that are gays well and that is and and i really made friends with a lot of them i guess i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not even though i am not one of 

Recording: (7869/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7870/ 10721) 
that was grade school 

Recording: (7871/ 10721) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be another thing above you know if there is that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (7872/ 10721) 
i got told you i can be an idiot 

Recording: (7873/ 10721) 
so if you pretty much have to be you know a camping middle class in new york you have to be a little bit rich or you are not 

Recording: (7874/ 10721) 
but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it is pretty easy i guess pretty straight forward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (7875/ 10721) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called grads and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids and 

Recording: (7876/ 10721) 
you know so you can get a look at them which is very for some respectful but you know there is some psychos out there i mean i mean there is some right here in town called remo eagle gave himself that name 

Recording: (7877/ 10721) 
well i was uh i was pretty well estably about responsibility and that sort of thing before i went into service that was the oldest son in a family of ten 

Recording: (7878/ 10721) 
oh yeah uhhuh it is the biggest thing 

Recording: (7879/ 10721) 
uh i can not i can not believe  he came back 

Recording: (7880/ 10721) 
i i think i think it is i think it is fair i think it should be that domestic partners should be should be covered i think there should probably be some um from some restrictions there should be some level of 

Recording: (7881/ 10721) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (7882/ 10721) 
that is the only way that i can get a raise over there where i work at 

Recording: (7883/ 10721) 
flowers and 

Recording: (7884/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7885/ 10721) 
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else i really do not understand that some people do it 

Recording: (7886/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7887/ 10721) 
uh i have friends that bow and arrow hunt i am not real big into hunting but at least they are they have to do something besides sit there and  

Recording: (7888/ 10721) 
because there is no fear being caught by the parents there is 

Recording: (7889/ 10721) 
in the 

Recording: (7890/ 10721) 
no nothing at all it it was known that he was the father like i said i mean he he was kind of uh some of those kids and i mean he did not listen to anyone or anything and he ended up like running away from home basically and like i said going out to colorado and like colleges drive down there there is car broke down as parents like wire them money for them to get a plane ticket to come back they ended up just taking the money fixing this car with it and kept on going 

Recording: (7891/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (7892/ 10721) 
not at all 

Recording: (7893/ 10721) 
they did 

Recording: (7894/ 10721) 
and the battle had fallen timbers here is my rough draft would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i will get a good grade see i i tell them i said that is what i am here for you know i am here to help you use me to help you get better grades use me to run interference if you think you know the science but you are getting marked down because you can not spell the words let me know i will go talk to your science teacher tell her not to count your spelling or not you know not to make you take the test 

Recording: (7895/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (7896/ 10721) 
i would been all but neither for him cool 

Recording: (7897/ 10721) 
that is right 

Recording: (7898/ 10721) 
i was born in los angeles california in the mid fifties and when i was less than one year old my family moved to columbus uh the first place we lived in columbus was in white hall near the corner of hamilton and uh then shortly after that we moved out to reynoldsburg and i i lived there until my sophomore year in high school and uh and during my sophomore year 

Recording: (7899/ 10721) 
i do not believe that 

Recording: (7900/ 10721) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (7901/ 10721) 
did not like it huh 

Recording: (7902/ 10721) 
she is addicted to t v something terrible and so of course her children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have have tv when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimates the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really goes you know and but there is a tremendous amount of violence and 

Recording: (7903/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (7904/ 10721) 
from the continentals i said continental that is what you call your guys from the states 

Recording: (7905/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7906/ 10721) 
i that is another thing that that we are i am in all this with my parents or that they do not understand the fact that why would i go to college i pay for it myself i work my way through school i was so proud of the fact that i was like only a quarter late of my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it as i went and and i did not have any loans i was when i was done it was paid for and so um of course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making you know fifty cents 

Recording: (7907/ 10721) 
right right right 

Recording: (7908/ 10721) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is right i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (7909/ 10721) 
yeah and just a couple things i remember when i first started going to the military and church up here on uh well when i was in sunday school we we drove there from reynoldsburg by going up to i think reynoldsburg new orleans road up to uh more is road and then over on more is road to high street so it was it was on the back roads you know  and that was before the mid sixties 

Recording: (7910/ 10721) 
i do i think they you know if you are open with your kids nowadays you have to be with everything that is in the world and my parents never talk to me about drugs or anything 

Recording: (7911/ 10721) 
yeah exactly exactly 

Recording: (7912/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (7913/ 10721) 
umhum yeah because i could not imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (7914/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7915/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (7916/ 10721) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (7917/ 10721) 
deplet to 

Recording: (7918/ 10721) 
sure 

Recording: (7919/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (7920/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7921/ 10721) 
yeah we take them to wind out lake or you know the zoo or all types of things well yeah we got them the best thing you got to get a membership to everything that is what we figured out uh we got the zoo and we got wind out lake and that way you can go whenever you want if an hour end of the show they are not participating properly you can leave and you you are not out anything you yeah yeah yeah that cosa is great we really like that that really 

Recording: (7922/ 10721) 
um the reason that it was one of the best years of my life it is it is an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to the paid in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers and uh i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions  some after 

Recording: (7923/ 10721) 
talk to them like you know this be nice then um 

Recording: (7924/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7925/ 10721) 
yeah but they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduced deductions it went down too yeah yeah and then again uh you say well you know like uh maybe some affluent uh person would donate in his publicize 

Recording: (7926/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7927/ 10721) 
yeah my brother is well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones that i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (7928/ 10721) 
but i want them to do that to me i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now yeah i think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and along with the politicians they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public and that what we think to make our ourselves look great 

Recording: (7929/ 10721) 
yeah it is a competitive type analysis 

Recording: (7930/ 10721) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference uh i can not say from what i have seen the people that went cathy schools um they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the medicine they have to do here 

Recording: (7931/ 10721) 
and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when i was about i think six years old i think and then they moved up uh to clintonville about when i was about eight and now my dad lives up in clintonville too so 

Recording: (7932/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (7933/ 10721) 
i think the news media have hyper up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba this says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba united states that is found to see us immediately turnby cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is that is the premise he is operating on uh you know in the news media they have not really been uh could you just have not been real objective about it i mean uh you know 

Recording: (7934/ 10721) 
well i said now i 

Recording: (7935/ 10721) 
i think columbus is really interesting how how it what develops compared to like i do not know just like how indianapolis like how columbus is different is uh a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and laid out compared to like philadelphia you know or it just be like when it was settled and when it was made and just how like where the streets are more or it is all like planned out more as opposed to like in in phillie or places like that more east coast it is like the roads part of them are real small and 

Recording: (7936/ 10721) 
and uh our our engineers not engineers per se but they are techies that are really into this they they enjoy their work and it is a four in the forefront front of a higher government along with the technology there has to always be the paperwork now i do not realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (7937/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7938/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7939/ 10721) 
well i lived on twelve maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but i was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couches being burned i said that is new 

Recording: (7940/ 10721) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they there is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but where the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (7941/ 10721) 
but yeah 

Recording: (7942/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7943/ 10721) 
but i think it should be an option you know i am really you know for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it is ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every it is been available especially when you are young no girls should have to go through you know pregnancy and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know 

Recording: (7944/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7945/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7946/ 10721) 
yeah and i think there is a whole bunch of people that just do not want to spend any extra money on anything you know we are already paying for enough of things you know i do that 

Recording: (7947/ 10721) 
um the first year they made it in state only um second the second class that they are gonna be starting to have some people from michigan i think 

Recording: (7948/ 10721) 
yeah real bad and and it was you know mainly um no one talked about it 

Recording: (7949/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (7950/ 10721) 
i can feed them and i get them so that is how our life is mister mom 

Recording: (7951/ 10721) 
well my question is who is more important in a basketball team the five stars or a six man coming off the bench i ask you who as george reeves is he more is he less important this year than he was last year 

Recording: (7952/ 10721) 
no i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (7953/ 10721) 
yeah so and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (7954/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7955/ 10721) 
it could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (7956/ 10721) 
yeah my favorite character on that show had always been chicole and i do not like how i do not like how his has been portrayed in in the recent couple of seasons um i like the fact that he was someone who had been a star fleet officer but because of a matter of principle uh left starpley join the mazda but was still uh fundamentally an uh an honest person 

Recording: (7957/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7958/ 10721) 
no uh what what really um what when aids started i had uh a one of my best friends a brother had died of it and that and that really after that i like you know was like i have to work on them because i was scared to death to get aids you know so i did work on them you know probably after a few years of having sex with outcome but 

Recording: (7959/ 10721) 
to be something that is going to make them change you know what is it you know what is it going to be and like how how is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than you know the government saying okay this is your cutoff limit but i mean the statistics they 

Recording: (7960/ 10721) 
well yeah me either 

Recording: (7961/ 10721) 
can be nice  

Recording: (7962/ 10721) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider their like urban 

Recording: (7963/ 10721) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (7964/ 10721) 
uh my main 

Recording: (7965/ 10721) 
see i am a i am a i am doing studies here and uh 

Recording: (7966/ 10721) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up with as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (7967/ 10721) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed on things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is uh basically is today as her future were back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i would not really think about today i mean i was thinking think about tomorrow 

Recording: (7968/ 10721) 
like i know it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (7969/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7970/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7971/ 10721) 
okay it does not have like the equalizer thing 

Recording: (7972/ 10721) 
all by yourself 

Recording: (7973/ 10721) 
i think i would say the same thing because um of course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i we learned a lot from her selflistness and uh 

Recording: (7974/ 10721) 
if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (7975/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (7976/ 10721) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (7977/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7978/ 10721) 
i wanted i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up picking up that child and coddling it and and having and having that maybe touch your skin uh and uh uh teaching uh what love is uh uh do you do not know i necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother or the little brother 

Recording: (7979/ 10721) 
oh i think that is good 

Recording: (7980/ 10721) 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you are going to tell me that fog pushed that two foot pine tree across the way i mean and there is a thick tree too  and uh we get up to the next gas station he fills up and listening on the intercom they had news on their weather and stuff tornado warning in that county i turned around i said now see who is the 

Recording: (7981/ 10721) 
i can see that uh you know like i said for me i kind of i kind of stay where i am so it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more so i mean it does not umhum that is bad i do not know maybe that is still guilty about that but 

Recording: (7982/ 10721) 
you know we will take that as an insulted 

Recording: (7983/ 10721) 
i do not even know what to say but it just grates  it is just embarrassing i get real 

Recording: (7984/ 10721) 
i think if it is a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which also been to of course 

Recording: (7985/ 10721) 
made to face their uh their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminal will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (7986/ 10721) 
no really i mean different cultures and everything uh uh i i went to school with black so i mean that was not that big a thing except for the in of the you know i did not even realize how many were being drafted or being the enlisting of the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (7987/ 10721) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were going to buy a house in clintville to hold them and rent them i do not have any money so i that down payment it has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bebble road for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl and she was going to rate him about she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so 

Recording: (7988/ 10721) 
well they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they um try to intervene with their family put them back with their family or uh um maybe calling children services and i and i just really do not think much children services so 

Recording: (7989/ 10721) 
and i mean yes they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact of matters it they are there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (7990/ 10721) 
to get them thinking about it and then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (7991/ 10721) 
the herbs  the herbs 

Recording: (7992/ 10721) 
no we just both having to work during 

Recording: (7993/ 10721) 
my roommate 

Recording: (7994/ 10721) 
well yeah it might be wrong but you know we we can not go backwards on that i do not think you can only work on your own 

Recording: (7995/ 10721) 
yeah course you know babies tend not to be on on time so 

Recording: (7996/ 10721) 
at nine thirty ten oclock here in columbus and that is so oh man i love going out clubing at like two oclock in the morning  um red zone red zone we usually they open up at nine or ten oclock depending on if they have got a special show coming in or not but that is the place i really like going um they uh there are open until usually two thirty two oclock all the time um i also found something fascinating um i uh 

Recording: (7997/ 10721) 
i can fire them because they are gay i can care less 

Recording: (7998/ 10721) 
see 

Recording: (7999/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8000/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8001/ 10721) 
yeah i have two other sisters  um one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced uh the five of us were all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on except for one she is divorced and she has not remarried and then my oldest i told you knacker and i guess she is not remarried 

Recording: (8002/ 10721)

Recording: (8007/ 10721) 
and we were like lanperable from probably oh two weeks after we met we just i have have not been without him so 

Recording: (8008/ 10721) 
 you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george straun nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome and all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is going to come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but uh to be 

Recording: (8009/ 10721) 
yeah we lived uh we moved about five or six years ago um and the house we had before was some big like eighty nine year old house

Recording: (8017/ 10721) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (8018/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8019/ 10721)

Recording: (8023/ 10721) 
uh because i would not allow to wear jeans i would not allow to wear tennis shoes 

Recording: (8024/ 10721)

uhhuh 

Recording: (8026/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8027/ 10721) 
period and it is that is a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way uh and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (8028/ 10721) 
oh i am sorry yes have you besides our time is probably up i do not know 

Recording: (8029/ 10721) 
well i mean we pay like forty or fifty here oh yeah well there is like you take federal and state and all that and i do not know

Recording: (8031/ 10721) 
okay so you are you are higher up there then i would be 

Recording: (8032/ 10721) 
yeah like i said i have parts no different 

Recording: (8033/ 10721) 
um  

Recording: (8034/ 10721) 
how would you do this to me  

Recording: (8035/ 10721) 
 yeah there is a lot we need to do a lot of the volving  we definitely do 

Recording: (8036/ 10721) 
does that mean 

Recording: (8037/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8038/ 10721) 
i did have a job like that when i worked full time 

Recording: (8039/ 10721) 
does your husband like that 

Recording: (8040/ 10721) 
yeah it it is it is difficult  

Recording: (8041/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8042/ 10721) 
the cowboys yeah yeah  

Recording: (8043/ 10721) 
subjective 

Recording: (8044/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8045/ 10721) 
and so it became a a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having and in fact maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereo typical um but i am sure it does have uh some influence because it i think it did it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces 

Recording: (8046/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8047/ 10721) 
um to move forward in my life now what happened what the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that work for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to and the stall are supposed to have installed those five feet higher three to five feet higher and uh should have would have could have you know if it 

Recording: (8048/ 10721) 
yeah well 

Recording: (8049/ 10721) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the dc that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain because we did or did not do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there were so many things to change and some of the one thing i can stand around this has not really been doing politics but 

Recording: (8050/ 10721) 
um like you said it would just be the old generations with the black president where now it would be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it i think that would be a bigger number 

Recording: (8051/ 10721) 
he is new if yeah  

Recording: (8052/ 10721) 
um well one of the things i am doing is i am applying for a number of research grants to go to germany and continue my research so hopefully i will get one of those um i think i am in pretty good shape to get one of those so uh that is that might cause me to put off grad school for a year but i do not think the grad school well my 

Recording: (8053/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8054/ 10721)

is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (8057/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8058/ 10721)

Recording: (8071/ 10721) 
um probably not  

Recording: (8072/ 10721) 
the hours with because usually we are starting the day too so it will probably work out pretty well for us 

Recording: (8073/ 10721) 
i do not think it is the cartoons because come on if they are that stupid you know what i mean they they should not even be out on the street i am sorry

eventually get kind of my own business where you know uh i have a want that i want to get a uh a spiritual book store you know and have uh things for everybody you know just come in and read them room broad you know read the stuff you know take time off to relax because i think most of the problems with stress is uh and i think people are are right in saying that we do not get enough exercise but uh but 

Recording: (8075/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8076/ 10721) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8077/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8078/ 10721) 
no it was predomin it was more black than white tell you truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i they live in a neighborhood where it is where not it is mostly black then white and that is where i have always lived in my whole life 

Recording: (8079/ 10721) 
he is just sitting there okay that is not normal and he comes home you are talking to him yeah it is not like you are here to talk to him 

Recording: (8080/ 10721)

Recording: (8081/ 10721) 
uh case western cleveland you are not far around here are you  

Recording: (8082/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8083/ 10721) 
when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and most the cops in the neighborhood knew i carried a gun 

Recording: (8084/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8085/ 10721) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but uh if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (8086/ 10721) 
oh i do not know do it increasingly like you know like like like do like like your recipes and then then kind of like work your way up 

Recording: (8087/ 10721) 
oh they were here there are many people that were bad eggs man 

Recording: (8088/ 10721) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and the education then i will you know then most of probably the people the 

Recording: (8089/ 10721) 
or board games or just anything that happens to appeal 

Recording: (8090/ 10721) 
yeah it is and it seems to me that they do not keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of the like just below the absolute best he keeps a lot of them here 

Recording: (8091/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8092/ 10721) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (8093/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8094/ 10721) 
um my sister had gone a couple times and basically took me aside and i have about one sibling and uh it is it is fun to have a sibling because nobody is more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with the unanimity that is your family 

Recording: (8095/ 10721) 
have it meeting the machines and  

Recording: (8096/ 10721) 
just walk in and start today or you know tell them hey you know the minute that strikes over i am gone and so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job so oh yeah three weeks a pay it is cost yeah it costs quite a bit of money but they got some strike pay and this and that but it was not a lot you know two hundred dollars a week is not much at all so and when you have a family and you i mean two hundred dollars a week does not pay my day care bill so so 

Recording: (8097/ 10721) 
take that away 

Recording: (8098/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8099/ 10721)

exactly 

Recording: (8102/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8103/ 10721)

Recording: (8108/ 10721) 
well i have met a lot more different cultures you know a lot more different people lived found out how lucky it was

Recording: (8116/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8117/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8118/ 10721)

Recording: (8119/ 10721) 
and they preceded to sit i think they said two over guns while the battery i mean the tires on fire 

Recording: (8120/ 10721) 
and you know she goes dad 

Recording: (8121/ 10721) 
just 

Recording: (8122/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8123/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8124/ 10721) 
well you always hear about the bb gun 

Recording: (8125/ 10721) 
yeah i  well that is fair maybe that is true too i mean i do not feel because you know when you are younger you think oh my god twenty seven i am so old you must be you know and now that you are here you will be i i have felt bad i do not feel like right not very responsible but i than that 

Recording: (8126/ 10721) 
in high school yeah i had friends with most of them 

Recording: (8127/ 10721) 
at the beginning he did perfectly but now he is doing this i want up at four oclock kind of thing and give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep and you know i do not want and i walk all the way down there is so many bottles worth it for a clock i can not see you fill in my way through the hallways and stuff 

Recording: (8128/ 10721) 
because it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (8129/ 10721) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the time i got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went out off my medication and uh you know blew it  you know so that was my responsibility and my fault but but uh you know how it was just uh years of penn up frustration and then just 

Recording: (8130/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8131/ 10721) 
so the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (8132/ 10721) 
so that i think that is a problem too you know everybody says well i do not want to get there at eight thirty you know so 

Recording: (8133/ 10721) 
right we are kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um yeah i you know i really really struggle with that because i come more from i think the families should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going to do that or out of the mentality to do that it seems like um  sounds like my dad these days these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids yeah 

Recording: (8134/ 10721) 
be really rude not helpful 

Recording: (8135/ 10721) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good day care because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before it was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or seventh in a church when it first started but and uh it is just not you know people are always saying i can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to 

Recording: (8136/ 10721) 
umhum  with all i have learned a lot it is been interesting i have liked my classes 

Recording: (8137/ 10721) 
once you are in it you are you have been in it and that is it i have thirty two points 

Recording: (8138/ 10721) 
it is a little bit much much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me just all the sorts of changes and things like that going on but other than that i mean i seem to like it i mean it is definitely changes for the better it is a lot more just for i mean to get to do whatever you on i mean there is no one watching every sandwich you have to do all the time and everything like that 

Recording: (8139/ 10721) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they will not allow dogs so  she is not allowed to go over there so she is always like but it does make a big difference i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8140/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8141/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8142/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8143/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8144/ 10721) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it it just there was nothing there there was no ability community there was a he needs some other piece of information at the same time there is no way i could tell it to him so yeah  it was like no so i am yeah you do not know and there was nothing else to do about it and continue on merely and he i he said eventually he said it was sometime later when i actually found out what was going on he said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count and figure out who is not there and assume something bad has happened but um but he said but it was a while before 

Recording: (8145/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8146/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8147/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8148/ 10721) 
for him to not make the honor roll every time i could not even imagine what was happening with him and now he is completely back on track and doing really well and my eighth great daughter is um she is and i get her involved in all kinds of different things she is real involved to see it her um she is everything that comes along you know she wins the science fair she gets the the power the pen she is on student count they all have lots of different kinds of things that they are involved in and that i am creditly proud of them because they are just 

Recording: (8149/ 10721) 
much in school is that 

Recording: (8150/ 10721) 
as to what the sanctuary should be like  so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour our choir director um arranged it to about six five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we like the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church they had three 

Recording: (8151/ 10721) 
yeah it is a good growing area the job prospects are a little scarce you know because the smaller town but yeah there is only about a one percent unemployment rate there 

Recording: (8152/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8153/ 10721) 
most of the trouble i have uh i got one neighbor that hates me and he is a share 

Recording: (8154/ 10721) 
no what 

Recording: (8155/ 10721) 
um like they are living together things like that 

Recording: (8156/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8157/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8158/ 10721) 
that is right well they do not they do not they do not give them uh i do not know maybe they give each one one free ticket or something  uhhuh 

Recording: (8159/ 10721) 
i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and their teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring the crowd where the kids i ask them i said do you i never go home so no oh yeah is not but they are always there they are not there just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are there after the they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy 

Recording: (8160/ 10721) 
that that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six other than much like a a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8161/ 10721) 
neither was i i really was not and uh it is funny i just this summer went to my twenty fifth uh high school reunion 

Recording: (8162/ 10721) 
how would you live up in ohio 

Recording: (8163/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8164/ 10721) 
yeah well dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being been um shown and and have access to 

Recording: (8165/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8166/ 10721) 
plus with the internet and everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (8167/ 10721) 
and she said well you have to take a foreign language you have to i said look i am not taking anymore foreign languages we are going to figure out how to avoid this or no you have to take a i said look like any of sixty thousand students in this university and if you think that i am going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the college of foreign language you are insane there is another way to do this experience what is it you have to take it for a language i said okay we are going to change the question a little bit here you have two options just tell me how do i have always taken it for a language or tell me how to talk to somebody who is not new because that is apparently all 

Recording: (8168/ 10721) 
oh yeah you just you just send that right all over with you do not want to time any people living in your house 

Recording: (8169/ 10721) 
not not um sort of an evil sense necessarily but just in sort of a a challenging sense consistently yes so there there was some sort of inherent communication break down grandmother is kind of a flake not that i am not a flake but we are flaking in different ways 

Recording: (8170/ 10721) 
that 

Recording: (8171/ 10721) 
in your address you did not even have to write it you just had to know how to say it in your phone number and um recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills and that was about all they expected do the play cooperatively um that is about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten they expect you to know all 

Recording: (8172/ 10721) 
for columbus 

Recording: (8173/ 10721) 
yeah i was the second generation of his because he was like he was like fifty seven years old when i was born so probably the last thing he really wanted was another kid you know 

Recording: (8174/ 10721) 
there is a tradition you see now you are looking you are looking for reasons that is looking for a science 

Recording: (8175/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8176/ 10721) 
uh it is i mean it is a lot better than it was even a year ago 

Recording: (8177/ 10721) 
so that was like through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that yeah 

Recording: (8178/ 10721) 
so i think 

Recording: (8179/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8180/ 10721) 
but it is just me you know i told i tried to tell her you know i am not in any kind of writing special program or anything like that my uh doctorates for damn sure driving an eighty five truck 

Recording: (8181/ 10721) 
yeah and um the the uh smaller house like bigger swiss chris are uh the older area 

Recording: (8182/ 10721) 
it is just like a miniature version of ohio state 

Recording: (8183/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (8184/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8185/ 10721) 
i mean i think they could try if their you know their kids try and push them away they should not you know let their kids push them away you know i guess you can not make your kid go out with you and do things 

Recording: (8186/ 10721) 
yeah exactly that is uh it is a very conservative town in 

Recording: (8187/ 10721) 
that would be great  but uh what i was most worried about was all the uh all the equipment and stuff those in the truck i mean there is a two thousand pound work with back there and you are not going to just dodge that  

Recording: (8188/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8189/ 10721) 
like i guess i can apply for um welfare and that 

Recording: (8190/ 10721) 
and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with phony wow i was as a as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just some i am not doing this as a there is just sort of something i am doing in the meantime until i decide whether i am going back to school or 

Recording: (8191/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8192/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (8193/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8194/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8195/ 10721) 
one of the hardest 

Recording: (8196/ 10721) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i i have only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go in elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but um i really think that if we let the always be more exposed to men earlier than they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girlie thing 

Recording: (8197/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (8198/ 10721) 
uh nothing for a while i do not want to do anything until past january you know because i have i like i said since nineteen seventy four i have never had thanksgiving christmas or new years off without having to work either a seven to three or a three to eleven you know and it is like i i figure i deserve this you know it is about time i get to not eat uh thanksgiving din dinner at ten thirty in the morning so i can go to go to work at noon or something you know or or open the christmas presents uh you know at five oclock in the afternoon because i 

Recording: (8199/ 10721) 
and they set the ammunition on fire they just set our gun position up pretty good and uh and that night finally they well i do not know exactly how we got a hold of back to our headquarters but anyway we did and so they sent uh tallurees which the the trucks which we moved to comes with out and uh we hit what was left remaining byebye 

Recording: (8200/ 10721) 
it is very difficult 

Recording: (8201/ 10721) 
he wanted to but uh 

Recording: (8202/ 10721) 
shand value but just the value of this is very important um because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want to smack him and he is being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and long behold a hour later or a week later or whatever long it takes i am in love with them again i mean really you know what i am saying and um i think it is just too 

Recording: (8203/ 10721) 
to make money on the side all through the government uh that is why i mean it is to easy to get away with stuff nowadays 

Recording: (8204/ 10721) 
um because there is some good athletes you look at colleges especially on the west coast like stanford i have a friend who is from california and 

Recording: (8205/ 10721) 
okay yeah he does 

Recording: (8206/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (8207/ 10721) 
every one is like you got to look it i am like well it is going to catch up just wait  

Recording: (8208/ 10721) 
well something that i i wanted to get into some kind of counseling with people that have been through traumatic experiences but i need to be at a point where you know i am in my recovery where i know i will not be sucked back down into their way of thinking um so it is it is a step by step process i i try to go into counseling for chemical addinctions you know for alcohol 

Recording: (8209/ 10721) 
talk to them or whatever you know uh i tell people they can go there it is the vpa vietnam veteran association so people do not even know about it you know 

Recording: (8210/ 10721) 
she was alleging that students were writing a racial slurs on their desks and stuff but i had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any 

Recording: (8211/ 10721) 
there seems to be an awful lot of publicized some of it i mean some of it is pretty dramatic a woman setting fire to somebody would have an income buying it is very dramatic but when it happened in collin by then it was all that was on the news for a whole day it would seem like you anywhere you looked that is where it was this thing was coming loose a little there uh i mean that is all you could see and it was like well how much do you how much new was there to say from minute to minute on every 

Recording: (8212/ 10721) 
she was a cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (8213/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8214/ 10721) 
i said why you know she goes uh why do not talk i will not talk to you but stuff like that i said why i am  you are dead you know for god is sake she goes well that is something that might talk to mom about but i would not talk to you but i said well that is cool but you know that is why i do not let you know that i do know women go through that stuff you know so 

Recording: (8215/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8216/ 10721) 
that is his full time job 

Recording: (8217/ 10721) 
two for country one for state or 

Recording: (8218/ 10721) 
yeah i i do not think he spends time with him like that you know he sees them at his mom is house and he you know will come by and see them at my house but i try to um put a i do not know because we seem to argue a lot you know and i do not like to see that so i try i try to do the best thing for my son 

Recording: (8219/ 10721) 
night with your bright lights on it and you are doing this that is about how good i am in those and she is just like you know and she is she is not a smart ass you know she does not show off but she is just so relaxed doing this and it is it looks so natural but she does not see that because you know you know she always thinks she is very uh mediocre and i go but you know i said you know you have been in front of television cameras and you do so well i said you get on the radio you do well i said you do well in school you have a ton of friends i said you have a great body 

Recording: (8220/ 10721) 
the direction is being put or they are being pushed 

Recording: (8221/ 10721) 
it is the art school 

Recording: (8222/ 10721) 
not directly but indirectly so i certainly did not want to be elected 

Recording: (8223/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (8224/ 10721) 
i do not wanna say are doomed but they are not even though they are out of that environment they are not doing any better 

Recording: (8225/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (8226/ 10721) 
right exactly it is and it is not it is my house is not is clean as i would like it to be but yeah but that is just one miner minor thing and i feel like i am just in a kind of a phase if you will it is 

Recording: (8227/ 10721) 
um personally no i do not think so 

Recording: (8228/ 10721) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtown i mean you you know it seems like you just drive through in the two minutes and so i do not think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so 

Recording: (8229/ 10721) 
biological experience 

Recording: (8230/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8231/ 10721) 
umhum they had one i was just heard in the news this morning they were talking about some guys like seventy seven years old for kenyon college or something the store uh 

Recording: (8232/ 10721) 
if you care that much about about keeping your keeping your own well  there is the kids ready to be adopted 

Recording: (8233/ 10721) 
um well i have lived in columbia all my life ever  can not say i ever really lived too often um i have a brother or sister uh obviously parents they divorced i live in the beach water area uh really is far as the high state goes i am a freshman here uh i started winter quarter um i like it for the most part 

Recording: (8234/ 10721) 
it almost would be better if they let the dog go over because you know she is going to bring in mud and grass and it is not going to be perfect maybe knock something over you know kind of start with her but you have to go home you know what i mean 

Recording: (8235/ 10721) 
she just margarines toward with their views of got or whatnot 

Recording: (8236/ 10721) 
but i do not know 

Recording: (8237/ 10721) 
and um so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church tacked on and we they  ask the choir for input 

Recording: (8238/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8239/ 10721) 
fire hazard 

Recording: (8240/ 10721) 
we do not you know we are getting impatient 

Recording: (8241/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (8242/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8243/ 10721) 
well um 

Recording: (8244/ 10721) 
and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it is like um my my oldest girl she we are expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks and and she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her and um it is not that these girls are not independent and can not do it on their they are megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was twelve i mean she is just very very 

Recording: (8245/ 10721) 
yeah and there is like a there is like a lot of kids who are who are different but just like not the majority or whatever 

Recording: (8246/ 10721) 
yeah yeah we live on summit street so we when i was younger we used my dad and i would buy our bikes down here and it was it is kind of i said i am gonna go to the university of hawaii but that never happened kind of stayed 

Recording: (8247/ 10721) 
i know it i know it but you know there there is um three three of the family three of the children have children and they each have two there is a a in each one the girl is the uh oldest and then the boy is a second and uh that is good though and i hope and i know my son who is married right now he is uh thirty one i know that he wants children very badly so so i should have probably ended 

Recording: (8248/ 10721) 
yeah they definitely have the steaks definitely the the big sticks are definitely on those two teams 

Recording: (8249/ 10721)

excuse me 

Recording: (8254/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8255/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (8257/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (8258/ 10721) 
i think my mother was okay with it all the conversations we had about since then we would be able to leave yes just did not dramatize her right i think it was kind of a no brander for her as well she is like ah yeah all your friends and your dad are all american experience that you do not know anything about and me talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair 

Recording: (8259/ 10721) 
you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (8260/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8261/ 10721) 
um i mean the fact of the matter is a lot of people out there i guess could be child molesters or whatever i mean it as it matter if they are straight or gay or whatever the fact of the matter is i mean they are they are out there 

Recording: (8262/ 10721) 
i am looking for a part time job as we speak i have been like doing temporary on and off as a thing with that is you can work you know for four or five months and then nothing and then like that so right now i am looking for something permanent 

Recording: (8263/ 10721)

Recording: (8264/ 10721) 
but they do not really pursue like the issues of being separated from home and two factions that had 

Recording: (8265/ 10721) 
yeah

Recording: (8295/ 10721) 
hard where that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country there is no excuse you know so basically you know it came down to after it came to a legal battle which was uh i was not going to back down they were uh i was poor monetarily and they knew that so they were using the legal system to wear me down um the first uh at the date of firing i mean

Recording: (8335/ 10721) 
yeah well she went with us last time and she liked some stuff but 

Recording: (8336/ 10721) 
boy i do not know i am thinking you know the the divorce people i know have had children and involved and um well it always seems to me by the time they get to that step it is already you know they have already been to counseling they have already tried a lot of other things and that their i do not know whether some kind of court ordered thinking about it 

Recording: (8337/ 10721) 
and that was strictly no no 

Recording: (8338/ 10721) 
they believe in him they power that that fear of him and power his existence when you got like minded people around you you know you can create a spirit 

Recording: (8339/ 10721) 
i teach a class on thursday nights um how to play with computers i uh play games on tuesday nights 

Recording: (8340/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (8341/ 10721) 
tv about it and everything that stuff been going on for years so 

Recording: (8342/ 10721) 
discovering america that was so deep and intense i could not believe what was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (8343/ 10721) 
yeah well i i asked the germans what the what stereotypes they like are prevalent in germany uh of americans and they said you know americans or cowboys and he did not mcdonald is three meals a day 

Recording: (8344/ 10721) 
saturday i think it was 

Recording: (8345/ 10721) 
and it is really unfortunate for the the workers in there because and the people at mary lake are so great 

Recording: (8346/ 10721) 
yeah but he is always um he is had like girl friends where he lived with them and he had a child and they lived together but he chewed on her 

Recording: (8347/ 10721) 
no he did not either he joined when he was sixteen and he was catholic before and similar just kind of thing with him just 

Recording: (8348/ 10721) 
i told him that he gets no guarantee that i will come back and in exchange i do not get health coverage while i am gone that is not quite a coincidence with him again i am talking about 

Recording: (8349/ 10721) 
yeah they do it is warm in the air 

Recording: (8350/ 10721) 
and you face the court as it may be well now we have passed so many little orders and laws and changed the enforcement policies and this kinds of thing where the poor police officer he can not even do that any longer he is got it is somebody it runs through a red light you almost have to hit somebody alrighty and then be accused for going through the red light now he can not justalbutarily be there because that is called oh i think the 

Recording: (8351/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8352/ 10721) 
i do not know i do not know if i could trust them you know 

Recording: (8353/ 10721) 
four or five 

Recording: (8354/ 10721) 
but you know with people coming back later and saying that uh you know you change your mind and stuff as the adopted parents i would be concerned about that but that it is not going to happen in this case i do not think and the because if her age in the six and there is sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so that you know they are talking to a social worker now 

Recording: (8355/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (8356/ 10721) 
in most in most area in most school districts it is comparable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher and or i think twenty six eight or something course worthington is one of the three highest paid districts in ohio um but used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or starting policeman and you know you in a sense you are 

Recording: (8357/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (8358/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8359/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8360/ 10721) 
you know go up on nature hikes and go fishing all that stuff just combine into one it is all about being in an individual and if those teachers can not study what that individual know what that individual wants young then older kids are not going i do not know what to do end up practicing well and not liking it going all that school for it 

Recording: (8361/ 10721) 
i am not really sure  yeah yeah yeah well i i like um i was i i have been very politically active at race times in my past and uh especially i guess in the late seventies and early eighties i was very active in um alternative energy fighting against nuclear power and uh have been active in 

Recording: (8362/ 10721) 
no we we uh i generally try to keep our child to their child to uh you know there is a time to grow up and there is a time to be a child and then uh we divorce when she gets years years old so i would get up every saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that you know and try not to let her watch some of the ones i but i did not like you know so and then on movies and stuff uh we would let her see some shoot them up movies and everything but the the weirdest movies she 

Recording: (8363/ 10721) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (8364/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8365/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8366/ 10721)

Recording: (8367/ 10721) 
um well if you have that bottle that for he will wake maybe up around six or seven i normally wake up at six anyway so it does not matter so i am ready umhum 

Recording: (8368/ 10721) 
uh and he went to columbus alternative which is considered one of the top high schools in the state and he was asked to leave uh he was in the psych ward for awhile uh in some ways he is seemed to have gotten it together um uh he is working full time at night at dairy farmers um he is involved with a uh very much involved with their having a baby in another month uh well not not really she is only sixteen 

Recording: (8369/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8370/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (8371/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8372/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8373/ 10721) 
yeah and you know i i would like to have another job but i would i would love i know you will say this is really stupid but i would love to have a monday through friday eight to five job never working another evening a saturday or sunday if if it can be now i know i will probably not be able to do that because i wish she wants me to come back there so as a contractor so i do not know you know so 

Recording: (8374/ 10721) 
well after graduating from state uh i have been here thirty some years and played now with the transmission department i started out in the finance area for the has not and then when the semester of the bill system occurred in the country uh i was drafted to head up and develop a uh communication section with an oldot and so currently uh uh i am i used to be a manager telecommunication so do not but now i am a special project coordinate for telecommunications so 

Recording: (8375/ 10721) 
it came up here and well so i mean it is just ridiculously cheaper here i did not want that after under that is just pathetic um my counselor just kind of found it and he had posted it and he especially um tried to by all the national merit people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other one is like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princeton right now 

Recording: (8376/ 10721) 
yeah yeah the no no desire yeah 

Recording: (8377/ 10721) 
and you know her parents were at the end of their hope she got pregnant and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know what more could she want you know was basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do whatever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they are almost rewarded 

Recording: (8378/ 10721) 
uhhuh but you meant she would never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party 

Recording: (8379/ 10721) 
umhum i doubt it  

Recording: (8380/ 10721) 
rather than the peers influence on him 

Recording: (8381/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8382/ 10721) 
um i am sure that it has because it enables a lot more people to get housing and and things like that um and i and you know growth has always good my husband is in construction so i should not be against it or anything but um you kind of like to have things spread out and kind of you know have some space so 

Recording: (8383/ 10721) 
uh well i am very much my my base line philosophy is though shelt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh being a vegetarian and uh um and uh most of our work i would have said no let us not do this yet although on the other hand i i have to admit that there has been some stuff that we have not been able 

Recording: (8384/ 10721) 
uhhuh that is good this 

Recording: (8385/ 10721) 
the things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and um his name was a station he he drives a lot 

Recording: (8386/ 10721) 
um i feel that the past season the past two seasons really have not been as strong as the earlier seasons and so in some ways i am you know i i i i am not as upset about the ex files thing that is run is i have been about other shows i mean it is also the simpsons final season i have heard 

Recording: (8387/ 10721) 
i do not think forcing prayer on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (8388/ 10721) 
i do not know yeah so it is kind of like i am for education in schools but um just like the bad things about uh you know sex can do you can get pregnant number one 

Recording: (8389/ 10721) 
yeah it uh you are right 

Recording: (8390/ 10721) 
yeah why not take advantage of this yeah why not take advantage of that so 

Recording: (8391/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (8392/ 10721) 
well i do not think he exaggerated but he uh he was selective about the penalty 

Recording: (8393/ 10721) 
uh the the accent sometimes but uh they they they are okay i mean no no big problem but uh the the accent sometimes it is like um a sort of a running joe kind of like you say this but it is like if i can talk like these and uh talk all the time like this why is it that they can not talk like we do you know it is like you know if i can if i could talk that because we do have pilots that you talk like 

Recording: (8394/ 10721) 
and like just through the first three hours i mean you do not really start to fill it and and then you really do and all that little pain that i did feel my mom is like oh tried doing it the whole time you know 

Recording: (8395/ 10721) 
but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of downtown um improvements i would just say keep i would just say umhum 

Recording: (8396/ 10721) 
umhum so i just had a a healthy rigorous conversation last night with 

Recording: (8397/ 10721)

Recording: (8398/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (8399/ 10721) 
you did i 

Recording: (8400/ 10721) 
the objectives in vietnam were never clearly tellingated 

Recording: (8401/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (8402/ 10721) 
you know so i do not know where to go to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that 

Recording: (8403/ 10721) 
yeah it can be a problem if you get hit 

Recording: (8404/ 10721)

which reminds me  

Recording: (8407/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8408/ 10721)

Recording: (8411/ 10721) 
umhum umhum except for a year and a half i lived in russia but  that is different

Recording: (8413/ 10721) 
you know which when you show it is a that are way of putting it um 

Recording: (8414/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (8416/ 10721) 
my first job over here at the oh issue main library was key punching 

Recording: (8417/ 10721) 
i think they do uh 

Recording: (8418/ 10721) 
but it is such a good idea did i go to our high state yes yes i told you that it is earlier though but it was not being recorded then so it is okay 

Recording: (8419/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8420/ 10721) 
yeah she is kind of well she has all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff but as far as the carpentry work we have um this one guy that is been doing stuff for our house for a long time or 

Recording: (8421/ 10721) 
and they have to become an active owner and they have to be taught how to participate 

Recording: (8422/ 10721) 
yeah he he uh was a a a great advocate of uh old woody you know so he probably learned quite a bit from the old general you know 

Recording: (8423/ 10721) 
oh i wish yeah i do it during summer too i usually work down here 

Recording: (8424/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8425/ 10721) 
a whole lot 

Recording: (8426/ 10721) 
and i realized that so it was like okay i am not going to do it for me but i am going to do it for the future and and that helped 

Recording: (8427/ 10721) 
no i just uh basically got out of a uh a relationship it was like a rebound type thing um i was in a relationship for like three years and um he was cheating on me and so i felt really bad why did you pick her and then i met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful 

Recording: (8428/ 10721) 
thirty on it and his report card he is got like a one point two five average so they take jelina who has an a him who has a d and they go well gee the average kid in the schools like see plus and they are stupid at the school columbus like schools do not do any good then you go to double and worthy do not restableville in order to get there you you are not going to be in his condition and you are not going to be stupid because you are trying to you know you probably but husband and wife work so the intelligence is there and you are not going to have dumb people 

Recording: (8429/ 10721) 
she read my notes and all that 

Recording: (8430/ 10721) 
i just did not see where it would be used utilize here

Recording: (8437/ 10721) 
oh i was very naive on that i mean i mean you see it on the news and you but the actual relationships and all but again do you need to know that unless it pertains to you and then even if it does pertain to you 

Recording: (8438/ 10721) 
right and and well and there is nothing wrong with that 

Recording: (8439/ 10721)

Recording: (8478/ 10721) 
so is that right 

Recording: (8479/ 10721) 
she does not so much mind anymore i mean since i have turned eighteen i mean ever since then it is been no problem or anything i mean she would sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (8480/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (8481/ 10721) 
oh the technology is changing i mean the web is really revolutionized what we are doing um well it is anybody can connect to the web

Recording: (8486/ 10721) 
they can wait until mine is crawling and or walk in and all that and he can take you to places and you know to carry them you can hold his hand

like sort of like chicken vitamins he gave me supplies of that even after the project was over but then after there was not anymore he could not give it to me cost too much for me to buy it 

Recording: (8488/ 10721) 
right right it is not an analyticalinical process it is analytical in the sense of controlling your mouth and and your hand and the bell and that kind of thing to get what you want to come out but it is not interlawed medical in terms of finger combinations so  not so much 

Recording: (8489/ 10721) 
well you have to 

Recording: (8490/ 10721) 
they will like why do not you pitch you know be happy for the indians i am like i am happy for them that is fine but 

Recording: (8491/ 10721) 
i guess that is what it is but i do not have a video camera either but i as soon as you said that i thought i could just see him you know uh 

Recording: (8492/ 10721) 
okay you just can not get away from a kid yet  

Recording: (8493/ 10721) 
well that is probably the rough right there 

Recording: (8494/ 10721) 
it is grace brother and christian middle school it is part of worthyton school it is because they an xt it is 

Recording: (8495/ 10721) 
well when you have formulas to make bombs and you know 

Recording: (8496/ 10721) 
nope i met him through a friend i met him through his brother was dating my best friend 

Recording: (8497/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8498/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (8499/ 10721) 
uh  

Recording: (8500/ 10721) 
that is all right  

Recording: (8501/ 10721) 
you mentioned earlier about like how this would affect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for for whatever than than i do about this this is kind of unfortunate but uh there i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really you know taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like 

Recording: (8502/ 10721) 
yeah i think it does but uh i like to exercise i think it is fun i would just do it four hours a day if i could do that although i have not for the last six weeks i have not and anything because it is just i have had these other things that are that are really pressing you know how that is you get you have some things you just have to get done and then when i get the stuff cleared out there will be a break and then i will be able to get back back to it 

Recording: (8503/ 10721) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (8504/ 10721) 
not like i am  

Recording: (8505/ 10721) 
um i went to let you see i applied to emerie harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those um they they were neat places 

Recording: (8506/ 10721) 
which i think george w is trying to do um uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell him i tell him yes and i am an uh an different and liberal 

Recording: (8507/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8508/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (8509/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8510/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (8511/ 10721) 
i think i did not know the difference so i did not affect me at all just they are just another person um i think more as i am being exposed to patients with the different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their care givers and what they need um i felt someone else equipped the first few times but um knowing what the expectations are especially like with brian card injury patients and when you go into sex reality and teaching them after injury 

Recording: (8512/ 10721) 
and you screwed something up 

Recording: (8513/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8514/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (8515/ 10721) 
would your phd come in oh 

Recording: (8516/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8517/ 10721) 
true that some of them had good things but they they are um they were not exactly hitting the market 

Recording: (8518/ 10721) 
because i tell her things like i said you know what you really need to do is like in the morning when you are all done dressing you look at the mirror and go i look pretty good today or when you have done something like say uh she huh he is in a play right now and when you come home at night you need to look at the mirror and go i did pretty good at the play today other people did well but i think i did the best i have done so far you know and and and it is not to make yourself an ego maniac it is just a you know that is like those little subtle hints 

Recording: (8519/ 10721) 
well you watch the movie  you are like 

Recording: (8520/ 10721) 
which is government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and um because already they have a bachelor is they will not pay for school no if i were stupid you know if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and did not even have my ged boy they would pay for my high school my college and everything you know even living expenses you know but 

Recording: (8521/ 10721) 
what is really weird is i go over my mom is neighborhoods and you will still see kids playing out there in the school yard playing baseball now i got a school yard right next to me you come up there and you see no kids doing it 

Recording: (8522/ 10721) 
then you get the shooting out in high onlyland the next day there is another one it is just kind of like that syndrome you know well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever um i mean i am not saying not to cover it but yeah and then course you have the whole gun can true stuff that is just ridiculous  

Recording: (8523/ 10721) 
right anybody but that bush 

Recording: (8524/ 10721) 
okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how to spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vegetables 

Recording: (8525/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8526/ 10721) 
oh man 

Recording: (8527/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8528/ 10721) 
but she is out there somewhere you know we do not have again we do not have clear evidence where she is and there are a couple of times where they where we thought we knew where samantha was uh i mean when there were all those clones of her uh i think that was in the second season or so um i think if i mean if they were going to end it they were going to have like three episodes in a row that just were tying up all these 

Recording: (8529/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8530/ 10721) 
and that was very stressful 

Recording: (8531/ 10721) 
it burned his his right now he got his hands up in front of his face so it did not burn his face but it burned his legs and his stomach 

Recording: (8532/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8533/ 10721) 
i mean the way i grew up is probably like back in the day like the catholics against the columbus publics you know like the richies against the poories that is how i kind of see but when i went to northland people are think northland is like a rich school but the way i see it no not really i mean we do live in a big you know house area you know the houses are like huge but um yeah 

Recording: (8534/ 10721) 
i  

Recording: (8535/ 10721) 
basically you know we used to be able to go to the woods and everything else now you do not even see marigolds on the playground so people would sue over it no offense people are ridiculous a bus 

Recording: (8536/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8537/ 10721) 
did he really 

Recording: (8538/ 10721) 
one of one of them set by the other one 

Recording: (8539/ 10721) 
okay so they it is just like an independent contractor for them 

Recording: (8540/ 10721) 
i will just keep them as friends  that works 

Recording: (8541/ 10721) 
yeah yeah like 

Recording: (8542/ 10721) 
yeah oh my uh i am in this uh venturing career which is through boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (8543/ 10721) 
um airspace industry my dad uh had a degree in um engineering uh oh what kind of engineering drafting engineering i think and um worked for in california and they asked them to move to the north american plant here in columbus out near the airport 

Recording: (8544/ 10721) 
on tennessee they are even friendly on some places 

Recording: (8545/ 10721) 
then so i give her most  credit for 

Recording: (8546/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8547/ 10721) 
we wanted to serve you um they they did not get that at all  they had like um  some people would just be like no no way it does not make sense  

Recording: (8548/ 10721) 
people i guess change over the years they are out looking on life changes or they are whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse within my they think about our generation so i think it is just a sign of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (8549/ 10721) 
but other ones you have to take the full major you know some people are doing uh gosh i think one is doing business and one is doing economics and 

Recording: (8550/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8551/ 10721) 
no that is one thing that i you know i have found was really lacking here uh for my son uh 

Recording: (8552/ 10721) 
i think it is been good i mean the economy has been very good um it seems like society seems to be even though we talked about this 

Recording: (8553/ 10721) 
yeah jay and i and i went together 

Recording: (8554/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8555/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8556/ 10721) 
yeah like a little kid and he he did not say anything to me but he made my aunt feel like a little pile of dirt a sister and uh so he just really showed out that day but what is so funny is our baby my that has red hair and our baby has red hair 

Recording: (8557/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (8558/ 10721) 
yeah umhum 

Recording: (8559/ 10721) 
needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit i mean i am trying to have myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little later you are a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (8560/ 10721) 
saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and uh they were not going to let me throw my life away like this well it was you know it was bizarre and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy i am never going to i am never going to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (8561/ 10721) 
i mean not say a few words for a plus thirty he would say anything get out of here 

Recording: (8562/ 10721) 
i get a job at at high park so that will i mean it is just amazing because the money is so good you know you really can not beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and what else um high park well it is uh it is a restaurant it is up in double a and so i do not know i mean i i did that all through high school and college and after i actually after i hm 

Recording: (8563/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (8564/ 10721) 
but  on the other hand it is not good to let your mind wander off i i find myself having to focus sometimes  have not to really umhum 

Recording: (8565/ 10721) 
yeah probably have to go to double under you know worthington somewhere around there to find couple millionaers but uh 

Recording: (8566/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (8567/ 10721) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8568/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8569/ 10721) 
it is like a mail order catalog thing and um so uh uh people are really really incompetent it is really funny like for some people um i do not know how they even some people who can not speak english even well enough i do not know how they got signed up or how that you would have a credit card order i mean and too you can tell especially when because people call from all over it is really funny to talk to people from alabama or south carolina i never knew people from south carolina had such stick accents i never really thought of 

Recording: (8570/ 10721) 
yeah uh i like baseball i used to like that a lot better when i was younger but no i do not i would not take the time to sit and watch the whole baseball game on the tv 

Recording: (8571/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (8572/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8573/ 10721) 
not doing anything this this order he would constantly be uh late for school and i uh called the school and told them this was in high school 

Recording: (8574/ 10721) 
bars and every once in a while there will be a fight and it it is still i mean it it it still is disturbing to me i i i i have a distinct different in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like are not making that distinction but i i do not think so and i think if if someone is not making that distinion it is i do not know that that they are not oh i i do not know i 

Recording: (8575/ 10721) 
get into school and they get violent and they they take it out you know and everybody is surprised you know i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and um and going to school it is going to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different backgrounds and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they they are not going to have one 

Recording: (8576/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (8577/ 10721) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice to and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you can out work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will be it is against yeah it is against the union contract so you had this 

Recording: (8578/ 10721) 
yeah i i think they are two faced 

Recording: (8579/ 10721) 
i mean he would have he would have been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there and uh while while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh oh i mean it was it is a hilarious story i mean thirty foot moving truck i am sleeping in it and i get uh 

Recording: (8580/ 10721) 
well one would one would hope that there would be enough uh education on the subject that the kids would not think it was that odd 

Recording: (8581/ 10721) 
yeah like that is just you are just killing your own citizens it is so ridiculous 

Recording: (8582/ 10721) 
uh i agree with everything he has said but uh i i am a little more i do not know what the right word is to say here  but sometimes i think politics they are a little bit dirty 

Recording: (8583/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8584/ 10721) 
group of five guys who know each other 

Recording: (8585/ 10721) 
but i love it 

Recording: (8586/ 10721) 
sounds like that is what i am from palo alto do not talk to me  you know you are not you are not you are not where they 

Recording: (8587/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8588/ 10721) 
yeah if i had um if i had stayed for the i i did not graduate so if i would stayed for the fourth year um when we did a lot we would do a lot of um uh uh making up a port fully of that kind of thing um i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i i would have i probably would have stayed but it was 

Recording: (8589/ 10721) 
they 

Recording: (8590/ 10721) 
um i first of all could not be a friend 

Recording: (8591/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8592/ 10721) 
that is uh 

Recording: (8593/ 10721) 
exactly but i do there there is the other side um that uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly your giving up your children and and and something has to be done but but there is also there is also that i mean i think it is a legitimate fear that children children of that group are going to you know going to be homogeneous out of out of their heritage 

Recording: (8594/ 10721) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before it just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (8595/ 10721) 
uh i kind of uh i i was like a rebel you know i did not really uh it was not really my cup of tea actually i had a pretty decent job i worked four and a half days a week uh basically and the uh electrical and mechanical type of things you know remove and replace what they do a lot now with cars um they put a thing on a machine and it says take that that i you know try it you know and you put that in and so it is it and a hind sight you know it was it was cool but but i had i like to 

Recording: (8596/ 10721) 
four five six seven eight nine ten just to get a volume level 

Recording: (8597/ 10721) 
and then you come here you know and i mean you see people stand out on the street corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (8598/ 10721) 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military you know as long as people do not know that they do not feel threatened see and and i i i do not understand that mind set i really do not i do not know why a a man feels threatened by having a gay near them uh i have a couple of gay friends and then one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know want to go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man is think that just because 

Recording: (8599/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8600/ 10721) 
yeah you just find it i can do anything i wanted yeah 

Recording: (8601/ 10721) 
and and it keeps you this confidence because very few people know about this 

Recording: (8602/ 10721) 
yeah but the same time everyday yeah 

Recording: (8603/ 10721) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (8604/ 10721) 
yeah yeah archbish or brumarro yeah an el salvador that is right umhum umhum that is right that is right yes so there are there are conservative and progressive wings although uh i have heard 

Recording: (8605/ 10721) 
i have been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up like herald and things like that um 

Recording: (8606/ 10721) 
basically last time i heard he was doing lawn care he is done about everything like i would told him you know get as many jobs as you can so you figure out what you what i do he is done uh maintenance work he is done uh sales work like i say he is doing lawn care now he is done uh gardening uh his girlfriend they live together he is not married like i said he is got a kid uh they have been together for about four years but uh 

Recording: (8607/ 10721) 
yeah that is interesting though because i think i think that that my whole i i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (8608/ 10721) 
for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be real interesting and help me feel like you know helping people uh they give uh new direction for abused uh wives and mothers and uh help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that 

Recording: (8609/ 10721) 
right down 

Recording: (8610/ 10721) 
can not i can not believe it at all i i you know i i i just blows my mind you can spend all thousands of dollars and have it just for a wedding 

Recording: (8611/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8612/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8613/ 10721) 
i think are i do not know i think it is a combination plus i think the uh i think the dressing is my sister is recipe for dressing and it is a the stomach bencher dressing with olive oil and garlic and it is just a real good dressing i tend to use that most times and everything being chilly just nicely chill and all that sort of thing 

Recording: (8614/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8615/ 10721) 
yeah i mean you know  signing oh here you go one  um the one i think is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that should not happen and the other one that yeah you just let us face it at that age and at every age we want to lead her um and i guess it goes back if we choose to or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we will make better decisions of who is going to leave 

Recording: (8616/ 10721) 
 whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bathroom and three fifteen or things like that 

Recording: (8617/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8618/ 10721) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know uh which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (8619/ 10721) 
i so um chris and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got in my head and i did not want anybody to say how is your dad doing and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call globally across the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go because how often do you get to tell people  so i i said hi how you doing ah no i have not talked to 

Recording: (8620/ 10721) 
i was like wow  i could not believe it

Recording: (8622/ 10721) 
stay on 

Recording: (8623/ 10721) 
right and then they wonder why uh you know uh i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way they will go the real thing do you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (8624/ 10721) 
 yeah yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the same up bringing through through mass media and and at well malls  

Recording: (8625/ 10721) 
oh i see well that would be a good way i would think 

Recording: (8626/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8627/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8628/ 10721)

Recording: (8703/ 10721) 
is that where you got married 

Recording: (8704/ 10721) 
i think i could summarize uh just with a few words of what you are meaning to say uh may be wrong but i think you are really meaning to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and there must recognize their children and uh do like you have just discussed uh do with them and and because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we 

Recording: (8705/ 10721)

wow 

Recording: (8715/ 10721) 
no sunlight you know and they do not give him they keep it warm and he is not allowed to sheets or raises or you know other than an electric raiser so he can not kill himself so you just just stock you there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just a agony in the and i think you would have to go and say and like there is really so much you i am not for board games or something but like you can not does not even hear human voice 

Recording: (8716/ 10721) 
ah for some reason i am supposed i am supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are always looking for reasons you are asking me i am looking for reasons but a lot of times it just happens why would you marry your husband why would you how would you meet your husband how would you come about how would you pass him into explain that to your all spring some day 

Recording: (8717/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8718/ 10721) 
well it was not i was in management for about thirteen fourteen years and it was not bad where i was before uh this management was it was the whole department it was uh i do not know what it was the people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole atmosphere like of that place and it was just people that i would known for years and gotten along well with were just they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just it was just not a good place to 

Recording: (8719/ 10721)

they she is you know half naked and she is she would be a center full somewhere you know and those are little yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it is really scary um but nobody is doing anything about it that i can see and they do not really see a concern but like i say wait till the generations start growing up wait till those little kids that we put all those things in their head grows up then they will think wow we should have done something i 

Recording: (8722/ 10721) 
i think i am i am perfectly good that 

Recording: (8723/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8724/ 10721) 
much tv um i do not buy these arguments that people make that say that like children are like like violence in tv is affecting children i mean i i have seen some evidence of of exercises where in schools the kids will watch a like a a violent cartoon like uh like road runner or something and then be a little ruffer but 

Recording: (8725/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (8726/ 10721) 
um transportation issue that was kind of a i thought that real system would kind of cool you know which is which is kind of tough the question is do we wanna spend the money on it and when people actually use it um i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you know like in a people driving both ways and i think if people are actually if they are going to make it so people are is it going to use it i think it would probably a pretty good thing to have and i i vote for it  i can not believe you are going to do that 

Recording: (8727/ 10721) 
because of your internal clock 

Recording: (8728/ 10721) 
popular bands 

Recording: (8729/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (8730/ 10721) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him 

Recording: (8731/ 10721) 
working with tools and fixing stuff so that is a come in handy that 

Recording: (8732/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8733/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8734/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8735/ 10721) 
yeah not not for special conditions nothing just universal it is wrong 

Recording: (8736/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8737/ 10721) 
my friend 

Recording: (8738/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (8739/ 10721) 
register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i could not vote until i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had a wait until i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that 

Recording: (8740/ 10721) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeah uhhuh umhum umhum umhum 

Recording: (8741/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8742/ 10721) 
uh this is the most senior year i am graduating in june 

Recording: (8743/ 10721) 
and teresa the foundation also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children 

Recording: (8744/ 10721) 
really see you would almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it certainly 

Recording: (8745/ 10721) 
 you know what is of course the guess that i heard was that uh uh the super in a new school said that if he was reelected she was going to resign and so they gave her a big raise  so she must be as hard in her side  

Recording: (8746/ 10721) 
and her husband works for a a uh testing company that does testing is uh i do not know very much of that  i probably should not even say but it all all true with or something or other older sound equipment 

Recording: (8747/ 10721) 
what we should buy yeah the retail what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (8748/ 10721) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory uh sexual harassment tapes and and and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel it is it is instituted as your uh uh harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crashes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crashes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (8749/ 10721) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of uh how much do you have to have of the to pass a law you know it could be something real real technical or something that a three year old could answer because it is trying to hit you know all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (8750/ 10721) 
you started sat down and say you know this is the only place i have ever worked with to move up stairs is in a promotion you know this 

Recording: (8751/ 10721) 
uh i went to a lot of them i went middle school i went to clinton and indianola high school i went to brookhaven and uh 

Recording: (8752/ 10721) 
because heck you know it is it is it is sitting here i mean i it is it is that is like a that is like a tourist place 

Recording: (8753/ 10721) 
for us  umhum 

Recording: (8754/ 10721) 
 i am thinking when the time comes we will just have to figure it out  

Recording: (8755/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8756/ 10721) 
people too like when people order bunch of crap i just want to tell them like no do not do that like 

Recording: (8757/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8758/ 10721) 
with their cycle and that is the way the indian people we have a many of the women refer to it is they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can not do that uh um there is just a lot there that uh you know women go through that purification every month so women 

Recording: (8759/ 10721) 
and uh and you know i was there three months before i got hit with a uh a race discrimination suit and but then i found out later this woman had in the twenty years she would been there had filed twenty suits so 

Recording: (8760/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8761/ 10721) 
not to happen and then she ended up getting transferred to to saint louis from here so there was something that really would not would not have been able to happened once you moved out there and that was in ninety so 

Recording: (8762/ 10721) 
well i mean as i mean like i was saying i he is at the ages where he needs to you know start learning things and she just does not do that i and that is probably the way she raised her kids but no we have totally different opinions about everything 

Recording: (8763/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8764/ 10721) 
have guns or anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they would talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early you know that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (8765/ 10721) 
it is more feasible than a six year old 

Recording: (8766/ 10721) 
because i had a lot of frustration build up  get a whole list there 

Recording: (8767/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8768/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8769/ 10721) 
yeah she is got she is got a lot of kids  there is um three boys and like four girls 

Recording: (8770/ 10721) 
then busting them to a half a day kindergarten and busting them to a day care that is near their school so we might as well do all day plenty of time they get a nap they you know they get fed and all that so been really happy with the day care there 

Recording: (8771/ 10721) 
it is it is it is uh it is kind of a oasis in the middle of the city 

Recording: (8772/ 10721) 
oh yes they are 

Recording: (8773/ 10721) 
yeah and then you can stay as long as you want you do not you know feel obligated and everybody just brings in food you know everybody brings their own stuff and it is fun i mean yeah it is from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it is just nonstop family everywhere so it is fun 

Recording: (8774/ 10721) 
very much so because there is two thousand undergraduates and basically eighteen hundred of them live on campus and then if you live off campus like i would like to think i do not have trouble maker friends but like the but i have had friends get arrested by the police because after ten thirty like the university there there is their vehicles they 

Recording: (8775/ 10721) 
yeah they gave us nine dollars a day like nine twenty five for what meal plan i was on so then um we bought like pop starts and that lasted for like a week of yeah 

Recording: (8776/ 10721) 
i mean you just never know how freaky

yeah 

Recording: (8778/ 10721) 
they are like you know small town living out in the country raising the kids you know the big house huge yard dog you know uh we keep looking and saying you know how is this different or better for the kids uh 

Recording: (8779/ 10721)

Recording: (8795/ 10721) 
which i mean is not necessarily a bad thing but i mean it is something that is definitely noticeable in there 

Recording: (8796/ 10721) 
i do not think that i would have him go to any  i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party that kind of stuff was a lot not more focus than i mean i did not even i do not think anybody even taught me how to write in cars so other than my parents so i mean it was it was interesting i mean it was a lot more uh kind of kinds of things you do a lot of things with nature and then they are kind of uh was the seventies too so i mean you have to look at the time what we are talking about but 

Recording: (8797/ 10721) 
they are pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i am not sure what the address is right now

Recording: (8806/ 10721) 
those poor suckers out there get stuck with credit ratings the banks making money we are making money they are losing now is that business ethics i ask you is it nothing is it proper business 

Recording: (8807/ 10721) 
i was going to then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then only very very opposite extreme uh extreme opposite we are talk about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and 

Recording: (8808/ 10721) 
i i do not i do not  

Recording: (8809/ 10721) 
 do you have it at three oclock 

Recording: (8810/ 10721)

Recording: (8811/ 10721) 
yeah it is uh had a little give him now 

Recording: (8812/ 10721) 
kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master the project i am working on now um it is trying to find a way to to to create data that describes web resources so the libraries can take this data and put it in a catalog and then agree it with a regular collection and we are doing a lot of with that yeah it is it is pretty it is a pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh job in the web give us opportunities to do things 

Recording: (8813/ 10721) 
i can not imagine not doing it that way i mean personally i i i do not know there is so much i know about him and things i trust because i have known him forever they are so many i do not think people are as honest and truthful these days i do not know i would have a hard time really getting into a relationship with somebody that i met today and not knowing everything about them 

Recording: (8814/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8815/ 10721) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (8816/ 10721) 
and then on a little bit there is another one other side of us 

Recording: (8817/ 10721) 
i should not be having to clean quite as much as i do now um i would say by ten they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themselves i know i did it ten and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house 

Recording: (8818/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8819/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8820/ 10721) 
um it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafia they do not get paid  

Recording: (8821/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8822/ 10721) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her uh but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring the subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are shrew about things and they should not be a shame because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (8823/ 10721) 
terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think they there should be any plea bargains and then the well but there are people who would get murdered uh instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can putting appeals thank you that is it 

Recording: (8824/ 10721) 
 huhuh 

Recording: (8825/ 10721)

Recording: (8833/ 10721) 
why is that 

Recording: (8834/ 10721) 
but yet they will not lay off people that actually need the jobs 

Recording: (8835/ 10721) 
um i really did not no 

Recording: (8836/ 10721)

Recording: (8849/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (8850/ 10721) 
well i think in general like let us say if you took a handful of executives from bordan or at&t or someplace like that you would probably in that in general they are very concerned 

Recording: (8851/ 10721) 
like 

Recording: (8852/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8853/ 10721)

Recording: (8859/ 10721) 
of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condoms on um which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurse office is one thing they are there you know they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating in that 

Recording: (8860/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (8861/ 10721) 
than highly critical of of organized religion

yeah 

Recording: (8865/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8866/ 10721)

Recording: (8867/ 10721) 
ten to fifteen minutes so yeah we stay pretty close with each other a lot 

Recording: (8868/ 10721) 
you are really smart no you are not dumb but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things and that they can not do and so then they say well my parents are just saying that because they love me i am really stupid you know and you have to actually show them when they get to be this age that look you have a hundred and seventeen iq

Recording: (8883/ 10721) 
makes and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (8884/ 10721) 
so like twice three times more price wise 

Recording: (8885/ 10721) 
that is just like a tone take everything you got that your real father got you 

Recording: (8886/ 10721) 
and i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it was pretty old and there were just things that he would do and i guess just picking up watching him seeing what he would do that is 

Recording: (8887/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (8888/ 10721) 
now i you know i feel like you do not have to go to church to believe in god and all that you know i talked to them i talked to my grandparents that are in heaven and stuff you know that is just what i was raised as and 

Recording: (8889/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8890/ 10721) 
this 

Recording: (8891/ 10721) 
yeah we yep you have to concentrate on what is important or just flies by and you do not even see it yeah 

Recording: (8892/ 10721) 
i have been back there for about ten ten years um i would like to move back down there but there just is not any work you know unless you own your own company so and that they easically is from all and drywall and stuff like that and 

Recording: (8893/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8894/ 10721) 
course my wife is worked in higher education for thirty years so 

Recording: (8895/ 10721) 
as a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status uh several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from uh but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union did that for a couple of years till i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts um did that that is kind of stressful um so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that and um 

Recording: (8896/ 10721) 
and they see the same thing as weird back to them because they are making christ images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what you go to bed night thinking what did we do positive day and build on the positive it may have been the smallest part of that she would paper 

Recording: (8897/ 10721) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we you know we knew a lot of stuff we were we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are going to regret this someday i said another ten years will be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either was my wife or i to be very independent uh i said it gets to the point that when we were first married it was hard to make a simple decision on anything you know we have worked through that after twenty five years but uh uh 

Recording: (8898/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (8899/ 10721) 
kept per morning and then all of a sudden about the nineties that came around and said hey you know what our our deficit is going another way we are we are going away i will watch on this thing as because we have been spending more because so much doing the same thing they have not learned that mom and dad remember mom and i only got a little piece of time as they did things no i am at the whole house completely for example of cars we do not talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty soon we are not going to be buying a houses we are leasing houses from the finance companies we will not be owning a 

Recording: (8900/ 10721) 
it is very informal here so i do not know what we were doing but 

Recording: (8901/ 10721) 
and i am not quite sure how to address that because in a in is and some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of both sides of your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you are believing capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (8902/ 10721) 
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in restin virginia so they did they are all married well three are married yeah 

Recording: (8903/ 10721)

Recording: (8906/ 10721) 
and then ohio and then i am going to own a time to see them go to ohio 

Recording: (8907/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8908/ 10721) 
talked about before but could not really do very well so it is pretty neat 

Recording: (8909/ 10721) 
and stuff but that does not get to express my creative side as much so it would be um my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people is well and like we do presentations at someone ours and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (8910/ 10721) 
um well because my cousins and uh they all have uh they are very you know oh educated and they are more affluent and i think that uh maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 

Recording: (8911/ 10721) 
um both times i stayed around this little town uh it is like northwest of munich so it was southern um most brooks 

Recording: (8912/ 10721)

Recording: (8914/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8915/ 10721)

Recording: (8916/ 10721) 
have you ever been there 

Recording: (8917/ 10721)

Recording: (8924/ 10721)

Recording: (8925/ 10721) 
oh yeah i would 

Recording: (8926/ 10721) 
i am just an operator right now i have done production work too for them 

Recording: (8927/ 10721)

Recording: (8928/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (8929/ 10721) 
who the therapist did it yeah 

Recording: (8930/ 10721) 
businessmen my dad and i have been screwing around with stock for years um i have been in contact with a um day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know but if that if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia uh they are in richmond west virginia now richmond yeah i have been saying west virginia have i they are in virginia sorry they are they are home bases in uh richmond virginia 

Recording: (8931/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah but but but many people especially the kid that young may not know what that really means and may it is to be part of the group and part of the you know be cool may go along with it when really they do not like it i do not i have not made up my mind about him whether he is telling the truth or whether he has not or whether they it was not 

Recording: (8932/ 10721) 
the day i left the hospital he was running around with him and he 

Recording: (8933/ 10721) 
the big boys get all the breaks so uh in my opinion the judge did not want to hear the case before then or maybe as dock it was full but i am saying you know there is no priorization in the legal system there are some things that uh should be addressed soon uh should not after to wait that long but so then came down to one week prior to the uh hearing 

Recording: (8934/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8935/ 10721) 
we want a dog and we have kind of been waiting um but i like both animals 

Recording: (8936/ 10721) 
because the larger story was too much to film in one one movie but this one as a as a as a part of a whole i i am preserving until 

Recording: (8937/ 10721) 
i think 

Recording: (8938/ 10721) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education they 

Recording: (8939/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8940/ 10721) 
an urban area 

Recording: (8941/ 10721) 
but even though you are not responsible i am not supposed to be responsible uh people you know that have the beer party in a house yeah they they should be held responsible to some degree but we are in a society that loves to sue people 

Recording: (8942/ 10721) 
um my parents are all for it they have always been supportive of whatever we wanted 

Recording: (8943/ 10721) 
like you know you can get together by uh pretty much in an apartment and the whole you know floor you know you can come friends with everybody go fast so i am hoping that is the same deal and i travel it is like it is easy to like friends and hook up and you know say oh you have got a job you know and it was like you know hook me up 

Recording: (8944/ 10721) 
and i i have an office within the within the um program now and yeah and it is just incredible how much i have learned i think i learn more in that program than i do in all my classes put together 

Recording: (8945/ 10721) 
for example so you should name her camer 

Recording: (8946/ 10721) 
get something approved through all the parameters you got to go through and everything and then they start working on it and then they get it done so i tend fifteen years old 

Recording: (8947/ 10721) 
can i just say yes  i like watching stuff um i like games 

Recording: (8948/ 10721) 
they keep me from moving up in the company with a pair of scissors 

Recording: (8949/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8950/ 10721) 
i play with computers um normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day or what i did the day before so they asked me anything here so um what did i do today what i did today internet information servers a product by microsoft it lets you house went pages and put the model on the way i have index services another product that lets you put searches on that um then there is another product by a company called it is like a called net stock it is uhhuh net stock 

Recording: (8951/ 10721) 
and it it is you know my mom you know she always says well what you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (8952/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (8953/ 10721) 
well yeah in a case like that the parents should know i mean because there is something going on 

Recording: (8954/ 10721) 
saying that if you have a fourth or half 

Recording: (8955/ 10721) 
but uh 

Recording: (8956/ 10721) 
i mean obviously being being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing the even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something and he thought that it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8957/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (8958/ 10721)

Recording: (8959/ 10721) 
i my my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the other frame and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it is reached the point that the decision is made and announced and there were good reasons for it uh and they explain the reasons and you know at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something 

Recording: (8960/ 10721) 
usually every weekend 

Recording: (8961/ 10721) 
every kid and my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or another

Recording: (8974/ 10721) 
uh well it is not their spring or whatever it is they sell uh for ten thousand dollars a piece and bm planted another so they take and produce a quote beautiful oh a beautiful child uh and if you are talking about just the physical features it it is meaningful it is what is embodied in that body that is can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is abhorent 

Recording: (8975/ 10721) 
so they spent all these thousands of dollars on the airfare and they are still they are still coming out ahead mannish gets to one of those las vegas chapel weddings and things that i could drive through and you know they really want to do do it on the cheap you know and they have like elvis as your as the as a from the south here am i that is crazy

Recording: (8982/ 10721) 
um but you know i think what they did was fairly good they did not really as far as i remember at that point at least they did not well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue um but i what i remember was more of a scientific approach 

Recording: (8983/ 10721)

Recording: (9001/ 10721) 
uhhuh uhhuh  

Recording: (9002/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9003/ 10721)

Recording: (9005/ 10721) 
wow you yeah i know 

Recording: (9006/ 10721) 
me too 

Recording: (9007/ 10721)

Recording: (9008/ 10721) 
i am i have always lived in ohio so i am a native ohio and southern ohio umhum right now i am staying at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five year old and uh my profession and as a nurse i am yeah but i have been taking a little while off since i have had the baby  umhum yeah well 

Recording: (9009/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9010/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and 

Recording: (9011/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (9012/ 10721) 
there is some kind of tax program 

Recording: (9013/ 10721) 
you can get in huge arguments people like no you are lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them to die and honestly i can honestly say i would not want that to happen to them 

Recording: (9014/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9015/ 10721) 
when he died um i was about thirty 

Recording: (9016/ 10721) 
toward society now we we we bought to 

Recording: (9017/ 10721) 
now if i shoot you then might do something i do not get me right but i mean if i shoot you then might do something but otherwise in that day i am going to do nothing 

Recording: (9018/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9019/ 10721) 
 say  

Recording: (9020/ 10721) 
i am a spanish major 

Recording: (9021/ 10721) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (9022/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9023/ 10721) 
well i work i work parttime kind of because uh i worked full time when he was you know one and i did not know i felt like uh um the babysitters or you know whoever saw him more than i did and that because i love my son more than anything in the world and i felt like he needed me you know so i went down a part time i am struggling more but i rather see my son have me you know 

Recording: (9024/ 10721) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good i my my best friend is a realtor and she is since retired but it is so funny because she would always go through all these statistics and this and that because the stuff i have done is in and and because i live in the area and so she would say oh i do not know and she would say well how much do you have to get it for and how much and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can sell for a hundred and forty if i did the system now you are gonna put a lot of money into that though it is not like you are you are still only getting 

Recording: (9025/ 10721) 
well it is this it is like corporation like i do not know it is just this like kind of it is generic catalog thing i do not i do not know like like shoppers advantage uh has some in there thing with it too um but 

Recording: (9026/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9027/ 10721) 
gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (9028/ 10721) 
uh that is nice 

Recording: (9029/ 10721) 
uh i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know well 

Recording: (9030/ 10721) 
well because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be first to know that there is a lot of favor to them you know some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other 

Recording: (9031/ 10721) 
the arts was called  and that was interesting it was those are it is kind of an underclass of teachers they do not pay you know enough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hour and and my humph street class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty 

Recording: (9032/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9033/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9034/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (9035/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9036/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9037/ 10721) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like what do they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give an example i did not grew up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears bar caps and listens to 

Recording: (9038/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9039/ 10721) 
yeah but um some names are just like oh we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not never expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother is name was harryette 

Recording: (9040/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9041/ 10721) 
yes but there is nobody home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured something weird is going on i did not know what was going on but at the same time it was all the worst they did not just basically dumb because the divorce was not going to phase me because the entire marriage was we knew we knew from the beginning that it was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of an evident one so we are just kind of waiting around going oh i am going to be there for you for a couple of months and sure enough so anyway um so i i look at these people and their names are the 

Recording: (9042/ 10721) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people or the pets say but it is just i could not me around that and uh you know i would go off on people that would do that bring it in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth sometimes uh i am not a violent man either even as big as i am you know so 

Recording: (9043/ 10721) 
 yeah yeah 

Recording: (9044/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9045/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9046/ 10721) 
um i do some much just not one of them i just got back from lunch with i mean i see them 

Recording: (9047/ 10721) 
where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that someone segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not giving out equal opportunity of the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing what people are doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (9048/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9049/ 10721) 
right yeah you well you can not even put a price on it either so it is 

Recording: (9050/ 10721) 
in a hole and i was still uh sick uh but uh and i do not remember i think they put one of our guns out of commission that time but they did not do that much damage as they might have 

Recording: (9051/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9052/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9053/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9054/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9055/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9056/ 10721) 
where it is more coherent but then the catholic school is like seems to be very clear they are all going in the same direction and working as a team uh i do not know have you ever listened to any of the uh clint was board of education meetings there on the radio 

Recording: (9057/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9058/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9059/ 10721) 
because see i am a stepfather 

Recording: (9060/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9061/ 10721) 
that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars 

Recording: (9062/ 10721) 
yeah he is a father 

Recording: (9063/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9064/ 10721) 
i wish i could work on tax 

Recording: (9065/ 10721) 
i i never liked to meet my parents always made me eat it once i went away to college and i said i am i am not going to eat anything more and they are like oh well we will see and i have never eaten anything since yeah 

Recording: (9066/ 10721) 
no no in fact the principal when she interviewed me asked me that and i said when we were raised in the unitary and sunday school it is a it is almost an indoctrination and tolerance for other religions  so you are better off with me than somebody that believes there is is the only one true umhum 

Recording: (9067/ 10721) 
i i just hope she adjusted 

Recording: (9068/ 10721) 
they say 

Recording: (9069/ 10721) 
yeah do not bother me a little bit 

Recording: (9070/ 10721) 
right yep but uh fifty dollars a week 

Recording: (9071/ 10721) 
i mean actually run over and killed 

Recording: (9072/ 10721) 
then see our paper so when you write on the white copy it comes to onto the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend so he he did not have to write you know if he was not getting the notes 

Recording: (9073/ 10721) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (9074/ 10721) 
to all of the stuff and then you you know pretend that you are a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case and going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me i would say my family my mom and dad um well i uh my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungary and that was a neat experience i like growing not talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant and hungry uh and he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do 

Recording: (9075/ 10721) 
value and why are you doing this to my kid uh so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools uh so there just seems to be more destruction for the educational process i mean when you are in the catholic school and you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to course part of the way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it 

Recording: (9076/ 10721) 
you know so unfortunately you know i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressures put on schools and education now 

Recording: (9077/ 10721) 
and i was not real more i was more surprised that they find a lot of like alcohol like i would not like you know like some people if they do drugs at school and stuff i am not saying that is right but they will they will do it but like alcohol it would be so hard they will like hi because it smells you know and you got to hold it out but they find like bottles of liquor and 

Recording: (9078/ 10721) 
ah four twenty five 

Recording: (9079/ 10721) 
this things are hers 

Recording: (9080/ 10721) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out and just come came back a couple months ago um my grandfather just passed away but he was here and then her husband home for about a year 

Recording: (9081/ 10721) 
well see my my husband would do that the it is not bizarre because it is i do not know what i i absolutely do not i think that is where his brain is completely lacking i think i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says not a good judge of that you will have to check but because my my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his ski boarding friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on i said 

Recording: (9082/ 10721) 
in the dorms too and i really did not like that like it was like i do not know it was like living in a hotel or something that was really weird and like 

Recording: (9083/ 10721) 
i have sex umhum 

Recording: (9084/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9085/ 10721) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (9086/ 10721) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about um as as far as like your student loans and being able to get into  just help me and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy think i think i have gone pretty recently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i 

Recording: (9087/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9088/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9089/ 10721) 
that will come later maybe when i retire way 

Recording: (9090/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9091/ 10721) 
do you really 

Recording: (9092/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9093/ 10721) 
no i i i would not i am not saying i am to account at the public school but uh an alternative school i will send them to um i am at school i do not i would if i had the money to use it sure as i would that is definitely but i know i could not afford it that is why i am never thought about it really 

Recording: (9094/ 10721) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (9095/ 10721) 
you know but they did not seem to have grown up in this you know terrible environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think a lot more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i 

Recording: (9096/ 10721) 
deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living and working to yeah different people with different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denomination of humans but it it approached that from a less um uh from a more realistic standpoint instead of having like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come 

Recording: (9097/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9098/ 10721) 
um as far as being homosexual so i mean i really can not say that i would say that to affecting the kids 

Recording: (9099/ 10721) 
and i think that that is one of the things that can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence a lot of kids is taking over their lives if it is not that now it is it is worse yet it is the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you can walk in and sit and turn it off and you can go in i guess and to see what they are on the internet on the internet anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program 

Recording: (9100/ 10721) 
she did go and she she uh uh a psychologist psychologist in child psychology or something and it and it was she was real good about the divorce theater that she was true to cause them 

Recording: (9101/ 10721)

Recording: (9102/ 10721) 
walked out and i it was not quietly and i  but it felt good and and i did not even know if i was going to be living in the streets but i will never forget the day you know and his wife worked in the office too so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i am going home you know he can reach me at home and then he was shocked and he just could not believe it he said you can not do this he says i will not pay you and i said you know watch me walk out the door and i do not want any money you know so i left out um 

Recording: (9103/ 10721) 
and we could do what we wanted  

Recording: (9104/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (9105/ 10721)

Recording: (9106/ 10721) 
and i have been in a house and 

Recording: (9107/ 10721)

Recording: (9108/ 10721) 
i know i was thinking that you were when you were telling me this stuff 

Recording: (9109/ 10721) 
yeah it got boring it got frustrating because we uh you get these new people moving in and you know you are used to everything being nice you know and then get people next door breaking into your upstairs from you breaking into each just 

Recording: (9110/ 10721)

Recording: (9126/ 10721) 
just you know 

Recording: (9127/ 10721) 
so that is the reason i had to quit it was like if i could leave the situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself i would have been okay but that was not how it worked so i had to to pull back from it  

Recording: (9128/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9129/ 10721) 
i mean not saying that they had to believe what we believe but just even just their attitude about life was so down and 

Recording: (9130/ 10721) 
yeah it is great you know and they like it they sing us on and you know interact with other kids and learn to use the library you know nowadays you know people do not go to the library as much either wanting to get your information off the internet or you buy books or you know it you know so i just we have felt that if we and introduce them now that hopefully this will lead on later and this way you can monitor their television we let them rent 

Recording: (9131/ 10721)

Recording: (9136/ 10721) 
i honestly do not think that that really has much to do with it obviously it does put the idea in the kids heads but it is been there for a long time 

Recording: (9137/ 10721)

Recording: (9141/ 10721) 
are you did not 

Recording: (9142/ 10721) 
it is my deal idea is about it so i am i figured something i should know about so  

Recording: (9143/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9144/ 10721) 
and i do not know whether they are going to be able to treat these jeans back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherited over here but if you have adopted to the child you can go back and you can find out how the child better 

Recording: (9145/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9146/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9147/ 10721)

Recording: (9148/ 10721) 
yeah anger it is always anger 

Recording: (9149/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9150/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9151/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9152/ 10721) 
my mom 

Recording: (9153/ 10721) 
your later uhhuh 

Recording: (9154/ 10721) 
i believe 

Recording: (9155/ 10721) 
a little bit faster uh but and and then when i get out of the service i get twenty two you know it is kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleaning a house the next gal you know some well that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (9156/ 10721) 
i think it if god meant me to i i think it is wrong for them to be using that in into into a vertical fertilization i think they call introver is i can not to say the right thing what is it  

Recording: (9157/ 10721) 
right out like 

Recording: (9158/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9159/ 10721) 
and that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a die on it you may put a different um whatever those i pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that is just cosmetics and anyone who tries to change your sexual orientation that is cosmetics too uh and again uh my belief is whatever happens between consent adults is their business not mine um yeah 

Recording: (9160/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9161/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9162/ 10721) 
they do because he just he is all out for himself 

Recording: (9163/ 10721) 
 you played saxophone in the band 

Recording: (9164/ 10721) 
yeah i have been through i did not really know anything heart attack ate too much that good stuff 

Recording: (9165/ 10721) 
we have not been there in a while but i mean we do go 

Recording: (9166/ 10721) 
so that is you know they a lot of my decisions were based upon that 

Recording: (9167/ 10721) 
um i mean at that point i i certainly did not have any real knowledge about any of that sort of thing um you know they covered the basics um they did talk about condoms and um contraceptions i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed by um i mean i do not really uh they i 

Recording: (9168/ 10721) 
i listen to someone i just touch someone who will be successful you will be successful individual and that is what is most critical you yourself has to do it not the business because from you businesses observe 

Recording: (9169/ 10721) 
and we know that the result could be death then like and it and it is in the grass in the grass and think one side will be the grass or one would obviously because you can not have two uh to aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in its response you can not you know what i mean so it like the state of war that was like that so in that contact i think but like in the same contact i feel that it would be wrong for a soldier to 

Recording: (9170/ 10721) 
some of the ordinary people we are both into genealogy on our perspective families and you can find a lot out of our families and you start going to in fact you may you forgot one that i found i had do not you remember and that their library in pennsylvania and i he came back when i sit there laughing i am trying to laugh out loud and he said what so funny uh all the names i am looking for from all my family he is 

Recording: (9171/ 10721) 
county yeah but everybody does everything in man isfield because there is nothing to do in ashland but uh the man isfield well growing up in mansfield it was um uh it was really boring it was really boring um my dad was 

Recording: (9172/ 10721) 
because there is some people that actually can not work 

Recording: (9173/ 10721) 
do you mean 

Recording: (9174/ 10721) 
that is 

Recording: (9175/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (9176/ 10721) 
we just agreed to get divorced he went to he you know i did not even see the lawyer he just brought the papers for me to sign and 

Recording: (9177/ 10721) 
i am come home and get in the car and go out go somewhere you know or come home and get something to eat and you know but and it uh but i think that has a lot to do with it uh i do not really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid watching how do you do these and all that stuff and course it was not the uh buying the stuff maybe you can see on tv now or uh but i do not really think the media is has had that much to do with it 

Recording: (9178/ 10721) 
all this other stuff 

Recording: (9179/ 10721) 
connecting from wires across up here or something and they are uh so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (9180/ 10721) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emily in the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get the actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (9181/ 10721) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposely tried to work clothes or do the back roads it is nice from here you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on backwards so it is not that bad 

Recording: (9182/ 10721) 
we did not know you know anything about what he did or we found out more um after he died 

Recording: (9183/ 10721) 
it would be like go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (9184/ 10721) 
not these people would well no some of these people would know what he may is but probably only one or two out of the like six 

Recording: (9185/ 10721) 
so it was hard to talk to drug people  

Recording: (9186/ 10721) 
um i just think it is uh horribly biased paper they do not really take their uh what is that uh the journalistic like unbiased integrity do not take that seriously 

Recording: (9187/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9188/ 10721) 
um i know that is a lot easier said than done because you fall in love every other week sometimes when you are young um but i do not think it encourages it i just think in you know they she has so much on tv it is all you know people are newed on at ten oclock at night on these shows and these girls are watching it i mean great and most of them are adults but on the soap operas and stuff it is a different story so they are seeing it anyways uh you just i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say 

Recording: (9189/ 10721) 
i had high potential when i had the first two and then uh the last two i had now i got cardiovascular disease i still got one of murderers about eighty percent blocked i got another one fifty percent block and i got a dead spot on my heart right now so when i exercise uh my heart slows down let us put it this way where i work at i work here at osu yeah well 

Recording: (9190/ 10721) 
um the my sister was here only 

Recording: (9191/ 10721) 
no i never did i i do not know of any people that do but but it was also for me i think if i know something is true i i just know it and then as long as it keeps on being true over and over again if it is not just some exciting thing that for one day it is like oh this is great but like six months later it still has the same still ringing true and a year later two years later than that type of thing 

Recording: (9192/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9193/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (9194/ 10721) 
um when i went i went with my friend 

Recording: (9195/ 10721) 
is it really 

Recording: (9196/ 10721) 
yeah they do not pay you for any of that stuff  

Recording: (9197/ 10721) 
where that nice mall is and um someone smith which is outside of atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff 

Recording: (9198/ 10721) 
uhhuh i moved just to vis moved into uh uh up by one sixty one cleveland area uh i lived up there for years but i just moved back up or and and uh why i left it was because of the the city the traffic and everything where you get around campus you know it is a lot i mean it is all but down here even with the kids and everything going to school but basically it is kind of laid back uh 

Recording: (9199/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (9200/ 10721) 
that uh greg and vice kids do you said this is all continental but you know 

Recording: (9201/ 10721) 
um i go to north when i school right now 

Recording: (9202/ 10721) 
but it is fun 

Recording: (9203/ 10721) 
and i hand it in my uh in other ones it is it is a struggle with that thing and understanding it takes time to understand it a lot of people a lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it um i was trying to let the fear of that um though i am not afraid to die i am afraid sometimes that i will die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was sitting here to do which is just the basic things 

Recording: (9204/ 10721) 
they ai not going to lock me up 

Recording: (9205/ 10721) 
oh the the the video tapes that i did not like there was not a class that was the class was kind of goofy but um it was that and watching the situation the tryers was trying to i am not no 

Recording: (9206/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9207/ 10721) 
yeah it basically feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes but exorbitantly high i mean it is a little higher but you know it it is not hum 

Recording: (9208/ 10721) 
what you did 

Recording: (9209/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9210/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9211/ 10721) 
so when i got home way we were married and she had family out here in columbus 

Recording: (9212/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (9213/ 10721) 
they are just not getting it right 

Recording: (9214/ 10721) 
and then uh up tending grad school 

Recording: (9215/ 10721) 
i mean even some places simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we will spend a good half hour forty five minutes just driving around till we actually decide to play or someone says something or whatever so 

Recording: (9216/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9217/ 10721) 
program again you know and uh then a lot of them i do not think are capable well in the present condition i know like but pretty much what i am talking about there is no way in hell they get off down the job 

Recording: (9218/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9219/ 10721) 
it will be fun 

Recording: (9220/ 10721) 
yeah exactly pass through it  random jobs for 

Recording: (9221/ 10721) 
and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute you know i my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to you know get all the opportunities that we are out there or for them and and it just did not happen that you know that we both had the same he wanted everything to be the same you know so i think that really changed everything one kind of it does your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody is listening and everything you want to do somebody is 

Recording: (9222/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (9223/ 10721) 
so because he and i always discussed politics and so 

Recording: (9224/ 10721) 
 yes exactly 

Recording: (9225/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9226/ 10721) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park are roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need that need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (9227/ 10721) 
how many times you been in ireland 

Recording: (9228/ 10721) 
no the funniest thing though is with my husband and the youngest child because he is so he is so fair and he said in the hospital people are looking at him like there is no way that could happen  he said that because you know they take them off to weigh them or whatever and i he said you do not leave him he said people are looking at him like 

Recording: (9229/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9230/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9231/ 10721) 
when we start moving again they have never learned and the reason why you are throwing a cure out too much in front of us saying hey you got to do this and prove this to me no we we we black in one heck of a lot of ethical morals standards in this country were losing every day until we start looking ourselves in in the mirror at night and say i am uh myself i am probably why i did i may not uh may a dollar a day but i understood somebody a day 

Recording: (9232/ 10721) 
my oldest son was in vietnam 

Recording: (9233/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9234/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9235/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (9236/ 10721) 
i have not been anywhere except for canada and uh um now i grew falls i was about three years old that is what my dad died while we was up or no less so  

Recording: (9237/ 10721) 
god i understand a few like inf it is like that uh but i can not say anything too serious has come up from it 

Recording: (9238/ 10721) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (9239/ 10721) 
yeah just in march 

Recording: (9240/ 10721) 
light news uh that is why i read tend to read the alternative newspapers and stuff because you do get a different perspective it is it is probably just slanted but it is different you are right 

Recording: (9241/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9242/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9243/ 10721) 
i do not know that i can answer your question straight forward because i believe in gay right i believe in anybody is rights i know what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not right 

Recording: (9244/ 10721) 
um what do you call it i 

Recording: (9245/ 10721) 
yeah gotten to a situation where you really there is a no one situation from the get go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do uh we you went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became a political war or something like that 

Recording: (9246/ 10721) 
highly skilled or trained in the area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i am i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because they are always different 

Recording: (9247/ 10721) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post part of depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control uh and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (9248/ 10721) 
for that for for that so he he got locked up and he is not allowed to see another human being 

Recording: (9249/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9250/ 10721) 
he is finding things for his family things you know what i found one of them way back and what was it sixteen seventy or something this boat load of people come over from england and they were the ones that had been deported from england because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or were the thief or something and i said would you be the only person i could find in my family is nothing but but uh convict  yeah you even got deported from the country i do not know why he was you know that that is a ship he was on 

Recording: (9251/ 10721) 
yes um well i was raised most of my life in ashland it is about ten minutes north of man isfield ohio and um i uh we moved there we moved there from mansfield so i have been living in the mansfield um 

Recording: (9252/ 10721) 
are not really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like to see them see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platform and that is all settled now and it is just sort of a you know the celebration type stuff well that is not interesting oh it could change them with the primaries like to me 

Recording: (9253/ 10721) 
well i think people that made that ball should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (9254/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9255/ 10721) 
okay well it is coming right you and i am twenty four i have got a two year old son and it is just past his birthday um thirty first so and i live by myself in a house and i work um up in that county apartment 

Recording: (9256/ 10721) 
right so a lot of them are already believing and that they have their own religion and they they are really faithful so that was the one of the main problems is that they um they had been so holding onto that for so long it is so strong they do not want to let go of well and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (9257/ 10721) 
but i finally just said okay we are just trying to train people to make money for computers so 

Recording: (9258/ 10721) 
i just do for the stretch it is almost like when i am laying there and and kathy is saying you know take it even though i sound speedy 

Recording: (9259/ 10721) 
you always preach get a union job you know 

Recording: (9260/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9261/ 10721) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember  a long time ago 

Recording: (9262/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9263/ 10721) 
and they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well they were not really probably too many other problems i mean the economy is doing really well and foreign relations are always shaky but they are huh 

Recording: (9264/ 10721) 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know it was kind of appalling to to the parents and everything i guess maybe this where i am coming from i mean uh the way some well the uh case dress you know a retel back to and with the bell bottoms and everything to us and they uh the piercing i just can not get into that you know and and some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my god they are that fourteen to six fifteen 

Recording: (9265/ 10721) 
maybe at the under lying base 

Recording: (9266/ 10721) 
or they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (9267/ 10721) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at lsu and they were um just asking people umhum if they thought that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i just like boy i think so yeah oh and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while that i read the performance and i really prayed about it and 

Recording: (9268/ 10721) 
pretty soon you see all the money that they have been making gone 

Recording: (9269/ 10721) 
drew downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i would not have to to pay fifty dollars a month for parking why why not do that and now there is also the whole pollution thing and and this types of things and i thought that was 

Recording: (9270/ 10721) 
secondant third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering that is one of the reasons they were not going to move me 

Recording: (9271/ 10721) 
i do not want to tend to ever leave here so 

Recording: (9272/ 10721) 
so it was one of those 

Recording: (9273/ 10721) 
no they are not it is printed at the top every on every issue that they are financially independent 

Recording: (9274/ 10721) 
i mean yes some people 

Recording: (9275/ 10721) 
is that i think i remember like if they were like reminding a few years back as i raised 

Recording: (9276/ 10721) 
yeah that is kind of all i kind of like think of a factory like a like a punch card or something but um and just how uh like there there is this whole thing area like we can not wear hats and uh in the building and the this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff it is just real funny to hear hear people speak like that and really believe it 

Recording: (9277/ 10721) 
i am going to get done with this i swear  

Recording: (9278/ 10721) 
brain what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff that does not even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is uh it is a struggle understanding that and uh uh i made it through all four rounds this time and uh i even sat up which was the first time um it is a struggle but 

Recording: (9279/ 10721) 
i can not 

Recording: (9280/ 10721) 
it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unique things 

Recording: (9281/ 10721) 
is that right 

Recording: (9282/ 10721) 
uhhuh i have i got a couple three applications in about the krogers and uh uh uh a days worth of job or cnn so it is nursing homes i kind of like doing stuff for people with it like that you know uh i worked at a castating at saint robbock i was uh uh home for the aged but i had a problem dealing with one on one basis with the older basis because they were very disvisiting you know they were not dirted on the other side 

Recording: (9283/ 10721) 
and we were staying at his grandpa and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and see all kinds of racial slars towards black people 

Recording: (9284/ 10721) 
but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (9285/ 10721) 
much but he is always saying oh this is racist and that is racist but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know their place is lots worse like the south and so on course uh who who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (9286/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9287/ 10721) 
i do not know just exactly where the others are but they are here in the clumber area 

Recording: (9288/ 10721) 
communicate as you say through the in the and through businesses but we do not have compassion and we do not have commitment without those three you will never have success 

Recording: (9289/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (9290/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9291/ 10721) 
no my mom is uh she is not embe uh she is seventy two years old but they go out usually to yard sales and stuff like that stuff i do not want to do 

Recording: (9292/ 10721) 
yeah because of the traffic but see where i live i could get on the bus if i just wanted to go downtown real bad 

Recording: (9293/ 10721)

when the freeway was built i seventy was built through town and a lot a lot of times you do not realize what kind of havoc that creates when threeways built through the middle of a town because you have to take out a lot of houses to do that and you you can sort of realize it if you ever go around the area and go to one of the little side streets that dead ends because the freeways there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been twenty or 

Recording: (9437/ 10721) 
and it was just when drug culture was just you know starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you would have to talk to them about things and just say you know i want to help you and i you know be there for them a hundred percent obviously those parents were too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be to blame my due

Recording: (9449/ 10721) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is an extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just everyone there is a a bad right in the story so children just are and i mean it is in there that and then including my own daughter she and i swear i had her watch mister rogers all the time but now that she is older she watches tv 

Recording: (9450/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9451/ 10721) 
i am retired 

Recording: (9452/ 10721) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think that was maybe five or six when mom moved into an apartment in german village 

Recording: (9453/ 10721) 
um somehow really yeah  and if they if everybody would just begin to build that way and when they start to say something nasty i would think well i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (9454/ 10721) 
yeah so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters  

Recording: (9455/ 10721) 
a little out of the way backwards okay yeah  do the do the that that that does not try to be the uhhuh uhhuh just 

Recording: (9456/ 10721) 
well that is good that is good 

Recording: (9457/ 10721) 
but we still need to have property management records that is very essential and a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it uh they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of of our activity on that whether it is been uh installed or removed relocated where my b but we need to know that how it has an impact upon the design of 

Recording: (9458/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9459/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9460/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9461/ 10721) 
you know like there are two fisherman that found him and see you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay the the miami the other one thinks he should get back with his father you do not hear about him as reading about a newsweek or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (9462/ 10721) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (9463/ 10721) 
umhum hmhum type of yeah 

Recording: (9464/ 10721) 
i mean as far as that goes i mean there is really nothing more he can do i mean 

Recording: (9465/ 10721) 
yeah it was cutting twenty pounds in three days 

Recording: (9466/ 10721) 
i wish i knew the answer uh but but reality you know uh i just feel sorry for the the people that not only feel that they have to do that but in this and also for the people that are involved in it and the other this victims and everything and their parents and everything the only one i really had uh i was really upset was uh the columbine deal and that was because uh the one kid was making bonds and stuff like that and the base that and the parents knew nothing 

Recording: (9467/ 10721) 
um because he he likes the he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yell but it is or nothing yeah i tried to talk to them 

Recording: (9468/ 10721) 
oh no no i do not feel that at all in the you know we do not hesitate or to get together with other friends and take our kids places i do not remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or you know i do not remember things like that and uh it could have been there maybe but 

Recording: (9469/ 10721) 
in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a matriarchie one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would  go all over you know but uh if uh if uh we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would very and i then in the years that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life uh was 

Recording: (9470/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9471/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9472/ 10721) 
okay how do you do how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (9473/ 10721) 
yeah and a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for a very intellectual interesting environment but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that   yeah  

Recording: (9474/ 10721) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a million or without the lawsuits of different yeah experiences um sexual harassment 

Recording: (9475/ 10721) 
oh you have to nowadays you know i do not understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just does not have now now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing forty hours a week too so it is it is work and it is a full time job so they started shooting the seven year old just here it is the end of the year second grade she brings home this project 

Recording: (9476/ 10721) 
i can not are capable of that i am in a luxury i guess where we are in a position where i i truly do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in yepter year he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit and rb to to to take care of that but having family was him the first years and a half um i do not know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the sixty percent when he was 

Recording: (9477/ 10721) 
with the the children 

Recording: (9478/ 10721) 
helped them yeah 

Recording: (9479/ 10721) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet uh you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violent and callography and you know things that we you know when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was in you know last see and tom and jerry i mean you know these but you know they were not violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i just think i do not think 

Recording: (9480/ 10721) 
um i have been there twice already 

Recording: (9481/ 10721) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does not i mean i was surprised like i i would i have never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one actually 

Recording: (9482/ 10721) 
oh it was on saturday 

Recording: (9483/ 10721) 
yeah they he is burning couches and uh over by perot alley they are actually rolling a volkswagen down the alley  and there is all kinds of people doing it 

Recording: (9484/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9485/ 10721) 
i do not know how that is even possible 

Recording: (9486/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9487/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9488/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9489/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (9490/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (9491/ 10721) 
oh no we just had a whole conversation come on now 

Recording: (9492/ 10721) 
it is only just um the last one i did was um richardson which is right across from what is down park 

Recording: (9493/ 10721) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like the traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an operation type thing like like it is more of like a it is not like an mtv type thing you know 

Recording: (9494/ 10721) 
yeah he actually his his dad is mother babysits 

Recording: (9495/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (9496/ 10721) 
i just think it is a different time now i do not think uh i think everybody is living more for today in talking about the future you know hoping that the future is there i think there is a uh quote unquote uh in time aspect to life you know 

Recording: (9497/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9498/ 10721) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just come in from my christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice that they would teach you how to be confident in yourself and i do not mean like selfesteem but you know like we said if if 

Recording: (9499/ 10721) 
i really am not educated in that at all so i would not probably say anything since i would ignorant the field um 

Recording: (9500/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9501/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9502/ 10721) 
uh it did not did not turn out very well so they switched it over to me uh for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university is fault uh they had to rely on confidential information which we could not give because it was confidential uh by federal law was confident so we could not give it to them but they needed it so it it was just not a good good way to do business uh um 

Recording: (9503/ 10721) 
in what way 

Recording: (9504/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9505/ 10721) 
but it was not the worry about getting pregnant it was the worry about getting aids 

Recording: (9506/ 10721) 
and that maybe would like crash one the the wedding the  

Recording: (9507/ 10721) 
all the cool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (9508/ 10721) 
but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and i would well help then permeate the entire society and but it is got to start back here at the first and i think 

Recording: (9509/ 10721) 
well i am staying on the whole world i they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think that maybe he sounds the same way but maybe not much because i have i thought when i retired i was going to get this done and this done and this done and i am wondering now how i went to work and still got so many things done but i got home and i am sure from doing it just as fast as over and over again people say i have never seen anybody with as much energy you are always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (9510/ 10721) 
yeah well 

Recording: (9511/ 10721) 
and do not insulted us anymore or we will go to trial uh so my attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth to what they thought i was worth even the arthritisator was an ass hole um but uh that is the way that system more 

Recording: (9512/ 10721) 
my thesis is on the suitate in germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia uh before the second world war and uh specifically i am looking at how they perceive to their condition switching from being part of the australian empire uh and the germans being sort of the the majority uh even though they were not the majority but sort of the the uh the master nation within the australian empire 

Recording: (9513/ 10721) 
well do you we look there is a tornado over there and right at that time a big old pine tree got pushed across you know it is already been broken but it just that nashelotley pushed across the freeway and he goes that is not tornado that is fog man that is too far i said what 

Recording: (9514/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9515/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9516/ 10721) 
to their own guilt and um  um so i have got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it another side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh a reincarnation and law cause and effect and if a person murder somebody they need they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made 

Recording: (9517/ 10721) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (9518/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9519/ 10721) 
i mean i 

Recording: (9520/ 10721) 
which is not far from here so i did that for a while but uh it was not very uh satisfying because i really feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at huckle berry house 

Recording: (9521/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9522/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9523/ 10721) 
yeah right i taught um well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i have been in 

Recording: (9524/ 10721) 
oh yeah i was never going to get married again i had my house with kids you know i had already done that i was financially secure and i did not i was not even looking one of my best friends though at the time uh she saw this guy she he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and i talked to this girl every day and she was like oh you have to meet him you have to be well it is like oh you know call me tomorrow i do not want to meet anybody so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were she was right i mean you know 

Recording: (9525/ 10721) 
from the media uh and i say media broad based and you would be at print media or tv um that has this culture today of um stars and you know media of uh phenomena and and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not uh again i do not know what the the answer is 

Recording: (9526/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9527/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9528/ 10721) 
it is only a yeah it is only a couple people it is not majority of people are working around black but like i said a majority of the people i am working around i get along with great 

Recording: (9529/ 10721) 
than to do that 

Recording: (9530/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (9531/ 10721) 
no noise i am so used to like turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound that i have to like have music on in the room so is not that down here hm yeah i really like the city i like the night life everything in in ashland man isfield shops down at nine thirty ten oclock and it all starts up 

Recording: (9532/ 10721) 
yeah my kids were both two two weeks late so i know how that is  

Recording: (9533/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9534/ 10721) 
oh yeah herb 

Recording: (9535/ 10721) 
she is the type of person i love to in no way 

Recording: (9536/ 10721) 
yeah four girls 

Recording: (9537/ 10721) 
it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (9538/ 10721) 
oh yeah by the 

Recording: (9539/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (9540/ 10721) 
that is mean that is why nobody brings it 

Recording: (9541/ 10721) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (9542/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9543/ 10721) 
uh i got there when out of high school 

Recording: (9544/ 10721) 
and this sort of thing then you are leaving out a large part of the population so i am not sure it is going to give valid results anyway 

Recording: (9545/ 10721) 
um i i think it fills it is niche you know i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a and um i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (9546/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9547/ 10721) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (9548/ 10721) 
now i got them 

Recording: (9549/ 10721) 
it is about the same 

Recording: (9550/ 10721) 
no uh it was just the usual things and she touched my things  yeah because they were far aparted up they had their own umhum and your own friends and you know so that and interest so it there was not much of that but there was the usual you know she is breathing on me in the car he is i mean too loud  i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have i mean you have been through it all yeah 

Recording: (9551/ 10721) 
no wonder if that is also a socialized medicine there it it is socialized it 

Recording: (9552/ 10721) 
no that is i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tubes ties is is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still not still much cheaper than them having kids um um and then if they i give them more money they clean up their act just for them um as far as it being races i do not think 

Recording: (9553/ 10721) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9554/ 10721) 
that is nice 

Recording: (9555/ 10721) 
and telecommunication is very much like a highway you need to know what your load is going to be before you can structure or vice you know other ways your planning is way off well nowadays we are in the physician where we are doing more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio and the private network uh as a private sector is still looking at us looking at us as a show case we are doing voice overip in a in an uproar call which means we are doing voice and data over the same type and 

Recording: (9556/ 10721) 
yeah it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9557/ 10721) 
no it is not 

Recording: (9558/ 10721) 
and uh then the powers that be in the american army decided will will go up to this little area of uh for four months 

Recording: (9559/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9560/ 10721) 
to say you know what i am thinking of somebody shoot those people but i 

Recording: (9561/ 10721) 
oh i would say family values custom is traditions um divorce moving just looking at my sister like my sister i mean she is very happily married but my god i mean they they lived here in columbus he is from they met here they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they are in london england they 

Recording: (9562/ 10721) 
let us watch seven and nine 

Recording: (9563/ 10721) 
i think it is too late i do i 

Recording: (9564/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9565/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9566/ 10721) 
i do not think i can answer that 

Recording: (9567/ 10721) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she she had not given and been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her 

Recording: (9568/ 10721) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is a you do not need a husband all you need is a burn bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9569/ 10721) 
was not really farming country and he went he went out there from iowa where you throw a hundred dollars on the field 

Recording: (9570/ 10721) 
oh it is just so the environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and uh you know i think it is a friend much friendier place and then i i i just think the vibration are higher out there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live 

Recording: (9571/ 10721) 
just 

Recording: (9572/ 10721) 
it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (9573/ 10721) 
no i wanted to see her obviously but 

Recording: (9574/ 10721) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these like matinee specials where you can go with like a buck fifty huh  

Recording: (9575/ 10721) 
they they just set up a on a flat bed truck on wall street in new york and do a concert there  

Recording: (9576/ 10721) 
and she was from germany which made it a little tough because you know they did not talk about that uh those things over there at all for a long time but um and she became very open with them and but everybody knew and that was in the eighties and you know if some kids know it when they are young and growing up you no i do not know if it is best to not say it or to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better than 

Recording: (9577/ 10721) 
yeah they started in two thousand three 

Recording: (9578/ 10721) 
that is great 

Recording: (9579/ 10721) 
basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get everything instilled at home uh that is pretty much what you know i have seen talk it to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (9580/ 10721) 
sure you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had them a zoge of them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george ww is going to be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i and pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that is going against what most americans are saying dull i think represented were most americans 

Recording: (9581/ 10721) 
yeah i have been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when i moved up to delaware  it is it is a real comfor me you know comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9582/ 10721) 
they saw us have difficult times and they saw us saw us our spouse is crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you could have been in human relations they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw overnight where i would start care carrying from a dad because my mother died instantly you know like short term an hour and now he has struck i did not know whether i stayed all their lives and i had learned all that and 

Recording: (9583/ 10721) 
i think my grandpa goes to church 

Recording: (9584/ 10721) 
well see 

Recording: (9585/ 10721) 
um honestly it would be i would probably based a decision basically political uh um i can not say i had really held that against him or anything obviously it is not something i would say oh good what is so for him since he did that 

Recording: (9586/ 10721) 
well they need to destroy do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and they made that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (9587/ 10721) 
right wow 

Recording: (9588/ 10721) 
yeah like underground yeah it is gotten real big like it is still different too there is still like a really big scene and there is still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (9589/ 10721) 
she graduated last year so uh but she went to she went she is in home study so 

Recording: (9590/ 10721) 
and it only took uh less than two months 

Recording: (9591/ 10721) 
instead to pick up on oh so and so is arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give a background on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the store i mean there is definitely much more out they are that is going on then they are telling you um so i really do not see a big problem with 

Recording: (9592/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9593/ 10721) 
means then that just giving them the number that we spent more time doing that uh 

Recording: (9594/ 10721) 
and you have been going to the united states that whole time 

Recording: (9595/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9596/ 10721) 
i said yep i said you you caught mommy saying a bad word and you would be going to open them up yep so i go in the bathroom now what i always wish to tell the kids was stick your tongue out and i just or bit of soap on into her tongue well now i have been i had fall teeth and size about thirty two needless i had fall teeth and this kid did this and she had run about five years old going out about i sat down on that toilet seat when i sat there i take out my tongue she takes that cake is so she does not rub my tongue she twisted it it got on my teeth and it took 

Recording: (9597/ 10721) 
umhum yeah there is almost nobody anymore that is willing to do uh just uh minuscule things unless you are going to be uh it is just always money money money money money money money money just a 

Recording: (9598/ 10721) 
as he was speaking and and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are because the world in essence it is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something i think that is had a tremendous influence also on and our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (9599/ 10721) 
go back and uh uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values uh i could even still go to first and say or boston or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and 

Recording: (9600/ 10721) 
well uh i was living on a homestead out in northern montana and then my parents moved back to iowa which was their home area southern iowa i grew up there attended high school there and i uh went to iowa state for five quarters and i just did not get it and then uh i worked around home for a 

Recording: (9601/ 10721) 
that is all i understand is money 

Recording: (9602/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9603/ 10721)

Recording: (9605/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9606/ 10721) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is not insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is not insane and uh just to to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind 

Recording: (9607/ 10721) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people 

Recording: (9608/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9609/ 10721) 
but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned to his uh parents is that gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned fifty and they do not have any kids and he says well i do not know how you do it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrifice and when you sacrifice it becomes it makes you more humble 

Recording: (9610/ 10721)

Recording: (9611/ 10721) 
yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people they are you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then you know i think it is kind of  

Recording: (9612/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9613/ 10721) 
i think it is better probably if the do not let me say anything about you know and most of the people you know like when you get to i lived in a barics a whole time but i mean you know a lot of people you know they get their own places off base you know and who cares what they say i mean i do not care yeah like i say i have a girlfriend you know i do not care what they do i mean they are old enough to do whatever else they want to do you know 

Recording: (9614/ 10721) 
i was married but it did not have any kids once you have kids you are not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off any time and then when i got my master is i went into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need to resource teacher why do not you come up and interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position and got another position but anyway it all worked out 

Recording: (9615/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (9616/ 10721) 
the people who who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from columbus so 

Recording: (9617/ 10721) 
hi i am a pervertible  

Recording: (9618/ 10721)

Recording: (9619/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9620/ 10721) 
um it is an eo trip that is all it is basically like what i can do this 

Recording: (9621/ 10721) 
it is over off of uh thirty three two seventy and thirty three 

Recording: (9622/ 10721) 
well and and especially in my situation you know that uh i think about it quite a bit you know if i were to had uh more of an opportunity to have a one on one uh relationship with her i probably uh uh being a girl you know could have probably helped her out in uh in a lot of associates social things social things you know about yeah because i i kind of get the impression that she is not really she still is not very interested in men you know so 

Recording: (9623/ 10721) 
no because like the i work like i said my supervisor is a black woman and i get along good with her the the other woman that is an indian woman i get real along real good with her the other guy is black i get along real good with her but my supervisor is got a friend that is a black woman that works in another department now she will come and talk to her and double huhuh 

Recording: (9624/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9625/ 10721) 
i so i had a tendency that it would really help them um it would just be better if somebody could you know keep their eyes open or if we had um more counselors or think is like that to deal with everything including that 

Recording: (9626/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9627/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9628/ 10721) 
uh it was for me and a couple of other people and that was it 

Recording: (9629/ 10721) 
they do not have any like a day just they are not like on a day just to be sure is was really like 

Recording: (9630/ 10721) 
well i among the people i know i i you know we are i i think it is a pretty tolerant city um uh i know a lot of people who live done an old town you know in a very uh diverse environment and um um you know i just i just do not i do not uh i do not think 

Recording: (9631/ 10721) 
she goes well you had dad dukakis money i said oh lord 

Recording: (9632/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9633/ 10721) 
you know he had had 

Recording: (9634/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9635/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9636/ 10721) 
if they are any germans in there i will bet they are scared  

Recording: (9637/ 10721) 
you know like reading about things that happen to people like their kids sitting up in their face or something 

Recording: (9638/ 10721) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (9639/ 10721) 
well um my family is so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together now you know uh it back then you know my i do not know you did not see her uh you did she is cute she is got a little hair cut and she is our like but um 

Recording: (9640/ 10721) 
yeah i got a son he is a senior daughter by 

Recording: (9641/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9642/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (9643/ 10721) 
i think they are missing the the point because i am sure there is some run away white teenage girls out there too or mexican or whatnot um 

Recording: (9644/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9645/ 10721) 
and also at the show of hands calories and 

Recording: (9646/ 10721) 
 no i am i am not really up on the coaching thing i mean any biking coach a game that takes players to play the game 

Recording: (9647/ 10721) 
no i really just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (9648/ 10721) 
umhum so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking now i got to get it together what am i going to do so he uh agreed to go to a psychiatrist and uh so he went on riddler uh so he took the the last of his junior year and his senior year now he is on a medication they call uh well future 

Recording: (9649/ 10721) 
other person is wrong and leave it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right duke i i i honestly do not know uh people get really scared they are certain i mean like there is certain denomination that will take one it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it 

Recording: (9650/ 10721) 
um as far as affiliated with a party i probably respond to um republicans more the democrats but i think given any um given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (9651/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9652/ 10721) 
exactly right yeah yeah and you know a lot of people i work with do not see that and you know they think i am a real cheapskate you know because you know i will i spend money you know and well i i am very in fact if i mean like uh i would love to go to disney world and there are people work that would not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in you know now i drive there i do not fly because i am really that cheap but you know i would love to fly but i just go oh my gosh and you know but you know i will do that but you know like um like at uh thanksgiving time we do not buy a butter ball turkey we 

Recording: (9653/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9654/ 10721) 
ended up uh running away from home yeah 

Recording: (9655/ 10721) 
the medication is like the difference between night and day you go back and observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids does not pay them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they bunch of growth and they subdo your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headache from dexadrein and ader all so i say you know if it works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because 

Recording: (9656/ 10721) 
uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know uh then i would have at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (9657/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9658/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (9659/ 10721) 
because i have become in popular if i have like any time away from my girlfriend 

Recording: (9660/ 10721) 
oriers that are out there men and women that will do that uh more power to them uh all i can do is pray them out and that is what i suggest to everybody else that is the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the nuns in high school that taught me had a post around the wall that said more things are in this world by prayer than will ever know 

Recording: (9661/ 10721) 
this little kid who still has a living parent and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line and 

Recording: (9662/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9663/ 10721) 
i know i um  i can not wait because i the house we live in it is a half double when we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but you know i have like eighty plants in my house now but i just can not wait to have my own space i never plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i am going to leave you know and 

Recording: (9664/ 10721) 
yeah we have run an on line system where people use and connect to our system and build the data bases or or access to data bases um it is state the uh everything in issue has in their library collection is in our system their records came from us uh yeah the well the yeah and we do that for uh tens of thousands of laboris yeah 

Recording: (9665/ 10721) 
uh being here at the university 

Recording: (9666/ 10721) 
but not all of them are uh you know are that way 

Recording: (9667/ 10721) 
i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it is you know dealt with in a common reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids they had three 

Recording: (9668/ 10721) 
just a job  that is an awesome job 

Recording: (9669/ 10721) 
see i i he is a he is just he is in his two is and i like he is got to be in a cart or something well because when i am holding his hand taking him he just tends to want to he is not common collective he is little you know um i feel like that is why we do not do nothing because when i take on a people is houses i can not do that because they will get into everything and i i am i get real stressed out about that i do not i do not 

Recording: (9670/ 10721) 
yes private homes and um actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (9671/ 10721) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (9672/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9673/ 10721) 
i would say probably the black man 

Recording: (9674/ 10721) 
i have been some places where some men refused to sweat with women sometimes i felt kind of weird about it 

Recording: (9675/ 10721) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (9676/ 10721) 
yeah  that is it  

Recording: (9677/ 10721) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (9678/ 10721) 
right and and also the other thing is you you have to be sort of compassionate because like you know you are you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you spit something out you want to and answer you know each airplane is supposed to respond with their calls on like if i tell somebody you know turn left getting three six there on he is supposed to respond t to a three ninety six roger well if he does not respond then i have got to say it again which means instead of ten airplanes i now have eleven i am talking to because i have to tell talk to him two times each so you know there are some people that get really 

Recording: (9679/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (9680/ 10721) 
no i mean it is nothing crazy where they think they are got and 

Recording: (9681/ 10721) 
if that happened i would be ten times more understanding and i would say you know i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes 

Recording: (9682/ 10721) 
they do not do it today unless the person is a scholar i mean i have got three point eight road scouts and i am like hey okay 

Recording: (9683/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9684/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9685/ 10721) 
yes but you know what his parents are going you know really going to let people know that 

Recording: (9686/ 10721) 
and then they physically died before they got a chance to live and while and their spirit wakes up and finds out that they are physically dead and they can not do anything in a physical world anymore they want to draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person they want to draw them to the brightest things 

Recording: (9687/ 10721) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he found himself because he was hot 

Recording: (9688/ 10721) 
yeah  i do not really have any childhood recollctions of california yeah  

Recording: (9689/ 10721) 
um well the bathroom is starting to sound good right about 

Recording: (9690/ 10721) 
got help here to make the home and i think that that is one of the problem too many people think instead of just getting them to lovely help each other because we are supposed to help each other and this goes all right back to what i said you said beginning in school or kindergarten i think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a all and rock it and sing to it put it to bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up teach them how to tie their shoes and take them off teach them how to do everything they 

Recording: (9691/ 10721) 
okay so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect not ever been to fall off so far uh yeah so yeah well oh well i will give you any that anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would trial that is where it is one of my that house and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got twelve years old and i better watch a little more care for my own age real did catch me doing something i had to tell him no you can not do i would apologize to him mom he was bad and mom he did that i have to have a mouth umhum  well well no no i mean now i go near the store to find things to be able to see why i will sit here this pie i will be telling them the cherry pie or uhhuh umhum i guess that is uh i mean that is their problem or ours  oh 

Recording: (9692/ 10721) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (9693/ 10721) 
before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and there were a few hm you know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes i mean not directly they 

Recording: (9694/ 10721) 
even republicans were like that 

Recording: (9695/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9696/ 10721) 
it is been completely outrageous story lines and like the jokes are not as integrated to the story 

Recording: (9697/ 10721) 
just get me a couple of shirts or something you know she always bought me clothes anyway so since getting me a couple of shirts or anything whatever you think i need you know i will be here drinking beer watch it umhum 

Recording: (9698/ 10721) 
back there black so it is right near like a lot of other student housing 

Recording: (9699/ 10721) 
right and i was also robbed about three times delivering pizzas for domino is in the campus area really uh a couple of times we are down uh a little bit south of campus fourth street and fifth avenue near there fourth street and seventh and but once was right on practically on campus sixteenth avenue at near high street i was robbed there once yeah near 

Recording: (9700/ 10721) 
and i said turn it go you know i tell people i even like the b a clinic and everything and i got the homeless thing uh over there and i said you know this guy friend i know you know he is a vietnam but the guys need to get out to and help him you know i mean you are in more of a uh situation than i have to be able to go out and and and sit or but he wants to be taking like mary habit or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is take to her so she is up and goof back out 

Recording: (9701/ 10721) 
that goes a lot longer than just giving them because if they give it they do not do it so i i really i really think uh um as i would say traveling uh people are all the same world wide they just give them different colors different it is yeah different accents to so god can get them unique characteristics so he can call them his own he knows each one of us but uh we are all the same age down 

Recording: (9702/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9703/ 10721) 
and they fought a lot there was a lot of violence and then i loved walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i i swear i have not seen a disney movie that does not have violence in it 

Recording: (9704/ 10721) 
they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one death and they were giving him three deaths 

Recording: (9705/ 10721) 
 yeah 

Recording: (9706/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9707/ 10721) 
i see no i mean it it 

Recording: (9708/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9709/ 10721) 
the drivers are not so insane like they are here like people are a little bit more laid back just because like um i do not know and parts of it is really insane but like sometimes people which is like because it is all because it is nice weather people do not get so like aggravated by like here it is like cold and and gray and you just want to like yellow people and they are and stuff or something i do not know i do not know if you know what the deal is 

Recording: (9710/ 10721) 
oh wow 

Recording: (9711/ 10721) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look how i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (9712/ 10721) 
oh sure 

Recording: (9713/ 10721) 
well i believe it is quality uh ideally you know uh one parent would be there if he uh male or female you know man or what i mean where are we but uh but you know your quality time is more important you know and if you go come home and you are no all you want to do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever you know not spend any time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are there for two hours 

Recording: (9714/ 10721) 
over in dayton and we are calling from zamesville office i rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going or dayton we can make the calls if it is a local call of waiting all long distance 

Recording: (9715/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9716/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (9717/ 10721) 
i was trying to avoid that question  no but uh i thought you know just get a little in sight on what is going on out there in delaware and you know maybe possibly find someone to be with but 

Recording: (9718/ 10721) 
should not you have a little more knowledge a little more support around you educating knowing selfdiscipline and one of what is on a really untilus really is when you have multiple fathers and the children do not know the dads 

Recording: (9719/ 10721) 
we are having like three concerts the next month  

Recording: (9720/ 10721) 
i do not remember because i could probably sell 

Recording: (9721/ 10721) 
so and it was it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen and so pete was just like some kids who liked to play you know we would go and buy kites and and do all that is fun stuff and 

Recording: (9722/ 10721) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (9723/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (9724/ 10721) 
and they never were i mean the same with like in friends especially uh mcdonald is well mcdonald is in the school of all the french people you know i mean 

Recording: (9725/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9726/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9727/ 10721) 
well yeah when he was i do not remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been collic or whatever but he just cried and you know 

Recording: (9728/ 10721) 
most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (9729/ 10721) 
there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with children 

Recording: (9730/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9731/ 10721) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to the high state um compared to miami university i saw i see a difference as in the standards of the of the students um but i believe and i have seen it with my son going out of state that his more uh he is gained through his uh pre college years are staying with him uh and i am very grateful that there is 

Recording: (9732/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (9733/ 10721) 
i did not realize that 

Recording: (9734/ 10721) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but you know with aids and that as rampant as is now and there is so many more women that have it um start off as mostly men um women have got to know as at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (9735/ 10721) 
you have spelled every name you have read every name you have written every name practically there are not any that you have not heard of 

Recording: (9736/ 10721) 
she is doing all right as far as i know she is going to the saint louis university on it do not ask me why but 

Recording: (9737/ 10721) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (9738/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9739/ 10721) 
but in the winters when you know i mean i do not exercise that much 

Recording: (9740/ 10721) 
so i you know i i just think the more you are open about things i just think that is the best why you know when you put things and do not talk about it that is when the problems start 

Recording: (9741/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (9742/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9743/ 10721) 
again they said the 

Recording: (9744/ 10721) 
so they thought well gee you know free country free land to a farmer so uh they went out there but had said in eleven years that they were out there they only raised three or four crops 

Recording: (9745/ 10721) 
um no english

Recording: (9747/ 10721) 
kind of dwindling  

Recording: (9748/ 10721)

Recording: (9764/ 10721) 
because i i did not start dating until i was almost seventeen but almost everybody else had even i am going to be thirty six here in a week or two so we are talking i graduated in eighty two where now i think kids are dating at like ten eleven twelve 

Recording: (9765/ 10721)

Recording: (9766/ 10721) 
oh in the city 

Recording: (9767/ 10721) 
uh actually he um in the fifties he had a jazz club and um it was real popular it had food and live music like um peggy lee thing there and some kind of name people i was not around but  um and also we had a private club that um it was similar to to the bunny club it was the key club where people had to pay a membership and it was in a real nice uh area downtown here and he is also uh owned um 

Recording: (9768/ 10721) 
are they friendly her than than the goalays 

Recording: (9769/ 10721) 
oh uhhuh 

Recording: (9770/ 10721) 
very very much so now fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that that as socialism well in the manner we just define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today no longer a democratic government as defined back there then huh yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition and it is 

Recording: (9771/ 10721) 
so i started to get it out i spelled it and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word lenient down here here is two little shoes  

Recording: (9772/ 10721) 
but i 

Recording: (9773/ 10721) 
well you know it is because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know did not cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars i would i was happy 

Recording: (9774/ 10721) 
with two more can i am wondering how many more hours a day you can squeeze out a couple personal life so they will have sanity at sometime in their life to enjoy life when these people start realizing hey it is we are chasing our tails then those two that that couple got wise and said hey we are going to do with less and we are for quality when that when that couple reaches that mentality mister knowone officer you are going to have a greater society to work with 

Recording: (9775/ 10721) 
whether they are play a video game where they are shooting people i can not say say that it is being something that affects them 

Recording: (9776/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9777/ 10721) 
it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i will be gone by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for a small school and they just open up their phd program in education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science in a it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views 

Recording: (9778/ 10721) 
christians  

Recording: (9779/ 10721) 
made you all the way around 

Recording: (9780/ 10721) 
i think that i do not think the divorce is a bad thing i think that it it is if you are married and you we will that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other where for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i 

Recording: (9781/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9782/ 10721) 
yes umhum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there to do those things so and i mean there there are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does that sort of make me mad when you know people are kind of like oh clark you know there is nothing to do there i find myself defending clumus a lot more now than 

Recording: (9783/ 10721) 
r u t e 

Recording: (9784/ 10721) 
not really no i was too proud i would have never i would have never i think my dad paid my first month rent for me though i paid him back and then i know i never i never wanted to borrow any money i guess just growing up the youngest of five i appreciated money 

Recording: (9785/ 10721) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids and but it will not be him ing it  

Recording: (9786/ 10721) 
you know compared to any other cities course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (9787/ 10721) 
they are all at day care they you know and they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter who is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the day so 

Recording: (9788/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9789/ 10721) 
i mean we went in there one day and you know i explained the whole thing to her and then she puts off some kind of excuse the administrator she says well we do not need problem students like yourself blah blah blah i said what problem 

Recording: (9790/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9791/ 10721) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else it is just suits me fine 

Recording: (9792/ 10721) 
i mean they they went to the polls and rows you did not have to you know the the the hope there was that they would not go to vote  on the school level uh but actually trying to get college kids and involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (9793/ 10721) 
umhum because i want his morals and his you know his basic stuff to come from me really 

Recording: (9794/ 10721) 
umhum yeah yeah i would say anything outside would like doing that 

Recording: (9795/ 10721) 
you had a harvest did not you 

Recording: (9796/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9797/ 10721) 
he will basic yeah he will basically tell you he do not have enough fathers to for me 

Recording: (9798/ 10721) 
i do it so 

Recording: (9799/ 10721) 
yeah avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do better decisions would help 

Recording: (9800/ 10721) 
well it depends i think i would like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites um in the symphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems uh because a lot of the people in that group are paid uh uh i get i get paid kind of a semi professional 

Recording: (9801/ 10721) 
imparting some pretty good so 

Recording: (9802/ 10721) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list their just regular voters and cross out those who voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of 

Recording: (9803/ 10721) 
um yeah i mean i have got girls that are that have girlfriends and stuff and it does not bother me i i mean i am not i like men and i i am i am a christian and i just believe that you know you should be and god did not put two women on the sort of god did not put two men they put a man and a woman to be together to have kids 

Recording: (9804/ 10721) 
is in the same way here 

Recording: (9805/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9806/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9807/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9808/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9809/ 10721) 
gone downhill a lot 

Recording: (9810/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9811/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9812/ 10721) 
and and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9813/ 10721) 
uh probably 

Recording: (9814/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9815/ 10721) 
oh  

Recording: (9816/ 10721) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home uh my dad uh had to support us uh there were four of us in our uh their has disabilities and uh she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (9817/ 10721) 
that is ridiculous it is like barbaraism to me like uh 

Recording: (9818/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (9819/ 10721) 
i have talked to all my family my brothers and sisters every day 

Recording: (9820/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9821/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9822/ 10721) 
it is really whacky stuff 

Recording: (9823/ 10721) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (9824/ 10721) 
uh but thewow the only reason i get thewowpatch is i do one that what is going on locally 

Recording: (9825/ 10721) 
asard and ad in the paper uh but i have sung well sean sings in the symphony course too i have sung for sixteen years 

Recording: (9826/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9827/ 10721) 
too much 

Recording: (9828/ 10721) 
like 

Recording: (9829/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9830/ 10721) 
you know my older sister is different case she is a little better but it it is you know as long as you have a good parent it is you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom mom with my mother and father she she did very well 

Recording: (9831/ 10721) 
i do not know to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what is true so 

Recording: (9832/ 10721) 
yeah i do that 

Recording: (9833/ 10721) 
yeah yeah  it might be umhum umhum 

Recording: (9834/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9835/ 10721) 
that was kind of neat though 

Recording: (9836/ 10721) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she is still that she lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (9837/ 10721) 
i think that the 

Recording: (9838/ 10721) 
the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just buy them somewhere and then for you but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you i you kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and you know that would be interesting oh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that uh you know if they are if they are caught uh in in any kind of 

Recording: (9839/ 10721) 
so i am sure that probably creates the right in public schools for 

Recording: (9840/ 10721) 
it is it is amazing and that is something i know my husband we always joke about he talks tells his guys at work you know like um you know to take flowers for no reason you know well like like one guy was telling he was saying some of them was there in virginia and peter said well i can take flowers home and he kind of goes oh i do not know and he said trust me take some flowers 

Recording: (9841/ 10721) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is it is really he he nurses them too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (9842/ 10721) 
 no we are visit and 

Recording: (9843/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (9844/ 10721) 
and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (9845/ 10721) 
no commitment these guys have commitment and you see guys out there the one may go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe fill something whatever it is you ask each individual what is it drives you and that is the thing i get so perturban interviews they ask somebody and and somebody comes in and say you know what i mean yeah uh what did he no i do not get inside the guy is mind i do not want to what did he mean 

Recording: (9846/ 10721) 
well they are supposed to do more too but by the time they get the fourth grade they are so busy trying to be the class clown they decide it is a lot more important to impress your friends and it is to fill your mind with knowledge which 

Recording: (9847/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9848/ 10721) 
she just used the word penalty uh penalty has a lots of different definition each individual has uh mental picture what the word penalty means baseball and their own experiences oh i want to take just an you say penalty in a very general or to what ever your extreme is to the right or to the left let us come back to about the middle i am 

Recording: (9849/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9850/ 10721) 
okay i i 

Recording: (9851/ 10721) 
and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is very very hard thing to accomplish especially when you have gotten into this like you said me me me and i got to have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids but i know i myself 

Recording: (9852/ 10721) 
it is in northern ohio it is near illeria which is west of cleveland 

Recording: (9853/ 10721) 
well i do not i hear some of that from gorbachev and that is much 

Recording: (9854/ 10721) 
and understood what i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that is what i believe my faith is my faith is is faith it is believing that things happen that you can not explain there is it is believing that uh you are doing what you are doing is right so religians are a real big part of my life 

Recording: (9855/ 10721) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (9856/ 10721) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects the stimulation and people with a lot of quite injury 

Recording: (9857/ 10721) 
i think so i think so um it is it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off you know i do not mean it is by any stretch that it is a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (9858/ 10721) 
definite ideas about it putting everything 

Recording: (9859/ 10721) 
you were you were here for a reason and you were here in the united states for a reason of all the tier that you have here do not you think it is time to share some of uh the things the talent and to not necessarily be recognized for those things but you know some some personality is required personality is the way it is but uh to do things without expecting something in return that would be so nice to see that written on magazine front oh yeah 

Recording: (9860/ 10721) 
you know because when you are overseas it is a different environment 

Recording: (9861/ 10721) 
oh i take the little ladies i take the church 

Recording: (9862/ 10721) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal team and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen you know ugh okay eleven twelve is like who you 

Recording: (9863/ 10721) 
there is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but you know you it is like identification thing you know 

Recording: (9864/ 10721) 
my mother is go in and get what you want and get back out you know and 

Recording: (9865/ 10721) 
no i thought my son 

Recording: (9866/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9867/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9868/ 10721) 
i should have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for money or previously done work for me or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money i have been favor of that i for the good system by which do things i said let you you go do those things i said i want to make money off of your efforts yeah that so 

Recording: (9869/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9870/ 10721) 
umhum ah yeah you you know well you can see it here i mean you uh see some nineteen year old or eighteen year old uh or grouder or whatever you know and see the difference in the maturity you know of of a another couple three different people and everything uh i do not know whether me coming from like a rural area you know the answers and everything uh i think it maybe has something to do with that even his day you know you are more 

Recording: (9871/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9872/ 10721) 
and my own civilian terms i said why would you want to give up an original you know why would you want to give up an original and have a copy because always the other is one i do not know the well in other words you can follow christianity 

Recording: (9873/ 10721) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (9874/ 10721) 
the same thing you know i think they are terrific for the right things yeah 

Recording: (9875/ 10721) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important who wants to be called great if he does not that is a 

Recording: (9876/ 10721) 
as much probably 

Recording: (9877/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (9878/ 10721) 
and then but the whole band and the cheerleers went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart wrench 

Recording: (9879/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9880/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9881/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (9882/ 10721) 
yeah uh the second thing would be uh the um cultural activities that we have um i am wexner center would be one of my primary ones because there is so much going on down there but the art museum and um uh oh right that cultural art center and columbus music hall i mean there is just a million things 

Recording: (9883/ 10721) 
so umhum my uh to me the thing that hurt me the most at it is they want to put caps on our salaries so i am at the high this scale i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to until unless i move into supervision or something up in the and i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are going to put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am 

Recording: (9884/ 10721) 
it is good money yeah um one idea that i just had recently is medical and from addison which is a person who has an md and does computers and so does my too many interests i thought doing both would be really cool 

Recording: (9885/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9886/ 10721) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (9887/ 10721) 
but you are working now janet 

Recording: (9888/ 10721) 
whatever you will not get away with 

Recording: (9889/ 10721) 
like the continent 

Recording: (9890/ 10721) 
ex really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (9891/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (9892/ 10721) 
uh college without the tuition 

Recording: (9893/ 10721) 
and then uh after so long a time after i do not know how long they again the powers will be said well will fool them will fog up that whole area with smoke 

Recording: (9894/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9895/ 10721) 
they they definitely struggle it they do i i think to be that high up obviously you are gonna come in contact with powerful people rich people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than they are volicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (9896/ 10721) 
he misses and hits my window it is a flex bob yeah 

Recording: (9897/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9898/ 10721) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (9899/ 10721) 
stuff everyday there was a new twist on the story that where they now the news was that there was not a news twist yeah i do not care but you could not turn it off because that is all that was on 

Recording: (9900/ 10721) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how he is he is learned let us say he knows more than most kindergartners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and i you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer 

Recording: (9901/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9902/ 10721) 
uh and at least it gave you a lot different few 

Recording: (9903/ 10721) 
you know and and it is just i think that not happen so often there is so many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you are talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (9904/ 10721) 
be in turned away 

Recording: (9905/ 10721) 
i am not real big on the denomination because i think that i think that is sort of goes against what the original intent of of christianity was i i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and the denomination are are just are are just yeah i do not i do not like them  

Recording: (9906/ 10721) 
yeah but my oldest she is the oldest um she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees um um and then they got two other girls and they live together they got a house you know they are on they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got a older 

Recording: (9907/ 10721) 
at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would moved to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so it is such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it uh and if they do not pull their scores up uh they will you know 

Recording: (9908/ 10721) 
yeah and uh she is adorable 

Recording: (9909/ 10721) 
at um i think it was mount crime while we went over the weekend and we went there saturday morning and i have got this forty five minute all through sound tape of the baby which is cute because you can only see parts of it but you can really you can see its face you can see what it looks like and everything but i said i do not want to know the socks and it is so hard to because we are looking of course we are going through this tape try to see if we can see anything and you just you just can not tell i think she was real careful to make sure that that we would not be able to she said i know what it is but i said all right well do not do not tell us so so now 

Recording: (9910/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (9911/ 10721) 
they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this stick and it was only about painting 

Recording: (9912/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9913/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (9914/ 10721) 
i do that every once in a while i just like when i get bored 

Recording: (9915/ 10721) 
they actually offered an early retirement because the funds i do not you may not remember about three years ago four years ago the the federal government was not going to pass a budget so when that does not happen on budget after we cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that which is actually more money than they were gonna give us before that uh so they had to do they would have to lay off people or offer retirement so i took the retirement 

Recording: (9916/ 10721) 
or then they had to after that they had to lottery number and that was not but they were you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what should be worse knowing that you are going to get a nose or something being able prepare for it or uh because i have had friends that gotten uh numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my gosh so 

Recording: (9917/ 10721) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (9918/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9919/ 10721) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dallas to you i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourists like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked 

Recording: (9920/ 10721) 
i do not really remember october if that  

Recording: (9921/ 10721) 
 kind of yeah um actually with this case i do know what happened to the father i can not even move into colorado  um 

Recording: (9922/ 10721) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (9923/ 10721) 
well one thing you know being uh uh i came from basically poor poor uh uh lifestyle early life and everything you know so uh uh if anything i guess that kind of made me negative uh towards people that had influence and had money and did not do anything good with so you know i am a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what i agree with but you know that is i would be 

Recording: (9924/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9925/ 10721) 
yeah

in a strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (9927/ 10721) 
pretty well they are 

Recording: (9928/ 10721) 
 especially well you know we try to just see it at five in the morning  

Recording: (9929/ 10721)

Recording: (9930/ 10721) 
and they would ask you know can i do this can i use this uh kids now if i take my phone off and late on my desk kids will walk right up and just take it they will not ask me uh there is uh oh and then they show pushing but does your phone like uh if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you would not like it much would you 

Recording: (9931/ 10721) 
you can not explain that and those have been questions that i have been asked by my our children well how do you my mom do oh gee how do you how do you but the thing is do you want to make it work 

Recording: (9932/ 10721) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (9933/ 10721) 
and i was born in new york 

Recording: (9934/ 10721) 
i do not put up with anyone is crap but long driving long distances is not good for me focusing concentrate uh and and i i have had you know several accidents several tickets um so i mean i have even had uh you know to other head injuries 

Recording: (9935/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9936/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah and uh you know i i would always use it as a technology when to bed and but i think that that is a a lot of the main problems really 

Recording: (9937/ 10721) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some there was yeah influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (9938/ 10721) 
and then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9939/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9940/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9941/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9942/ 10721) 
and uh she said well mary just well go out and get a job she does not need to be sit around here 

Recording: (9943/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9944/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (9945/ 10721) 
uhhuh uhhuh 

Recording: (9946/ 10721) 
i can not see a lot of substance uh he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then sort of back as a not really backdraft it is just like it is not anything really firm i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what the points they wanted to make i do not hear that coming from bush 

Recording: (9947/ 10721) 
um i am i have lived in columbus my entire life thirty four years um born place on the west side of columbus um 

Recording: (9948/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah i do not feel that i do not feel i do not feel like i fit in with the teenagers anymore either uhhuh 

Recording: (9949/ 10721) 
he was lucky 

Recording: (9950/ 10721) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a little if you are exch hours for money or time for money then you have a fine amount of time and that is 

Recording: (9951/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9952/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9953/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9954/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (9955/ 10721) 
i do because they were not you know they were not in their children is lives enough you know they were not talking about things being open about things and dinner you know and finding out about school um i you can not plan them for having a side on the internet not too many parents would know that that they their kids you know um but no i think i i put the blame on the parents 

Recording: (9956/ 10721) 
and i guess he is still going to build it so 

Recording: (9957/ 10721) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (9958/ 10721) 
that is that is yeah it is developments because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some experts that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance does not take over until about age eight 

Recording: (9959/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (9960/ 10721) 
not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was living there ten years before she married and uh got involved in a youth group and i think that that was very influential on her decision and so she was not married in the church all my other children were but you know she is she is going her own path and that is fine with me she is very good girl i am she is very conscientious and 

Recording: (9961/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9962/ 10721) 
it is just out of control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they can be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (9963/ 10721) 
it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did 

Recording: (9964/ 10721) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it is i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer uh and i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is and i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be disely um i i i do not know it is it is often and i mean your daughter is there is daughters yeah 

Recording: (9965/ 10721) 
oh the japanese come too 

Recording: (9966/ 10721) 
why would you only you said you were in third world why would you only live in third world i would been i would not want this this country has a lot of problems it is just like my family has a lot of problems why would i am believe in  why do not we work with it and correct it because when i run away from it you know what i am doing i am running into another chaos at the other end someone has come the other direction and they had not resolved things and that is been happening our society we have not sat down to learn and understand one another the other uh uh churches um i am just having a few grandchildren my husband just graduated from eight churches quite a few years ago uhhuh yeah 

Recording: (9967/ 10721) 
we sat there then for oh and it was kind of funny we were uh there is another guy and i and i mean the ten out here was uh forward observer we are going out to uh forward observation pollution they uh absolutely lived here that is what i raised a potato was was guiding he was in ones he had to us and we were following him and of course we just had these little 

Recording: (9968/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9969/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9970/ 10721) 
like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so it is kind of interesting i mean i think it is also i like the urban is fall of columbus how um the just the suburbs develop and how it is more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that is really big like our like columbus is downtown and it it is really odd too i mean every there is nothing to do down there it it is all businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean there is like 

Recording: (9971/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (9972/ 10721) 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took him a while to catch on to things 

Recording: (9973/ 10721) 
oh sure you can not get together really just felt like just to only on uh a rate of okay  well at least you are on it is about it you know  uhhuh 

Recording: (9974/ 10721) 
uh yeah there is you know our shop only has about five people out of twenty maybe that have been here over ten years probably a lot of turn over a lot of people will go on to management positions and or leave or but once you have got twenty years and it is like you can not leave now and i am like 

Recording: (9975/ 10721) 
there is lots of of uh theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants  

Recording: (9976/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9977/ 10721) 
faring away  

Recording: (9978/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9979/ 10721) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (9980/ 10721) 
um you just i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say you know we we want to give you this option we very prefer you do not do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 

Recording: (9981/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9982/ 10721) 
 really 

Recording: (9983/ 10721)

and not the you know all that went on in you know in new york the fast pace 

Recording: (9991/ 10721) 
that with the costa and is it the costa or is it the once it is a very material society right now but it is also a very um good economical time too stock market overall is been up i know it is down right now but overall so the money is been flying and houses and building umhum and

Recording: (10023/ 10721) 
oh right 

Recording: (10024/ 10721)

Recording: (10033/ 10721) 
there is a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they are miserable 

Recording: (10034/ 10721) 
yeah it is uh you can if you are if you can not go to a girls dorm until i think maybe the afternoon i think maybe eleven i am not sure uh but you have to be out by a certain time uh it is not as bad as like malone i do not know if you have heard about malone they have like certain days so it is not like that but it is still just a pain and 

Recording: (10035/ 10721) 
we have uh yeah we 

Recording: (10036/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10037/ 10721) 
i feel like there is no there is not a lot you really can really do with that 

Recording: (10038/ 10721) 
i think the ladder i do not think will make any difference the kids that i know in junior high and in in you know college uh it just does not make any difference to them and they do not like those classes they think they are boring they think it has no relevance to their life 

Recording: (10039/ 10721) 
i exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home back in high school and i was too busy with college prep and you know what good did that do me   ah 

Recording: (10040/ 10721) 
i am going out there like this and i am freaking towards i swear  but there is kids out there always cutting 

Recording: (10041/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10042/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10043/ 10721) 
putting together a network itself and we had a you think of a party line system what they used to call daisy chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get onto a data network and we got down to the point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had a kid pipe um 

Recording: (10044/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (10045/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10046/ 10721) 
and so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of india was just flat as this table almost for an area back from the mid italian back probably ten miles there is ten or twelve months yeah long and the coast long and uh so we we had enough area to 

Recording: (10047/ 10721) 
no because i am sure there are gay boys that are not know what is going on with themselves that are in school and and i i have never really understood i i never really understood if they were born like that or i i am just never really understood that to tell you truth  so so i would not you know i would just i if i was a teacher i would just talk to talk to them and you know tell them to do whatever 

Recording: (10048/ 10721) 
clumbus umhum i went to i ended up in an alternative school system all along i was i got into the lottery they used i i i made it into every school i applied for 

Recording: (10049/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10050/ 10721) 
no she she still was down here my other sister has two nieces and my nephew 

Recording: (10051/ 10721) 
so that was fun  yeah 

Recording: (10052/ 10721) 
it is not the exact same as the class was in the marxist sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are i am not going to be able to get a job that is going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative cover i mean in in real terms and things i think are 

Recording: (10053/ 10721) 
difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (10054/ 10721) 
 you have  

Recording: (10055/ 10721) 
high school marijuana acid mushrooms 

Recording: (10056/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (10057/ 10721) 
well i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your land lady and then the wood it will be it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to i was thinking she was going to move that when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bond line is i i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i can afford to hang onto those because the rent just makes the payment but 

Recording: (10058/ 10721) 
uh the area i live in is uh now is the west gate area uh we grew up on the hilltop area but i now live in the west gate which is a little further west 

Recording: (10059/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10060/ 10721) 
stuff at christmas but it is not so much you know and and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there there is not that at all i mean at least in you know my experience there and i mean i can not imagine because you know western europe i think is sort of as much like america is you can get probably you know most places elsewhere in in the world and i mean that would have been a fantastic experience they had three 

Recording: (10061/ 10721) 
it is not gonna work 

Recording: (10062/ 10721) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch i i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (10063/ 10721) 
that is good 

Recording: (10064/ 10721) 
they 

Recording: (10065/ 10721) 
because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (10066/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10067/ 10721) 
it is not it is unifying and i just wish they but i guess there is a rule out there i have asked uh abc news why they can not promote the uh these uh you know they they showed the restaurant and here here is their great point average engineering major fine tell what the majors are tell what these kids are what they plan doing they are not all going to make it to professionals then what to do do afterwards they get token jobs because of connections 

Recording: (10068/ 10721) 
but they would not you know because my daughter was like um a real lovely out going you know people person and she got by with so much gonna it she is you know worked it is worked out fine with her  with both of them actually 

Recording: (10069/ 10721) 
because i they feel they have the need for it there is so many golfers i mean that sports went god i mean when uh my mom used to play golf growing up and they only let the on the golf course is one day a week which is amazing it was like on a tuesday and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought they are only allowed women one day a week you know is not that amazing there is so many good women golfers now and but they said they are too slow and they always talk and and that just killed me when my mom that is the only day 

Recording: (10070/ 10721) 
actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learned disabilities without the eighty eighty and some have eighty eighty without the learning disability and some have both and you can have eighty d without having the hyperactive part you can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hyperpo activity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of out of touch with the reality and they are 

Recording: (10071/ 10721) 
now i am like i am like depressed  it is like man i guess so i guess a few months here you know and it just gets you know it is like when it gets like that i have not decided how because i heard like you know there is some people saying well you know if you want to be like a you you can even like do uh teaching over there like teaching english or you can be yeah nanny it is like so you know it is like if i you know the right right right position that opens up i may not be be coming back anytime soon really 

Recording: (10072/ 10721) 
it is down the hill kind of by the horse yeah yeah so that is where we go and i do not have a student idea so i just sneak in but it is the summer they do not even care they never 

Recording: (10073/ 10721) 
it did okay it is still around it just did not do as good as i thought it was going to do dumb more on us what idiot does not put a three and a half drive on a computer that was stupid that was just dumb i was dumb marketing umhum yeah uhhuh yeah 

Recording: (10074/ 10721) 
but he is also like i said he is got five kids they live in low income housing they are collecting welfare 

Recording: (10075/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10076/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10077/ 10721) 
for the profit and i do that there myself but that also means that i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile so but anyhow i am always saying when it is but then i always will find another project so and i rehab houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that so 

Recording: (10078/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (10079/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10080/ 10721)

Recording: (10082/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10083/ 10721) 
that kind of stuff so it was mostly like what we would do was we would talk about we talk about like medication like as far as while you are in labor 

Recording: (10084/ 10721) 
or anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sort of make known to them but not something that i would really put huh 

Recording: (10085/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10086/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10087/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (10088/ 10721) 
no no i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes it is the parents it is the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before before the health glass did but if the parent is not going to get there it is the only way they are ever going to find out 

Recording: (10089/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10090/ 10721) 
it was really great i mean it is just nice laid back country setting and you do not have to worry about that much crime while your horse might get taken in not yet but i do not have any horses  

Recording: (10091/ 10721)

Recording: (10095/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10096/ 10721) 
right right and i think there is uh you know there is so many small communities like even though oh issue is really a obviously it is own it is own low community and then you have got you know double it and they have got uh the wrong parades and the wrong different things so i agree i mean i think that that there really is a lot of things to do in uh an individual area that i can not see somebody from double and going over to the west side to to do it you you know and i i do not and then maybe also i i feel safer where i live too and and that is something that is an issue for me i know 

Recording: (10097/ 10721) 
but you know it is a very unstructured and nonstructured environment which my son went to work in and they do not have sports but these kids get scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and we are talking big money scholarship school scholarships so if they are able to do it there at that one school you know they could 

Recording: (10098/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10099/ 10721) 
but that economy is coming along too and i mean it it it will be it is developing itself which is which is nice i took it to where we uh a plant on there because my my a mild man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the quote of like seven bucks a day but they get they get boston to work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because their 

Recording: (10100/ 10721) 
it you know 

Recording: (10101/ 10721)

Recording: (10102/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10103/ 10721)

i used to fish and stuff like that but i have had skin cancer i have had four heart attacks and if you look at my skin nice you know blisters and stuff are not 

Recording: (10112/ 10721) 
yeah uh to me that is sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done it that the kid did and you do not want them to do it again and let it go they are suspended and i do not know i am going to probably say this i got this version of this story from the clumbus to spatch so it is probably not the whole story yeah it does 

Recording: (10113/ 10721)

Recording: (10117/ 10721) 
you know the uh i mean my personally i personally would not care you know as long as uh if i was in a box or somebody i could care less whether he would care or not you know  huh you know they do not help me out if i was in trouble so 

Recording: (10118/ 10721)

Recording: (10120/ 10721) 
i am a freelance artist um a illustrated um in fact um marketing communications for a high state is one is one of my big clients and but um uh i also i also have various part time jobs with the medical insurance

Recording: (10122/ 10721) 
your kid would be thrown in jail you would be getting sued for not having insurance 

Recording: (10123/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10124/ 10721) 
there is a mild fear it seems that cops always 

Recording: (10125/ 10721) 
you can be an independent 

Recording: (10126/ 10721) 
she works she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that and that is a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there so many different factors there you know it she says it is so hard to see somebody thirty years old and they come in and they have a pres cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says you know two or three times a week you know your your heart just drops out because you see 

Recording: (10127/ 10721) 
and i do not know whether owned it or not he is never said anything but uh i think my attitude would be uh do not tell them you know uh the the guys that come out very vocifers and 

Recording: (10128/ 10721) 
yeah that was it that is hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you just went wow what what were those people thinking umhum yeah 

Recording: (10129/ 10721) 
it is like if we if america you know we are we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country it is just kind of like you might want to get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know seeing kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (10130/ 10721) 
he will be yeah it is a week from sunday 

Recording: (10131/ 10721) 
i have a social worker umhum um i had a social worker um you know the whole time they might you know do things different now though but you are supposed to have a case worker 

Recording: (10132/ 10721) 
you know at penney is or some place at them all you know and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home i go what did they say you know about and she goes julina is that you and i go see you clean up really nice i said you know you have the best shape you are ever going to have your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes these sackgy pants i said you know when you get when you get your fifties and you have got a gut and a big ass you know you could do that 

Recording: (10133/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (10134/ 10721) 
bring this attitude to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you is they will put you over here in let us say a man is jury jury position which you we do not have any call for but you are there because of the money only okay so we are trying to fit the attitude to the person and compensate them accordingly which hey i think we did that we probably have more teachers 

Recording: (10135/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10136/ 10721) 
to be close so i did not have to drive  

Recording: (10137/ 10721) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you are i mean kids like that i could see if they are in a poor in harland or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood and a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children their son was doing 

Recording: (10138/ 10721) 
because i like johnson better if you really want to know but there are many places i fish up there um 

Recording: (10139/ 10721) 
and then they said an after you get your master is you will definitely need your doctorate well you know the people saying this are college people they are colleges of business uh it takes a while to realize that if you can get in and get that education on grant money in scholarships that is that is good but then even now being a person with uh some odd disability from the brain injury uh i mean i do not even like to call it 

Recording: (10140/ 10721) 
it is an island but it planned it together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show the show and this happened with deep space nine too and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspect of the stories do not really appealed to me very much uh i am more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but uh yeah 

Recording: (10141/ 10721) 
well the humans has started it and the man narrating the thing said there was not a single animal that they profileed in the thing that uh uh um behave the way it did on its own accord 

Recording: (10142/ 10721) 
well i do not

Recording: (10156/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i think it was just a political thing 

Recording: (10157/ 10721) 
and we would uh adjust the guns called down shifts till they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (10158/ 10721) 
i would think it would be cheaper organic food 

Recording: (10159/ 10721) 
well he told a jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the holly cost went to hell because they were jewish 

Recording: (10160/ 10721)

they are just fine to go on strike anytime they want to however how they behave during the strike was just disgusting i mean 

Recording: (10166/ 10721) 
umhum but you know when you first came here he said that you could not win here because you had too many slow white guys so 

Recording: (10167/ 10721) 
but that is you know that is a sign that that not only are we doing the dumbing down of jobs 

Recording: (10168/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10169/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (10170/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (10171/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (10172/ 10721)

Recording: (10183/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (10184/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10185/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10186/ 10721) 
committment you know can not just be a roommate  

Recording: (10187/ 10721) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things that i ran into architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (10188/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10189/ 10721) 
painfully clear that when that she should not plan on having a career because that she is going to have to raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my belief and and the fact that it is like the males telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think an individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i am concerned about a a uh yeah well 

Recording: (10190/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10191/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (10192/ 10721)

teachers and english teachers are really good um 

Recording: (10197/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10198/ 10721) 
car accident i would say about ten years ago 

Recording: (10199/ 10721) 
i do not know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it is just necessary  

Recording: (10200/ 10721) 
well we figure in a few years he will um 

Recording: (10201/ 10721) 
umhum uh they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it and most usually i just put location i do not want to go certain places uh 

Recording: (10202/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (10203/ 10721) 
yeah you you can not have a beer gun and a big ass and it means you are it means you are sloppy and lazy if you do but if a man does it is like my god he is probably got some power behind i mean him it is like uh he is probably just as lazy as anybody else it is like you know uh you know i hate to see girls starve of themselves to death you know it is like uh you know they are certain sometimes your life where you are going to be fat you know you know my my youngest daughter has a problem with that you know she is i do not know why she is so insecure because she out of the four of us including 

Recording: (10204/ 10721) 
yeah like when i need things and i call them up i need diapers and i have wiped any twenty dollars yeah he is there for me for that financially yeah he is always been there for me 

Recording: (10205/ 10721) 
yeah plus a lot of work stress that she is had and stuff 

Recording: (10206/ 10721) 
but i mean if you get to the point where where there is not then you just have to i do not know i think you have to be in the situation in my situation i think for my parents it is better that they split up because they are both very happy now 

Recording: (10207/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10208/ 10721) 
everybody needs to know that information 

Recording: (10209/ 10721) 
i defending my stepfather yeah against the rest of my family immediately falling my father is death because there was uh some bittersness between the rest of my family and my stepmother so my sister and i defending my step mother against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shifted us and so stepmother is evil 

Recording: (10210/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10211/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (10212/ 10721) 
could not spend a week there with you so you know i hope that does not happen but i have heard friends say you know their thirteen year olds just rolled over from one to yeah they are you know from the best kid and town to you know i am running away i am never going to school again so it is tough any wonder what causes that yeah yeah is it the you know where where would you go wrong you know somebody needs to figure it out um 

Recording: (10213/ 10721) 
how about 

Recording: (10214/ 10721) 
high on their horse yeah  some of them are too 

Recording: (10215/ 10721) 
improvement in three months and all that kind of it was image and we were saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better um we learn to say the negative is in a positive way and that is important you know and you need to get that that you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservative you know they want they want peace  

Recording: (10216/ 10721) 
and it would take for like years i would think to implement the program successfully 

Recording: (10217/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (10218/ 10721) 
now this most of my paintings were completed uh before uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before it came back out it was more the thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it is suddenly uh you hear about it more often so that is not a little funny about it used to be probably paint star wars 

Recording: (10219/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10220/ 10721) 
you learn a heck of a lot from that uh aging person a heck of a lot more than you would through interviewing me really 

Recording: (10221/ 10721) 
no umhum 

Recording: (10222/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10223/ 10721) 
we have not talked about adopting the baby but our age 

Recording: (10224/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (10225/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10226/ 10721) 
yeah i want to take up a couple of music courses and you know get a little further on that better my education and what it already is i do not consider myself the dumbest person but i know i am not the smarter 

Recording: (10227/ 10721) 
i did not quite understand here who are you 

Recording: (10228/ 10721) 
um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

Recording: (10229/ 10721) 
so i took him downstairs and paddled him i have never been anything more said about it since then 

Recording: (10230/ 10721) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular so we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixties sound like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we have got these sounds 

Recording: (10231/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (10232/ 10721) 
but and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (10233/ 10721) 
you are talking to people all over the country i mean you are becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world 

Recording: (10234/ 10721) 
so he is not so crazy she was doing this thing where um if he did a good job on something she would give him like a fake coin they put it in a little bank and at the end of the week or something he could cash and then get a video or a video game or something you know that shows responsibility too but 

Recording: (10235/ 10721) 
very often i mean maybe like there is like one or two that come during the year 

Recording: (10236/ 10721) 
and then i got here and i do not i do not care  yeah 

Recording: (10237/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (10238/ 10721) 
i i do not think so in new york it might be i am like i say it is a lot more competitive there here i think i think columbus is in the midwest in general i think is much more umhum 

Recording: (10239/ 10721) 
whether it is over exaggerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own a fire arm but we played with guns and played cow to all these so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (10240/ 10721) 
and i just can not imagine i had dogs and cats we did and i loved it and i just think kids need that and it is just a different kind of love i think you know they learn from it and 

Recording: (10241/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10242/ 10721) 
they are usually going to get a lot of date 

Recording: (10243/ 10721) 
i like that yeah 

Recording: (10244/ 10721) 
looking like god man you pack just imagine this little six year old walking into the store packing  uh oh man 

Recording: (10245/ 10721)

Recording: (10246/ 10721) 
hom uh sexuality i guess 

Recording: (10247/ 10721) 
uh and if we find out she is not doing her work this is very different perspective 

Recording: (10248/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (10249/ 10721)

Recording: (10250/ 10721) 
so i became a business major 

Recording: (10251/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10252/ 10721) 
and if i was in the same situation i would be doing the same thing so 

Recording: (10253/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (10254/ 10721) 
definitely 

Recording: (10255/ 10721) 
uh not as much as i used to be when i was younger used to be die hard but not anymore you know umhum yeah by their standards but they still were six or six you know and they probably could have one maybe a couple more games but that is about it you know really

Recording: (10265/ 10721) 
i was born in brooklyn new york 

Recording: (10266/ 10721) 
there is literally you know hundreds of library publications uh and it is a problem is their libraries are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (10267/ 10721) 
now like i say i do not i do not believe that homosexuality is taught um i think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be just fine

i know crash or anything but with rather scared  kind of shaken up why it but um no they are very very serious about does not need a driver is 

Recording: (10269/ 10721) 
the big things 

Recording: (10270/ 10721) 
but there were one or two eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put hours worth of research into and then sketch and i mean it was just 

Recording: (10271/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (10272/ 10721) 
and uh maybe that is why you know it is like that but 

Recording: (10273/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10274/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10275/ 10721) 
right yeah 

Recording: (10276/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10277/ 10721) 
but it is a uh smaller basic school you know in say well so 

Recording: (10278/ 10721) 
yeah that that is one of the drawbacks 

Recording: (10279/ 10721) 
if not you just get there the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (10280/ 10721) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know  

Recording: (10281/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10282/ 10721) 
just because you know who was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the textbook that they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notes like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um so i think it it is uh when people have real enthusiasm and like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not the 

Recording: (10283/ 10721) 
a condominium or something one floor plan

Recording: (10301/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10302/ 10721) 
well according to the government she would have 

Recording: (10303/ 10721) 
and of course i think too as in america the uh the farm families you know they wanted that was more labor than the than your so to so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it it uh it just made sense to me in fact it looks like a my family that there is going to the children are going to be mostly in twos you know not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are 

Recording: (10304/ 10721)

Recording: (10311/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10312/ 10721)

Recording: (10347/ 10721) 
oh okay

well i do not really like the i do not i like i really do not like that job but uh you know i like the people there but it is like uh way too busy i think 

Recording: (10355/ 10721) 
so it is tough 

Recording: (10356/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10357/ 10721) 
no unfortunately not  

Recording: (10358/ 10721)

Recording: (10362/ 10721) 
i am like i do not think so yeah grading is 

Recording: (10363/ 10721) 
yeah i yeah and i do computer processing mostly but you know i i work from ten at night until eight in the morning so 

Recording: (10364/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (10365/ 10721) 
no it is not 

Recording: (10366/ 10721) 
and why do not people use their time you know and it is free you know rather they get all ten stuff and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out uh their way because they got to get there you know 

Recording: (10367/ 10721) 
you never forfitted that you never gave me that right so that is why i feel like i could never want that in it to kill another person 

Recording: (10368/ 10721) 
in a way yeah i think that would be good yeah maybe a new name 

Recording: (10369/ 10721) 
and i like painting 

Recording: (10370/ 10721) 
he is had to be no no he is not but um he and i uh he and i hung out a lot and you know i knew the one of the two things that is going to happen i was going to follow him and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind doing them every time i would doing every time i would have done them i would have known they were wrong or i was going to the opposite direction and i went the opposite direction i got plugged in with uh some christian groups on campus made some christian friends and hung out with them and and 

Recording: (10371/ 10721) 
you do not slide as much 

Recording: (10372/ 10721) 
she helped a lot 

Recording: (10373/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (10374/ 10721) 
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service 

Recording: (10375/ 10721) 
um i helped them set up different things helped them you know clean them up afterwards prepations all kinds of different things there was a lot of blood and stuff i do not know when you when it is not you it seems a little easier to observe i guess when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning to you i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and you hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know 

Recording: (10376/ 10721) 
people who are notorbats because i think if you grow up like in a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught uh i think a lot of the you know we do not drink alcohol we do not there is a lot of restrictions i guess you would call them restrictions but they are i feel like there were not just health codes that just keep you healthy and so um it might be it is 

Recording: (10377/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10378/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (10379/ 10721) 
now i mean if you saw it was writing you would think a cave man wrote it it looks like higher glifics or something but i want something done with my printers or my computers i just go hey umhum 

Recording: (10380/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah it is an old an old eyesore that they should have got rid of years ago but 

Recording: (10381/ 10721) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parents were not there and they had to clean they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know with kids a lot of them who will have when they have parents have money and 

Recording: (10382/ 10721) 
no not really i do not know what even is to eat down here obviously is 

Recording: (10383/ 10721) 
a two hundred thousand dollar house in everywhere around me and he 

Recording: (10384/ 10721) 
and those the the other students are lost to the system and that is what happened with him 

Recording: (10385/ 10721) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools on that issue and yeah it i agree with the gambling thing you know just as long as it is like social drinking  and in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i i bought a one dollars lottery ticket won three bucks off of it so 

Recording: (10386/ 10721) 
uhhuh right there 

Recording: (10387/ 10721) 
and uh it it is great we have been re engineered the last eight years old out downizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the lan the person brings as opposed to uh one of the problems we see as an as an employer or at least as supervisor manager and a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this and order go up there they do not take the consideration the attitudes the person has and so now we are saying okay have you bring 

Recording: (10388/ 10721) 
uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know i i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh bonana and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (10389/ 10721) 
wow i mean 

Recording: (10390/ 10721) 
week end in jail or something but eighteen of them and you are racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (10391/ 10721) 
in some ways i like it and some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is relatively safe place to live although that is coming from i mean i have been robbed at gun point or nice point about four times i think in columbus yeah maybe five um i drove a taxi cab for a couple of summers and i was robbed i think twice driving the cab 

Recording: (10392/ 10721) 
yes yes you might make millions you could retire young really 

Recording: (10393/ 10721) 
or northland 

Recording: (10394/ 10721) 
and dug out the door it under it 

Recording: (10395/ 10721) 
peddling but uh 

Recording: (10396/ 10721) 
 or just thousands is enough he did not have to have millions  

Recording: (10397/ 10721) 
huh  

Recording: (10398/ 10721) 
when you are fifty five or or is it sixty two whatever age is it age limitation age or you based what age you are disability or being out of town uh you are allowed so routinely we have uh done the out of i mean done the uh absentee over the years no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have uh i think the vast majority uh are truly good honest people they try to mean well 

Recording: (10399/ 10721) 
short uh essay for for a test and uh but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know it would come up with a rubbock and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things  yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher who is had to assign or grade creative writing  i am not sure i would know how to do that yeah  

Recording: (10400/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10401/ 10721) 
town with the 

Recording: (10402/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10403/ 10721) 
oh is not that cute 

Recording: (10404/ 10721) 
um i mean i i mean i could see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to a better use of some sort if they did the same kind of thing things 

Recording: (10405/ 10721) 
and he and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough to bring the start out because he was behind and 

Recording: (10406/ 10721) 
yeah i do not think uh i do not think there should be any more uh new developments just yet you know just the kind of weed out a little bit of the population for one part of the population and this neighborhood and you know just pretty much divide it off so it is not to uh not too crowded one place and then not too vacant other places 

Recording: (10407/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10408/ 10721) 
i have no idea it is kind of like picking the the least of evils 

Recording: (10409/ 10721) 
and  and 

Recording: (10410/ 10721) 
no he they did not even come i mean he came out but it is like he went the other way i thought you know he you kick it if he get a big kick out of kicking much can you but you know then

Recording: (10413/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10414/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10415/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10416/ 10721) 
you want to know where i was born 

Recording: (10417/ 10721) 
yeah talking about all these under age kids thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen even up to eighteen years old to column by shooting i mean all those just relate in one category that you know it is getting out of control here they will do something

so 

Recording: (10425/ 10721) 
and and the data they collect is just i mean well i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basics data is essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself but 

Recording: (10426/ 10721) 
yeah it is not like there is a face behind like the music but not so much too you know it is not like

Recording: (10485/ 10721) 
we were on the like each person would be on a team of these kids would be assigned to these kids and you would go to your team meetings and the doctors the shrinks would go well i mean i got t winx off at christmas you know they would be bitching in moment about the fact that that we got time off and they did not and i finally came up with the perfect thing when coming i said well doctor simpson or whatever his name was doctor brown you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off

Recording: (10518/ 10721) 
you are adopted by two dads i mean i mean that is a lot it is it is difficult to adopt children i mean and it should be and so the children they would likely take would be trouble to begin with 

Recording: (10519/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10520/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah we do a lot of it our library learned too 

Recording: (10521/ 10721)

Recording: (10526/ 10721) 
i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but uh if if that was the relationship for everybody

Recording: (10613/ 10721) 
yeah  

Recording: (10614/ 10721) 
how they are going how they are going to uh make sure that the walk is on again i mean it just seems like they are wasting money to me all you are doing is getting letting uh a company sell a a trigger lock for a gun or and make it make the guy make somebody have to buy one you know i got to make him put it on the gun so 

Recording: (10615/ 10721) 
did this in the mid sixties when we drove up that way in the early sixties there was there were fields there were farms there were  uh they were forest you know none of that stuff out there and it is just it is just amazing the urban shrall that is taking over out there 

Recording: (10616/ 10721) 
it goes away about age eight and my kids are still doing it you know they are still or they might make an eight from the bottom up instead of from the top down or six from the bottom up i even had a kid once that made one is from the bottom up you could tell by watching them right that their brain did not work like yours did 

Recording: (10617/ 10721) 
yeah because i have thought about that like well i may i will just wait a few years and start dating 

Recording: (10618/ 10721) 
umhum yeah how appalling oh yeah yeah my my the my mom especially is just like when are you going to stop doing that yeah because he is sixteen months now and i think he is tapering off quite a but so i think that he will be done soon but i am not pushing him so 

Recording: (10619/ 10721) 
well see that is not proved out by the the uh frugal ratings he still has higher approval than reagan had in his last eighteen months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that um that you know people do not like all the crap that went with him is the bundance on tv you know they say that and they are they are still trying to get him i mean before um he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elizabeth dole they would not have been able to attack on the issue so they would find other things to get get 

Recording: (10620/ 10721)

Recording: (10628/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (10629/ 10721) 
i am kind of happy i am not doing that anymore it really takes a certain type of person to work for and that is hard to find in that area so 

Recording: (10630/ 10721) 
no no but that is what i am saying but that that is what i am saying when the same thing is happening when we had a busting we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment oh they they got the taste of it and they went back um oh yeah um and we did an in a very unjust thing to those kids into the families and then when we broke them up we did something else you know took them out we lost that umhum involvement so now the parents can not follow kids their activities uh getting it split up hey we do not want to we do not want to families that is a misnoma they said 

Recording: (10631/ 10721) 
afterwards too and that is one of the things they have asked for in the adoption agreement and the couple is willing to do that 

Recording: (10632/ 10721) 
for arts and communications but it is been more of a problem than it is been a asset um interviewing for jobs people that uh doing the interviewing had just a high school education and uh they are not going to hire me when after a year i would be there  boss  um so a lot of that is out there uh regardless of what people say i am not trying to be pessimistic or negative 

Recording: (10633/ 10721) 
that is 

Recording: (10634/ 10721)

Recording: (10636/ 10721) 
there has been some serious consideration but no there was some a lot someone took up a petition and was virginia to do it but he decided he did not want to devote that much time away from his uh his television program oh he is he is quite a smart fellow i really oh umhum 

Recording: (10637/ 10721) 
yeah archie bunker gets red flintstone area go  i can not really put him in the category four scump because four scump was a great guy 

Recording: (10638/ 10721) 
right right  

Recording: (10639/ 10721) 
it is crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything you know and i have got home i guess they are like just give me a list and somebody is like i want to get this and i want to get that and so it is just it is just been   it is been something else which is which is good though because our family is our pretty similar and they are all 

Recording: (10640/ 10721) 
i do not know where i am going to fly into honestly i am thinking it was between a career flight 

Recording: (10641/ 10721) 
uh technology um i mean like i like living in a world where knowledge puts everything i need at my finger tips um i mean uh i think that it is something that would not have happened had there not been a uh a a highly the highly populous generation suddenly that was competing and within itself 

Recording: (10642/ 10721) 
he said i did not think you stayed up to me i said well you know what the heck you know 

Recording: (10643/ 10721)

Recording: (10653/ 10721) 
makes it difficult it is an adjustment 

Recording: (10654/ 10721) 
the bonding 

Recording: (10655/ 10721) 
i tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (10656/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10657/ 10721) 
well yeah you you care a lot of those  

Recording: (10658/ 10721) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school  starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but   yeah 

Recording: (10659/ 10721) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government telling me what to do 

Recording: (10660/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10661/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (10662/ 10721)

Recording: (10666/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (10667/ 10721) 
well if you do that to ten things that is somebody that is integral to the university is collection that really hits your budget you know and then there is always the professor who wants the particular journal because they like it 

Recording: (10668/ 10721) 
uhhuh yeah 

Recording: (10669/ 10721) 
did not hear about that 

Recording: (10670/ 10721)

Recording: (10671/ 10721) 
to marry them and she moved over and 

Recording: (10672/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (10673/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10674/ 10721) 
yeah and as i got older i continued to lose interest in 

Recording: (10675/ 10721) 
i do not know 

Recording: (10676/ 10721) 
and so 

Recording: (10677/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10678/ 10721) 
yeah i know i know i know 

Recording: (10679/ 10721) 
readers digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level they now write it on the sixth grade level newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level for the general but it is just either we are getting more and more elderly kids that are not learned to read or um kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that well i read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set 

Recording: (10680/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (10681/ 10721) 
do and a half 

Recording: (10682/ 10721) 
that and the people that enjoy you think what are you why are we hiring these guys you know what do they what do they think

she has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (10684/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10685/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is it is jose columbus it is jose columbus uh maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here um do not realize how i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not there is a lot of places it is not but it is uh you know it is not a back water either 

Recording: (10686/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (10687/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10688/ 10721) 
really uhhuh i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (10689/ 10721) 
uh well you have it upstairs and downstairs upstairs is the tower and there is like a uh ground control a clearance delivery which reads all the clearances and all the airplanes and the ground control taxes and to and from the runway and the power works everybody landing and departmenting or any airplane within five mile radios then once they get out of that radios downstairs which is called the approach control they work everything from there to ten thousand feet and out to about sixty miles and when they get to that point then they go to the in route centers 

Recording: (10690/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (10691/ 10721) 
i mean you talk to people in the catholic church about the unscene meaning the spiritual realm and they freak out 

Recording: (10692/ 10721) 
as a metal health problems 

Recording: (10693/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10694/ 10721) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (10695/ 10721) 
um in in trying to stop it um uh i am trying to think of some good examples i mean when politicians and start talking about like biological functions 

Recording: (10696/ 10721) 
no i do not work for politics 

Recording: (10697/ 10721) 
uh it is a high school trip uh she is in eleventh grade 

Recording: (10698/ 10721) 
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right 

Recording: (10699/ 10721) 
it does 

Recording: (10700/ 10721) 
too long or a sentence that is a fragment and it is not a complete thought you are not going to notice that because you know what it was suppose to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them just just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you oh well i had a 

Recording: (10701/ 10721) 
but that is what they go through 

Recording: (10702/ 10721) 
well i did not necessarily want to but that is where my family started me out they um are alternative to the public schools supposedly um just more i do not know exactly how to explain it the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything  

Recording: (10703/ 10721) 
or something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say and you say turn the page three ninety three or and they turned to three thirty nine in their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the 

Recording: (10704/ 10721) 
umhum but that is kind of it it you know kind of came through where they were like uh when i was growing up we had the uh the you know you had your rocks and everything of course you had your uh what you we were called debts you know uh and i was kind of like in the middle you know i played a little bit of pork you know but also associated with them and they were basically potheads you know and everything so uh so like i say i you know i was kind of uh associated 

Recording: (10705/ 10721) 
yeah ohio state is a really good medical school i do not i do not know i think they just mainly did not want to go to usu we like their eagles or something you know i am thinking of one in particular you know rich parents just wanted to go somewhere else 

Recording: (10706/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10707/ 10721) 
yeah yeah they are pretty good where i live uh well last year when we had that really really high snow um i shoveled and then like an hour later there at blue over so it was like what is the point um but our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk 

Recording: (10708/ 10721) 
no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence umhum 

Recording: (10709/ 10721) 
i am going to come up there i said sure drive by  and then i then i could call up and say he will be there in three hours it will be a nice little barbara k seven at this location and get in and so she spent the next two and a half hours canceling classes and stuff 

Recording: (10710/ 10721) 
so it is been a lot of pressure there 

Recording: (10711/ 10721) 
uh the bb is due may thirtieth and graduation is june second 

Recording: (10712/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10713/ 10721) 
yeah you know and you know it is like uh i i honestly feel the older you get the more you kind of look at what is in there as opposed to you know gosh that is just a four hundred dollar dress and a three hundred dollar hair do and you know what does that mean you know it is like uh when we are food for magazines  my feeling is uh some people are going to say gee she had a really big house and so many people are going to go god she did work in this area for free and she volunteered to this and 

Recording: (10714/ 10721) 
they had to and they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay well i said yes but then uh uh when it got into two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a substitute substitute i am getting sixty dollars a day i can not do this unless you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am 

Recording: (10715/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10716/ 10721) 
and it got broken into and uh you know he is paying around on this apartment and he is back home because the police said that this apartment has been hit many times so it is just a big mess right now you know he had uh uh nice uh you know his his better clothes stolen his you know 

Recording: (10717/ 10721) 
now that kids are carrying knives and guns and things to school you never know if you are going to walk into the building and and maybe not go home that day 

Recording: (10718/ 10721) 
uh i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there is no more solicitor groups in the other that i know 

Recording: (10719/ 10721) 
just the number of people that were here 

Recording: (10720/ 10721) 
yeah you know like when i worked in westernville i had bought my house because i used to work um off of the east north broadway and the freeway and uh i thought it was going to be there forever 

Recording: (10721/ 10721) 
yeah we will see where i am at in five years i know everybody is saying well do not you want to go back for your r n i am like after working with r ns and we were doing the same things basically and they did not get paid much more than i did so i was like well what a waste you know go to school for a i have been basically just to learn a few more theories i can come up with my own
