Recording: (1/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. 

Recording: (2/ 10721) 
 Just, you know. 

Recording: (3/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5/ 10721) 
 I think a lot of people don't understand, it's a mindset, they don't want to deal with numbers a lot of people, or they want something easy.  easy and simple.  any term, any definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind. 

Recording: (6/ 10721) 
 high schools, like volunteering at the local senior citizens home or something like that. 

Recording: (7/ 10721) 
 they are identical, then the black woman should get the job. But there is no, to me, the most qualified person should get the job, end of story. That's it.  you know, it's best for society in general. 

Recording: (8/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and then I'll show that son of a gun, I'll shoot him. Like the guys that were supposed to be picking him up. I don't even know where they even shot him.  But yeah, I think they kind of just thought, you know, I'll prove to them that they can't push me around.  you 

Recording: (9/ 10721) 
 It's like a double scene. Like, it's weird. 

Recording: (10/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (11/ 10721) 
 and I knew it had beautiful hardwood floors, building bookcases, and I just knew that I could have seen me wanting that house. Do you know what I mean? It's like that identity thing.  Somebody came through with a realtor and they made me this offer that was real low. It was like $138,000. And the realtor, I'm thinking about it because it was funny, he delivered the  offered him my home and I was gracious and I thanked him and I got inside and I opened up and I saw it and I went running on the porch I said, wait a minute, this is never gonna work. 

Recording: (12/ 10721) 
 Back to bed rest, really. 

Recording: (13/ 10721) 
 I mean it's something he has to deal with, he has to deal with the problems with. 

Recording: (14/ 10721) 
 He is a commercial heating and cooling technician. He works for a major company out in Indianapolis. 

Recording: (15/ 10721) 
 I have no idea. 

Recording: (16/ 10721) 
 No. I pray at night. You know, I don't think he knows what I'm praying to or anything like that. 

Recording: (17/ 10721) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (18/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (19/ 10721) 
 Hehehehehehe 

Recording: (20/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I know. I, you know, I think too, I apologize to my oldest daughter almost every day about the poor thing all I put her through when we were trying to grow up together. And I was 24 when she was born.  I wasn't a child. But it's like you don't have realistic expectations of what children are capable of or what they can do because if they're really verbal, I mean I can  I've talked to them from the moment they were born. Even when they couldn't talk to me, that was irrelevant. I was talking to them the whole time. 

Recording: (21/ 10721) 
 on the spur of the moment. I'd have to think about that. I really would. 

Recording: (22/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (23/ 10721) 
 And he was going to have a group of people work out there. And he said that, you know, I was qualified. Well, when we got out there, it just fell through, you know.  and we all just lived our lives. But I was glad that he got me out there because I adored it. I just loved it out there. 

Recording: (24/ 10721) 
 because the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and at least the daycare, all the stuff they have.  have on their computer is all education stuff. It's not game game. It has a game theme to it, but. 

Recording: (25/ 10721) 
 We're animals. Everyone's looking for leaders. It's the rules of the church. Simple as a rule. 

Recording: (26/ 10721) 
 But now it seems like people are just, like, I don't know why that's a trend. I mean, my dad said he grew up in the Bronx. 

Recording: (27/ 10721) 
 I think that's kind of where I'm coming from Jan, and I know you, Jan, I mean what my sister does, I just say to her, I just really admire it. I can't give as much.  as she gives. I just don't have that same spirit she has, but it's great to see. I mean, she's real. She really, when she  with the people. I don't know I have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and 

Recording: (28/ 10721) 
 I'm the oldest. 

Recording: (29/ 10721) 
 is 

Recording: (30/ 10721) 
 and they're ready to move on again. You just don't get as close to people as you used to. 

Recording: (31/ 10721) 
 and the second tornado. It wasn't as bad. I mean, we was driving up after he ripped me off and he said, well, I'm taking your sorry ass.  back to Columbus and I said okay go for it. I'm just sitting there smiling all the way up, knowing what he didn't know. We get the tennis  see and the weather is kind of bad there too. I'm like, hey man, slow down. You don't have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm. 

Recording: (32/ 10721) 
 It's so corrupt. They have two choices, to stay in it and try or to succumb to all the things. And 90% of them, as you can see, what happened.  in Washington have succumbed. I don't hear any of them raising hell about what really matters in this country. 

Recording: (33/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think a lot of times people aren't real rational as far as who they go for. 

Recording: (34/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (35/ 10721) 
 No. What do you think is wrong with it? With the system? 

Recording: (36/ 10721) 
 Honestly, I can't say it really bothers me too much. I mean as far as just  dealing with gay people or whatever, it doesn't bother me at all. It's just something I don't want to deal with or whatnot. So I mean,  The fact that people of the same sex are living together are married or whatnot, that doesn't bother me. Like I said, it's just more something that...  I love you. 

Recording: (37/ 10721) 
 You know? Yeah. 

Recording: (38/ 10721) 
 Great. 

Recording: (39/ 10721) 
 But when he did have something to do with it, it was kind of strange. They'd go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that. 

Recording: (40/ 10721) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (41/ 10721) 
 My wife and I had been to San Francisco a couple times. The first time was did all the tourist things. And the next time I said, let's just go and wander around.  around and see and spend more time. Both of them are good for different, you know. 

Recording: (42/ 10721) 
 It's Medicare type. 

Recording: (43/ 10721) 
 Here at college I really haven't witnessed any violence at all. 

Recording: (44/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (45/ 10721) 
 I know. 

Recording: (46/ 10721) 
 I mean, that is an 

Recording: (47/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (48/ 10721) 
 I mean, there are people who think cars won't run. 

Recording: (49/ 10721) 
 And of course that never happened. 

Recording: (50/ 10721) 
 It's all up to that human being if they want to change. If they got their mindset on they don't want to be with their other sex, I don't think it can change.  You know, that's all up to that person, I think. 

Recording: (51/ 10721) 
 Oh, well, we really wants to go. He lived in California. That's where that family I told you about was the and when he was 14 or 16 and he really wants to go back.  back. So we'll probably end up there sometime, but after I finish school and after he works for a little while and I work so that we can have enough money  I mean, we don't need to have a ton, but we just should be at least a little out of debt. Yeah, something. 

Recording: (52/ 10721) 
 Yeah. I know. Oh, it gives me goosebumps. It's such a shame. 

Recording: (53/ 10721) 
 Something like that. I don't know much about it. 

Recording: (54/ 10721) 
 And if you know any teenagers, the more strict you make it, the more they rebel. 

Recording: (55/ 10721) 
 with that situation. 

Recording: (56/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (57/ 10721) 
 Well... 

Recording: (58/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (59/ 10721) 
 I was sitting down in my boyfriend's room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone. I had my computer on, but nobody was sitting at it. 

Recording: (60/ 10721) 
 So I, you know, they probably all, hey, you resemble that remark, or you know. 

Recording: (61/ 10721) 
 for me to even think about. 

Recording: (62/ 10721) 
 And then she's the one that I'll be hearing, you know, you don't know what they're like, black ass and all this, you know, they're prejudiced. And all she's doing is yelling about being prejudiced, their prejudice against her.  Well, what she don't understand is that's her damn job. 

Recording: (63/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (64/ 10721) 
 right 

Recording: (65/ 10721) 
 The ultimate would probably be a part-time thing, but neither one of our positions offer any type of part-time work. We have some friends that do that where  they only go two days a week or something, which is, they get a little bit of both the world, so. 

Recording: (66/ 10721) 
 except for their names were changed for these basically made up reasons. 

Recording: (67/ 10721) 
 Well, I guess I'd have to say I don't necessarily like middle school. But see, when you get a special ed certificate, you're certified kindergarten through 12th.  So, I did several years in the high school when I was first out of college. I did high school first, then I went to elementary while my  kids were in elementary so I could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning, you know? And then six years ago I went to the middle school and I've decided that 

Recording: (68/ 10721) 
 They've always been there. I mean, you know, I don't really care what the guy's specific thing is if he's in a box hole with me, you know, and as long as  I think you shoot a gun, huh? You know, I mean, I could care less. I've got gay friends, you know, so. 

Recording: (69/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (70/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (71/ 10721) 
 It really is great. 

Recording: (72/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (73/ 10721) 
 They'll be naked, but they'll still go in with a huge towel on. 

Recording: (74/ 10721) 
 I mean, like, what's his name, who wrote the book? 

Recording: (75/ 10721) 
 which could change. 

Recording: (76/ 10721) 
 Oh my gosh. 

Recording: (77/ 10721) 
 I haven't taken him there yet. 

Recording: (78/ 10721) 
 I think they should. I think a lot of the fear of this material comes from people who hold the belief that  that you choose your orientation, that you can be converted to homosexuality. And I personally don't believe that, so I'm not afraid of it.  But I can see how people would hold the opposite view. And that's where this comes from. But since I think they're wrong, I think I'm going to go with it. 

Recording: (79/ 10721) 
 I'd say it's not any different than having a man. I mean, it's a person. She'd just have a different way of going about it.  Probably. 

Recording: (80/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (81/ 10721) 
 But I'm using me as an example because I've seen a lot of other people do the same thing. Don't get me wrong. 

Recording: (82/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he is. 

Recording: (83/ 10721) 
 I just didn't want to do that. A lot of people do that, but you know, it's just such an investment then when you leave. 

Recording: (84/ 10721) 
 Yeah, or more, I don't even know. It's just such a huge problem and it's gotten so out of hand. It's going to be everybody all together that has to work  It's going to be the teachers and the government and everybody, but they all have to have one common thing. And it cracks me up because we're so concerned about Elion, this  this poor little kid. Everybody knows who he is. But you know, you look at our own kids. We don't even care about our own kids as much as we care. I mean, here's this 

Recording: (85/ 10721) 
 Oh my gosh. 

Recording: (86/ 10721) 
 Her house in India is like this mansion and they have servants there. I mean, it's really impressive. Just the houses are just worth more so you can't  get as much house here. But yeah, everybody's doing well. 

Recording: (87/ 10721) 
 I don't get on it, but I mean, it's there. 

Recording: (88/ 10721) 
 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다. 

Recording: (89/ 10721) 
 That's fine. 

Recording: (90/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (91/ 10721) 
 Not as an individual. Well, I say that's a problem. It's hard to find a balance between censorship and free flow of information.  And as long as people, I mean some people like this information. Jerry Springer is still running.  I actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while. It's kind of interesting to watch these people.  But 

Recording: (92/ 10721) 
 But there are those that are out there that are willing to do that. 

Recording: (93/ 10721) 
 But the more time I have offering, no. 

Recording: (94/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (95/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it wasn't. There we go. 

Recording: (96/ 10721) 
 But you don't really have to work as hard there apparently. 

Recording: (97/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (98/ 10721) 
 I think you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it.  Most kids don't like being on medication because it makes them different. They don't look at it like, gee, I'm really lucky I live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate.  concentrate. They look at it like, well, my friends have to do it, so why do I have to do it? They look at it like it's a big pain because I've got to run over to the nurse and 

Recording: (99/ 10721) 
 You don't use coupons. 

Recording: (100/ 10721) 
 And apparently that's a way of initiating a conversation. One of the guys I usually go clubbing with, he's the one who got me into the low stick dancing. And he said, there's like a sign that says, come hit on me.  Does it bother you at all?  If they start getting really pushy about it, I'm just like, I'm straight. But a lot of times it's really funny because I'll get in a conversation with them and they'll be like, you're straight, aren't you? I'm like, yeah. 

Recording: (101/ 10721) 
 And before he left for Alaska, I actually took the time to, I didn't want to, but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were IMing each other.  and he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and I told him, you know, I'm like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about, you know, talk  about not liking, I believe. And I told him, I said, I can understand if in our minds there's a problem, but we accept the fact that the 

Recording: (102/ 10721) 
 I blew a disc out. 

Recording: (103/ 10721) 
 Oh, not very right. And the first 20 years I worked at the Bureau, I worked in statistics. So I learned a lot about numbers.  and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they're misinterpreted. And my wife has been the director of institutional research at the university.  data research. They don't really have other kinds of research there. 

Recording: (104/ 10721) 
 like not go out. Pretty much your TV's your entertainment for the year. 

Recording: (105/ 10721) 
 that it's still really going on, you know, and his parents accepted him. 

Recording: (106/ 10721) 
 They weren't being represented. I don't know. I'll have to read. I didn't read the paper yet. 

Recording: (107/ 10721) 
 Oh, 

Recording: (108/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (109/ 10721) 
 And yeah, yeah, I shouldn't have done that. So now let's just go get some more furniture. 

Recording: (110/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure. It's usually the girls look younger than guys, I guess. I don't know. 

Recording: (111/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (112/ 10721) 
 go ahead and say well now sometimes she'll ask sometimes she does but let's assume she did she asked is it all right if I have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and so forth she puts them right  in there in that sink with those other dishes. Makes no efforts to clean them and I've seen this in many, many, many  incidents but I'm giving you this is very first hand. I know this and I strongly suspect that this is a typical, typical thing in our society today. 

Recording: (113/ 10721) 
 I was thinking of grandchildren. 

Recording: (114/ 10721) 
 I think he's in prison and he has no driver's license privileges for life.  It just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff. 

Recording: (115/ 10721) 
 Every time I found myself it goes up. It's a nice feature. Sorry, I'll stop. Go ahead. It doesn't matter. When I clear my throat and you're listening to it, it's going to be annoying as hell. Yeah, my apologies in advance. 

Recording: (116/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (117/ 10721) 
 which are children of light. 

Recording: (118/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (119/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (120/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (121/ 10721) 
 I try to be as much as possible too. I think it's very important that both parents, they see both. 

Recording: (122/ 10721) 
 Ha! 

Recording: (123/ 10721) 
 But you know that there and goes back to you know the quality of the quantity I mean obviously this poor kid You know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs and a basement  to figure out some way of reaching his nirvana or whatever, you know, and his parents didn't have a clue.  or if they did they didn't care. 

Recording: (124/ 10721) 
 again gets back to the 10% tithing and I think there's something else in the Bible where the lady gives only a small portion of the  portion compared to large portion but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that. We need to promote more of that. If we're going to  package things and materialize. We need to think more of that. But I think really take a whole night. What would you be doing if you were a third world country and didn't have a choice? 

Recording: (125/ 10721) 
 Oh well. 

Recording: (126/ 10721) 
 Not right now, I'm kind of job motivated. 

Recording: (127/ 10721) 
 Status symbol. 

Recording: (128/ 10721) 
 It's 

Recording: (129/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but 50 years ago if you had epilepsy, they'd lock you in a closet and throw away the key and wouldn't let you out. Most of the parents I've seen, to me, I'd rather see the kids with a step-parent. 

Recording: (130/ 10721) 
 Eh, it wasn't anything too huge. I think it had about 1,200 people in it or so. 

Recording: (131/ 10721) 
 You do too. 

Recording: (132/ 10721) 
 It's more of, it tends to be more of entertainment. I don't remember that being that way 30 years ago, but it does now. 

Recording: (133/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (134/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (135/ 10721) 
 I think it's like there's like a real like either  it's old people who are there retiring or whatever, or it's more of like a younger people there. I don't know, you don't see a lot. I don't know, there is middle-aged people there, but it's not so apparent.  It is here, I guess. 

Recording: (136/ 10721) 
 And I think there was an article this last Wednesday in the dispatch and business section as to how the PUCO can't regulate it and because of that they want to deregulate telecommunications.  And so for the past months we haven't been getting telephone bills for usage. We have the backbone we're paying for. And what's going to happen out of this whole thing is...  It offers us a lot of latitude where we can now, if we have a contractor let's say over 

Recording: (137/ 10721) 
 My personal belief is that they should be allowed to, because I believe they should have the male gender as well as the female gender for a proper bringing of them. 

Recording: (138/ 10721) 
 Doesn't bother me at all. 

Recording: (139/ 10721) 
 Um, 

Recording: (140/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (141/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (142/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (143/ 10721) 
 I mean, that probably couldn't be proven. I don't know. If anybody would do any decent studies on it, I'd just bet you a million dollars.  know, it would be the influence of TV. You know, and then another thing that's, well, TV is where it comes from, but like the  Kids are all into Pokemon right now. 

Recording: (144/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (145/ 10721) 
 almost  poverty and the classes in our society. That's just life. We're always going to be that. But the thing is, try to have understanding and compassion for them, and try to reach out. And sometimes people don't want it.  either and Sometimes you see well now I know why you don't want it because they don't know they don't know how to handle it They appreciate the thought 

Recording: (146/ 10721) 
 Pots never been associated with any kind of a crime that were some violent crime. 

Recording: (147/ 10721) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (148/ 10721) 
 And there was a lot of alcoholics in the military when I was in there. 

Recording: (149/ 10721) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (150/ 10721) 
 on Sunday. 

Recording: (151/ 10721) 
 It's still on, but I don't know. 

Recording: (152/ 10721) 
 I have experience in that and I'm thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing.  What's going on inside your head and your body isn't that peaceful? 

Recording: (153/ 10721) 
 My mom teaches there, so it's free tuition. I get a tuition waiver. 

Recording: (154/ 10721) 
 You know, because that will all go away about second grade. 

Recording: (155/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (156/ 10721) 
 Oh, you're kidding. 

Recording: (157/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (158/ 10721) 
 were on drugs or drunk or whatever. You know what I mean? 

Recording: (159/ 10721) 
 I have a friend in New Jersey, or two friends, a married couple. She's a lifelong Democrat. He's been a lifelong Republican. And there's always interesting discussions when  I go to visit and I went to visit them a few weeks before Clinton was formally impeached last year and I just decided I wasn't going to bring it up. 

Recording: (160/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (161/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (162/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I had the prerogative. I could have gone somewhere else and made more money. But the bad part was, as the university's trying to do away with  Civil service is a good thing and a bad thing. You know, you do, you had step raises and everything, so at least you did have an increase back then. Nowadays, you have none.  nothing. 

Recording: (163/ 10721) 
 Now. 

Recording: (164/ 10721) 
 If you have to come back to this weather I would do I'd is it really 

Recording: (165/ 10721) 
 um we went to the zoo we go to the playground take my dog to the playground we'll go shopping grocery  shopping 

Recording: (166/ 10721) 
 You know what, actually I don't believe they have anything booked so far. A lot of times I think this year people are more going out rather than having people come into their homes and things.  I've usually I've worked for different hotels where I've always worked on New Year's Eve and my husband this year is like, you know But we don't even have any plans. We were gonna maybe do something with some friends in New Year's  they're going to California. So I'm not sure even exactly what I'm going to do. But right now there's not an event scheduled. 

Recording: (167/ 10721) 
 which was a going thing. 

Recording: (168/ 10721)

I mean, there are a lot of people, I mean, I think just in the news a few weeks ago, they had a shooting that happened a couple years ago and they just came to a verdict on it.  and the parent left it in the top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was, he climbed up on a ladder, unlocked it, and he ended up shooting himself with it.

Do what you want when you're with your other friends, but don't do it in front of me.  I don't even like blonde jokes. I find those sexist and racist in a way. No one will tell them to me.

 And, as I say, we went to church fairly regularly, but to tell you the truth, I can't.  I don't remember too much that I was taught then, but I was exposed to it anyway, and I'm sure that some of it rubbed off on me.

I know within the media community there are people out there, hey, come on, we'll  go to dinner, we'll go to this and we'll do this and do this, just barely, barely breaking the barrier but not breaking the law.  So yes, very definitely, progressively has changed. 

Recording: (365/ 10721) 
 Those are the formative years of a child. 

Recording: (366/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and everybody has it, right? 

Recording: (367/ 10721) 
 My mom never had an upper girl. Jason's mom never had an upper girl. You know, and that looks worse to me. Did you see that? It takes 20 minutes. They thread this thing, this needle in your back. They put this, that sounds  worse to me than even having a baby. I don't really think about it back. So I guess it's true. You just have to wait and see when she gets there, what happens. 

Recording: (368/ 10721) 
 You can go anywhere, get something to drink.

 I'll be 48 when I retire from here and I'll be able to go out in the workplace and feel like I've gotten good education and work skills from working in the military.  here for this long and you know they've definitely paid for classes for me so I don't know what their big gripe is for education when they're striking and all this because I've never had a problem  If you want to take a class, we get classes. We can take anything we want.

So my oldest daughter is pretty detail-oriented so after we kind of helped her start you know and say you know you're gonna have to do this  these things. So you get this done. I said, and basically get it done like two weeks before it's done. So then you can say, oh, this isn't very good. And, you know, amend it or whatever, or, or

 It's still young, so you have to deal with it, but it is scary. You send your kids to school and you hear these things and it's just, no matter where it is in the country or the world, you hear of it, you know.  It really worries you. 

Recording: (380/ 10721) 
 So everybody's trying to be like everyone else.

I will share my faith with people that I'm really close to, like co-employees and other people.  other people that I'm in. If somebody gets real close to me in a class, eventually I'll share with them. But if I'm in a lecture hall, I'm not

 It was a nice birthday party. 

Recording: (402/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (403/ 10721) 
 Well, actually, anybody can try. There is a civil service exam you have to take and they place you on a list from that. Say you have an 80. Well, everybody that takes  takes it after you, gets an 81, is going to get hired before you do. So you can take it again, but if you score lower, you've got to keep that lower score. So sometimes people are apprehensive.  Once you pass that, the government says, we are ready to hire 1,000 people throughout the United States. 

Recording: (404/ 10721) 
 They said, well, since you're getting that, we'll cut your pay back to what you would normally draw.  on your apprenticeship program.

 What the hell am I doing here? 

Recording: (406/ 10721) 
 Um 

Recording: (407/ 10721)

Recording: (409/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I had about three or four friends that were actually gay. 

Recording: (410/ 10721) 
 That's where there's been a problem, but we're very open about that at home. My daughter is strong-willed. 

Recording: (411/ 10721) 
 on different topics. 

Recording: (412/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they called me like a few times, begging me to come. I know how hard that is for white males to get into. 

Recording: (413/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (414/ 10721) 
 Well, I read a lot about these particular British artists even before the show and before the mayor had a cow, so to speak.  So, you know, I mean, it's, some of the pieces are interesting. It's not exactly my style, but frankly, you know.  I just didn't see anything to get that worked up about. I mean, I saw the piece that he specifically objected to. 

Recording: (415/ 10721) 
 They used to grow wild when I was a kid.

 Then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department.

 Yeah, quite a bit. Yeah, I've seen Columbus grow from the time I've lived here as a child.  161, you know, Dublin Granville Road. You know, I can remember when that was all country.

 My parents homesteaded out there in 1911 or 12, shortly after they were married. 

Recording: (419/ 10721) 
 I was down in California for three months and I went to the produce stand and I took my umbrella.  rain too much in California. And I said, oh I'm from Oregon and I always think it's going to rain. And he says, well I'm from Washington and I know it's going to rain.  Right? 

Recording: (420/ 10721) 
 Oh, did you really? 

Recording: (421/ 10721) 
 for whatever reason. 

Recording: (422/ 10721) 
 Actually, Kauai. Yeah, so it was really nice. I thought, of course I didn't go to all of them, but it was nice.

 and make a partition through F disk, I get these really wacky errors. Everything gets transferred over to D drive, and I have no more C drive. It's gone. I don't know where it vanishes to.  So... It is. No, and I can't do a stinking thing on my computer. I have to use all the other guys' computers in my house. 

Recording: (424/ 10721) 
 All right. 

Recording: (425/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I do. I really do. I mean, these kids are getting guns. A lot of them is from their parents, but it's amazing how many guns. And they say that  The police are selling guns to people and they don't realize they're old guns that they confiscate and they don't realize where they're going. I mean, that amazes me.  It's always going to be the underworld and different ways that kids and people can get guns. And it's sad. I don't know how we could ever limit that, but there's 

Recording: (426/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Very much so. 

Recording: (427/ 10721) 
 So it's like you have these two different camps, the camp that gets enthusiastic and that's where I was, and then there's the other camp, and I'm sure they have their  own hierarchy, their whole structure, and like, you know, they do things their way. 

Recording: (428/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it was like freshman or sophomore year. 

Recording: (429/ 10721) 
 And yet, we sit down and negotiate for it. And then on top of it, those people that participate in the sponsors.  are just as bad 

Recording: (430/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (431/ 10721) 
 think they're screwed up anyway and they're just like well hey you know I can do that and I'll be on the yeah I do I think that's a big part of that  Because they want their name known and they don't care if they die anyway.  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (432/ 10721) 
 Pretty much, yeah. Easy come, easy go. Follow the leader, monkey in the middle, whatever. 

Recording: (433/ 10721) 
 I mean I think that's the best way to address it. And as far as the homosexual, I think there is kids who say, well maybe I'm gay, I don't know if I'm gay or what. Well, hopefully  they'll know their true identity eventually. I mean, yes, some people, I mean, I know men, several men who got married, had children, and then they decided they were gay.  Okay, were they gay before? But they did like women. 

Recording: (434/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that is one of the... 

Recording: (435/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but you put up with that anywhere. It's not just Ohio State. It'd be anywhere you go, you know. It's just like I said, you get, excuse me, you get assholes in. 

Recording: (436/ 10721) 
 that I don't understand is with the construction they start everywhere. You know you think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they'd work real fast and get that done and then  they'd move on. But it's like every single place in the city's got like four guys working. And you think, what the hell are you doing over there? 

Recording: (437/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (438/ 10721) 
 But it gets kind of old too, you know. Like all this week I haven't been able to get out, you know.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (441/ 10721) 
 Nah. 

Recording: (442/ 10721) 
 And you know I just really think they need to make that an option for a young girl. I really do because there's just you know there's just too many unwanted  children. There just is, and that really bothers me that we don't have another option like another country. We're a lot more right-wing here in America, but  I just feel that's got to be an option, you know, for these young girls. It just really does. 

Recording: (443/ 10721) 
 I just was going down like

 And you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood, but I think that that's still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in.  think 

Recording: (446/ 10721) 
 We're far less agriculturally related. We're more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation.  A woman can do most of the work that is being done outside of the home today versus what they could do.  have done as agricultural people. And so once again, though, that would bring people back 

Recording: (447/ 10721) 
 Walks away. 

Recording: (448/ 10721) 
 Sometimes I think it's been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life. On others, I think it's been very good because at least it lets us know what's going on in the rest of the world.  And if it weren't for that, some of the things we wouldn't know. And I think that as you increase your knowledge, you're far better off than just saying, this little hole over here, this is all I want to know about. 

Recording: (449/ 10721) 
 I checked my fax machine the next day and it says, my mother has decided to accept your offer. And I thought, oh shit, I don't want this. What am I going to do now? So I ended up talking to him and I just explained.  to him that he had caught me off guard and that I'd had more time to reconsider it. And it's true, because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said at that point  like the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me. He was a nice man. I felt bad. And so then I gave him some ideas about how he could sell it. 

Recording: (450/ 10721) 
 That was your youth. And that's good. 

Recording: (451/ 10721) 
 overpowerful as far as the number of guys being out there. They're violent. I mean, it's something that unfortunately does happen, but I mean, it's more how you're brought up, whether you can control it or not.

 Mmm. 

Recording: (453/ 10721) 
 your mind. You got to have your mind open to receive what your eyes and ears are. You learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school.  They help. They help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school. But there's a lot of things you're just not going to learn except by actual experience and living life.  And I believe that that's a lot of right there because I know I started to say well, you know I don't think I finished it. I myself have these once Getting only what I need versus

 My sister's last name is Goodnight, and when she had her first little girl, she said she was going to name her Dawn Ann. Goodnight, but she didn't. She didn't. 

Recording: (455/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well, what my opinion on our whole penal system is just, you know, well, it goes along with kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now.  We're definitely neglecting criminals. They need to have be educated and and worked with I mean they need to obviously they  someplace, some point, they've learned incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it, and

 Yeah, it's gotta be hard if you haven't had other projects. 

Recording: (460/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (461/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I think it could work, but I don't think people are ready to accept it. And if the people who are going to give them the information aren't ready to accept it.  them. 

Recording: (462/ 10721) 
 Right, but during the rest of the year, a lot of times we'll play really challenging and interesting band music.  And you don't always get the opportunity to do that in musical groups. Sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of what they expect the audience to do.  to want to hear. 

Recording: (463/ 10721) 
 Well, I... 

Recording: (464/ 10721) 
 some different types of courses and those types of things.

 She went to Columbus Alternative High School. 

Recording: (471/ 10721) 
 I don't think they should. I don't have any problem, you know, people are gay or you know, that's their business.  I don't think, that's not how this world was, they wasn't put, you know, it was a man and a woman to start out with.  I don't think they should encourage that. Maybe that's a hard topic for me to talk about because I don't

We talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes. We talked about issues and he said, you know, it was important to be heard. So I don't know if it was that it got past  on parent-wise or what it was.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (477/ 10721) 
 No, but he has a daughter and that was from high school. His girlfriend got pregnant and he stayed with her and they tried to work things out and they never got married  and that was when he lived in Canada. So she lives in Canada now and he talks to her all the time. And then they're real open about that. I mean she's real good about letting  the little girl come and she'll stay the summer with us and you know he'll drive up there and see her too. 

Recording: (478/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (479/ 10721) 
 But it's very difficult today to get to people. I've talked to some almost college-age students  and they don't see the relationship, you can talk logic to them all you want and it's not like the logic gets to them. And you can talk history all you want and it doesn't mean anything to them.  and I don't know why. I wish I did, but I don't know why. 

Recording: (480/ 10721) 
 OK. Yeah, sure. No, it's OK. 

Recording: (481/ 10721) 
 right. 

Recording: (482/ 10721) 
 I certainly wouldn't and would I expect my mom to stay in that kind of a situation? No way. I would want her to be happy and I would want my dad to be happy also.  for that situation I think it was much better. They got married kind of young too and I think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more  careful. I know that now it's a lot different than it used to be. People would get married and they'd just be expected to stay together and there's 

Recording: (483/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm Plus you get so many different students and well, I like just walking over here today, you know, just can't thought you know  I'm under how many of these people I walked by, you know, we're gonna be here in January Because you know, I because I did you know, I thought this is cool, man, you know

 You're allowed to have guests of the same sex. Like, say, like, I don't live in the dorms, but assuming I did, if I had a girl come from home to visit me, I'd have to either sneak her in.  and just hope we didn't get caught or have her stay out of friends.

 My brother lives in Connecticut and he's with the cement company. Concrete. I'm not even really sure. I've never even seen him, where he lives.  I've seen pictures and he comes and visits a lot but I've never gone up there. And his wife's an opera singer so she's real busy and they just are madly in love. He got divorced  after 17 years of marriage and found the wife that he has now. They've been married for probably almost, oh I don't know, 7 or 8 years. 

Recording: (490/ 10721) 
 You know, and you don't want to go to work feeling that you're worrying about your kids, and we've never really felt like that. And we kind of work a little different shifts, my wife and I.  So our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she doesn't start until 930 and I pick them up at four.

 Oh, they have religion. They have a religion class. They have religion every day, but some of it is just starting with prayer and Bible stories, and some of it's more the values. A lot of the teachers aren't Catholic.  Which I was surprised to hear that. In fact, the religion teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade, she had religion class every day, wasn't Catholic. 

Recording: (495/ 10721) 
 Depends on who the manager is at the time. Every manager's got a different agenda on what they want you to do.

 And he's a broker. He sells liquor licenses and things. So he's owned several kinds of bars. But originally he owned the Open the Top  Steakhouse which is real popular in Bexley and then sold it like three years later. So mainly clubs and businesses but two really good restaurants.

 It's like some of these places in Florida are kind of like ruined by tourists, like Fort Lauderdale, Daytona, after the kids get done.  You know forget it. It's like I cuz I used to when I was in Like a freshman I heard I heard like don't even go to Florida guys like they do not want students  You know, they want your money, but they don't like the trash and whatnot that they bring.

 I think it was a nice thing about what we had. We had grandparents that were not necessarily, they were out of state in some cases.  We didn't see them that much. We made it a part that we communicated with the grandparents regularly. And when we did, it was a special time.  Emphasize the fact that kids want to do certain things. They saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to

 I don't think it's really affected me. Obviously there's more places to go shopping or to eat or there's more traffic, which I don't particularly care much for.  But I don't think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community I mean I know in my own neighborhood it's it was  where you went to school with the people. At least once I went to high school, I went to public school. 

Recording: (533/ 10721) 
 Well I think sometimes it is because a child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown. I've always been the kind of person to believe. I never told  of my kids not to do something that I myself was doing. Example, smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner. They know you're not  old enough but I can. Now there are some things that the kids can't do at this age that somebody can't at another age possibly like go out on a date for example.

 but at the same time I don't dislike them or anything for it. I mean it's their choice. I mean the fact of the matter is it doesn't have any effect or anything  on my life, so. 

Recording: (538/ 10721) 
 Once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that, I don't think that has anything to do with it.

 So. 

Recording: (540/ 10721) 
 It would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving, first of all, how much are they earning?  how much they expect to pay for a house and all these other things. They say to you, well, I'll say 10% church, then you got  all

 I'm telling you, some people go nuts with the name. I worked at a children's hospital when I was in college, at the ear, nose and throat outpatient clinic a couple summers.  telling you I had to put some names on the books like you wouldn't believe. Ima Darling, that was her name, Ima Darling. And there was a little boy named Ephraim  Zimbalist, Junior, Coca-Cola, Franklin. I'm supposed to fit that in a space like that? 

Recording: (543/ 10721) 
 Well, I think a few of them have.

 Oh, sure. Yeah.

 And as more and more people are getting older and older, there'll be more need for it. There's gonna be a lot of things there's gonna be more need for as people get older.

Recording: (563/ 10721) 
 I think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and look all over the place for different plays. You look on the screen, it's different. You say, well, I would have done  this and this and this, but down on the field, they have to think that they're going to be doing this.

Recording: (566/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (567/ 10721) 
 And so that's a whole different, that's real different from the way it used to be, even though it looks the same. 

Recording: (568/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (569/ 10721) 
 Yeah, right. Yeah, we could put a little trailer there. We'd be outside most of the time anyway. 

Recording: (570/ 10721) 
 People that lived there, we've got the Indian department stores right down there on High Street and a couple of Asian groceries.  I don't know where they live. I mean, it seems like for those stores to be opening there, they must be somewhere in Clintonville, but I don't know. 

Recording: (571/ 10721) 
 I did my bitching, but it really wasn't nothing to do about it, because once they have their word in it, they're

 I was taking like 21 to 23 hours a quarter. 

Recording: (575/ 10721)

 Mm-hmm, I did. 

Recording: (577/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they're okay. They're parents. They're in their 70s now. I take what I need and leave the rest because they've got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine.  So. 

Recording: (578/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (579/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's really expensive, but that's why I went there for now. I wouldn't go there. It was actually my last choice for universities, but I went there because the price.

Recording: (581/ 10721) 
 I think for me personally, I would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where I wouldn't end up getting divorced.  it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as coordinating things. I know that sounds kind of patty.  I mean, I don't think it's bad, but I think that if you can find a way, obviously, to continue to make a relationship work, that you should. But my parents are very different. 

Recording: (582/ 10721)

 Wow, that's great.

 But people coming from other cities, like Chicago, New York, and places like that, where they were treated poorly by whites.  They tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you weren't like that, you know.

I didn't think it was that hard at all, but she wrote me some kind of nasty  you know at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight A average at the school before my class and I was giving her a B and she was her

Recording: (593/ 10721) 
 because they've done away with civil service step raises which were wrong because I could have done a crummy job and got the same raises doing a good job. Don't get me wrong. But now it is that  But you got people you don't even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they have no idea what you're even doing.

 As long as you, I already knew I was gonna be getting a notice, so, because I flunked out like in December, you know, and so in January I'd already  contacted the Navy and the Air Force about getting into, they were taking their tests and everything, taking their physicals. So,  you 

Recording: (599/ 10721) 
 Well, I grew up with just my mom. She had four kids and I was very quiet and did very well in school. 

Recording: (600/ 10721) 
 and neither one of these folks could answer yes or no.  It was healthcare for live-in partners. It's a simple question. Yes or no. How do you stand on this issue?  And it just drives me nuts that, you know, and I know that from a PR standpoint, you don't want to shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like that. 

Recording: (601/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (605/ 10721) 
 Yes, it's definitely having an effect on children and the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it, but they aren't doing it yet.  they will be able to pick up enough by changing the way they teach and so on in the next 20 years.

 Put my hand here, try to keep it out of the line of the wire.

 So if I spend time away from Cher, I become unpopular.

 like and the of is all those little words you're already supposed to know those you're supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it's just a little short sentence like my name is  Joanne.

 Well actually I've picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so I'm working for a research firm just for the convenience.  convenience of the hours. I want to go back into the nursing field, but right now I just can't take that much time away.  because it would be at least an eight-hour shift and I don't think that we're ready for that yet.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (619/ 10721) 
 That and I imagine that's about half and half right now, or maybe it's more on this side. I don't know So I think that that really is ever in evolution at this time tell you the truth  What's going to cause the world to end? I think what they really mean by that, I hope what they mean by that is that it will end the  way it's being run or the way it's being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content.  감사합니다. 

Recording: (620/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (621/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (622/ 10721) 
 Like a little coffee shop. 

Recording: (623/ 10721) 
 I'm just kind of appalled at what they put on the news anyway. It's not usually what I consider news. It's a lot of human interest stories and things like that, which... 

Recording: (624/ 10721) 
 But even so, we were on this and the Germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could, again, look right down at us.  We didn't go out in the daylight hardly at all. 

Recording: (625/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (626/ 10721) 
 so hard. Every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an F. My oldest daughter went to Northland first  because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there. And once she got into it, she went, oh, maybe not. So I said, well, whatever. So then she wanted to go to.  Because it's basically a Columbus public school that's geared to college only. I mean, if you're not going to college, don't go there because you will flunk out. It's very hard. 

Recording: (627/ 10721) 
 And I'm meeting with someone on Thursday, actually, who's in that field. And it's really just an open field. 

Recording: (628/ 10721) 
 That would just send me into the new millennium or whatever you want to call it. 

Recording: (629/ 10721) 
 You know, we're right there within moments if there's a flood or, you know, something like that, you call the contractor. I'll be in Thursday, you know, if you're air conditioned. So, they're always going to have to have people here, so I just feel  They're either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have 20 people that half of know what's going on and half don't.  But that's tough to do when you're starting people at $8 an hour and stuff. So there's Wendy's, McDonald's, there's places that you can make that money. 

Recording: (630/ 10721) 
 Well, the first thing is Clintonville. 

Recording: (631/ 10721) 
 Oh really? No? They don't have like your basic  amenities.  Really? Uh-huh.  It's got a wonderful atmosphere. It's a really cool place. We'll go back there sometime. 

Recording: (632/ 10721) 
 I mean, I liked Earl Bruce and I waited on him a couple times at a restaurant I worked at. He was the nicest man and when they did that, I don't know if you know about that, when they fired him the day before.  for the Michigan game for having a 9-3 season three years in a row. They fired him the day before that game. 

Recording: (633/ 10721) 
 Yeah, no.

Recording: (636/ 10721) 
 gave me these leading questions. I said, ah, I know where you're coming from. I've been confronted with that when I was Ohio State and so forth. And so I just laid it on the line to  and 

Recording: (637/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (638/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (639/ 10721) 
 I've gone to one, but I had a back problem. That's how I dealt with it, and it worked. 

Recording: (640/ 10721) 
 Yeah, high school a lot of people are really narrow-minded and work on really trying to fit in. In college people are more open-minded.  open-minded and they're more willing to express their own ideas. 

Recording: (641/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that was pretty bad. I think they... I don't know what happened. 

Recording: (642/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (643/ 10721) 
 It's a lot easier to market yourself. 

Recording: (644/ 10721) 
 be back although now I miss London. 

Recording: (645/ 10721) 
 And then there's somebody's house on three acres of land or something. 

Recording: (646/ 10721) 
 What are you doing? 

Recording: (647/ 10721) 
 the one that's 18 now, I thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four. Because his dad's left handed, my sister's left handed, I have one left handed parent. Well, all of a sudden  in one day picked up a thing with the right hand and he's been with his right hand ever since. So you really can't tell because they're pretty much either or.  until they were about five. 

Recording: (648/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Which is good for me because I don't ever go there anyway. 

Recording: (649/ 10721) 
 I have a decoder card. What it does is it decodes the DVD right away rather than sending it through the processor.  It's a lot faster, it doesn't depend on my processor time, like the movie doesn't skip or anything. It just goes straight through.  So what do you do? Do you have meetings and then talk about computer stuff?  you 

Recording: (650/ 10721) 
 But it's another thing that they're in their own, in the house where the parents are every night and not going into the garage and finding things. 

Recording: (651/ 10721) 
 Then while she was out there, she met a cowboy who was also from Ohio.  They were married while they were out there, I guess.  As my son used to say, she was a piece of work. 

Recording: (652/ 10721) 
 Cause you gotta trust the people you're around, you don't really wanna piss them off. 

Recording: (653/ 10721) 
 So they're kind of spread out 25, 25, 10% is kind of how it's divided out between the projects. 

Recording: (654/ 10721) 
 Really. 

Recording: (655/ 10721) 
 going to jump up and start hollering about my faith. And I won't walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people.  I don't feel I'm ready to do that yet. I think there's a place and a time for doing certain things.  And this is one of the biggest things that people use as a reason for faith. 

Recording: (656/ 10721) 
 I don't think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries. It's just too long. People start tuning out.  and there's only so much you can say. And it's like the candidates... 

Recording: (657/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you may be right. Could be. Could be. 

Recording: (658/ 10721) 
 That's the optimism, yeah. OK, I have now Dover and Ferry. What else do I need to remember? 

Recording: (659/ 10721) 
 Not at all.

 She would pamper the kids and well, from where we lived, we lived just all, I don't know whether you're acquainted with  north end of Columbus. But anyway, Indianola Avenue is one of the main thoroughfares. And we lived about a block and a half off of Indianola.  And then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drugstore and a barber shop.

 Give us a jab, sure.

 you can do for them. And that all applies to the Polaris question as I see it. And I think also that it's a very, very  major financial gain for the developers who are doing it, and it's going to therefore harm the many, many areas that it affected.  such as North North North North North what's the name of the shop North what Northland like

 I got a really high IQ, extremely intelligent. All through high school I was just coasting on that intellect. I'd go in, take an exam, bing bang, go out, get an A. I wouldn't even study for it. I think I studied it as  much my senior year as I did my freshman year for one midterm or one final. And that just didn't work when I got to college. But I didn't know that until I was done with my freshman  with a 1.7 GPA. About, let's say the middle of winter quarter I

Recording: (677/ 10721) 
 I was interested in going out to California and I've been out there several times but it was supposed to be tight. Why wasn't I interested in moving out with my mother? 

Recording: (678/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (679/ 10721)

Recording: (680/ 10721) 
 Um,

 In general, I think the United States has a fairly well-developed class, not like  class structure in which you can't move up or down but like we have a fairly large middle class. 

Recording: (687/ 10721) 
 and the house smells wonderful. It's like birthday cakes. I think my wife's was the last one. I make her one and we trade off.  a Betty Crocker at Oddlots. It was 22 cents. The icing was 22 cents. I made it and everybody goes, this is really good. It's like a sour cream icing. And they go,  boy this is really good. They go, did you buy this? And I go, no I made it. And they go, really? And I go, yeah it cost me 44 cents.

 And so.

 That's really hard to say. If she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran, negatives don't work in Columbus. Columbus really does have a heart.  and that just doesn't play in Columbus. What plays in the state and the people who ran her campaign ran Voinovich's campaign and Betty Montgomery's campaign.  campaign and that negative stuff works statewide. It doesn't work so well in Columbus. I think even a younger woman

 we'll do this and we'll do this. So we checked out the Catholic school and they were organized that way. And it just was a better match for him. And then my daughter  went to school, it was just easier to take him to the same school. And that goes back to another thing I wanted to say about why the discipline and behavior may  be different in the Catholic school is you're paying big bucks. You know, it's $4,500 a year for us to send her to school.  you

 I  you have to go for things to be considered a problem of something coming up again. I mean as long as he's not didn't have any history of being like an addicted user or  anything like that. I mean, I can't say it really bothers me too much. 

Recording: (695/ 10721) 
 See, that's how my husband was. He didn't have a pet growing up. 

Recording: (696/ 10721) 
 I think it depends on the child and I think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it. We're very strict as far as what gets done.  games they have. It's so wild. When we were kids, cowboy and Indians, everybody had guns. If you had the best death act, you were the  best you know and nowadays oh don't let him have a gun you know don't let him play with the you know even a squirt gun you know and so you wonder

Recording: (698/ 10721) 
 Really? 

Recording: (699/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I get to argue about stuff there. Here, I'm just kind of sitting around. 

Recording: (700/ 10721) 
 Yeah and there's a certain amount of gun laws that I actually didn't get into until I saw that.  in Ohio it's with a long gun or a handgun you have to be 18 but other places like  Texas there's no minimum age on owning a rifle or a handgun and you're looking 

Recording: (701/ 10721) 
 You know?

 No, I don't. I just got too expensive. 

Recording: (705/ 10721) 
 It's wild, it just seems like the music hasn't gone anywhere because they keep going back to the 70's. The Rolling Stones go touring, or Pink Floyd. These are groups from back then.  Where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people? They're not there, you know, and the quality of the music just must not be there. My daughter's into the Britney Spears and the  Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, all of a sudden now we're starting to get into some of that, that's starting to get

 vote with the candidate who's going to put the best justices on the Supreme Court. And I got a lot of people to vote for Clinton that way, both in 92 and again in 96.  And I think that's going to happen again because the candidates, and I'm telling you my politics here very clearly and early, but the candidates have pretty well spoken on  that issue already. I know which one will protect the right for choice and I think 

Recording: (709/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (710/ 10721) 
 So this is my first time like a doggie. So. 

Recording: (711/ 10721) 
 Kind of. I mean it was something I was really into until, I don't know, maybe about fourth or fifth grade.  grade at which point things sort of switched to, you know, like, I don't know, like killer robots or something, like Transformers, that kind of thing. In high school, I,  I think I cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys. I'm like Star Wars is fun. I'm gonna watch Star Wars more often. I had them on tape.

 Well, the charge was cutting class. Yeah, and what it was, I was supposed to meet my mom outside. I told my teacher, I brought a note.  Got to excuse slip and all that. I went down to my locker before and the teacher, we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you.  not a teacher but an administrator excuse me and she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole 30 minute 

Recording: (714/ 10721) 
 like with your kids, you love your kids but you don't let them have bad manners at the table and you don't let them run around with the wrong kids and you want them to behave well. That's how I see America.  America now and America has become more centrist and when it deviates from that either way, that's when people become upset.  I remember when, who was the other president that I voted for that won? Carter. Black Lives 

Recording: (715/ 10721) 
 Well, it's kind of hard. See, he's got two other kids. And one kid he had while we was together that he does not see at all.

 Right.

 Yeah.

We checked  to see if there was any messages at home to see if we'd heard from him. And got a message that my mother-in-law had fallen and she was in an emergency room, the same hospital fortunately.  down there. Then on the way home, I got a phone call on the cell phone from the hospital that my father-in-law had had some

 So when they built the continent up on 161 it was almost all gay. German village was almost all gay at one time. Yeah, there's a big gay. You got what, about  20 gay bars probably here in Columbus alone. 

Recording: (721/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean, it is. I think it's tough and I think it's really an individual basis. But I would say that there's a lot of other things that are  that would contribute more to any societal problems than divorce. I really don't think that that would be the main.

 psychologist so took a long time to get to that point but so we've been talking to the psychologist about it he said most people that raise  in that background, he said, they go different ways. One's they just fall into the same pattern as their parents or they're a survivor. And she appears to be a survivor.  She's never really had what I would call a normal family relationship. She likes to spend time with us, which I'm glad.  you

 Yeah, it's 70 years old.

 I'm not really a big fan. I think one of the big problems is going to be initially just the  The monetary thing of it, you know, the people that supported the basically supported the minor league teams that they had here, you know,  like blue collar people with it. You can go for 20, 30 bucks and have a good time, get drunk, throw a beer, and up there, you know, you're not going to be able to do that.

 Why don't some of you come at 10 and another group come at 1015 and we're all trying to do the same thing at once and it doesn't work. You can only get so many people through that door.  If you say, I'm going to take five at a time, they can get in. But if you say, I'm taking 500 at a time, it doesn't work. The airlines always go,  and regulations and blah blah blah that's why we're delayed and it's really them themselves because they're

 I went there for Career Center in high school. And that was something that was exciting for me, but that's totally out of the question for me now. Because I have a kid, and there's no way I would do that.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (736/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, I heard something about that. 

Recording: (737/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (738/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I do. Because some boys might not wear them because they don't know how to put them on or I don't know. I'm not sure because I'm not a boy. Maybe some boys would experience with it before they  originally use it you know I'm not but I don't think it's it's encouraging them at all at the same time they should be telling them that  And they shouldn't have sex till they're married, you know. 

Recording: (739/ 10721) 
 Really? Yeah, I don't feel old at all. I mean, a lot of people think, wow, you should know what you want to do. And I guess there is different phases.  Maslow's hierarchy what is that the hierarchy of needs Maslow anyway

Recording: (742/ 10721) 
 Guns should definitely be kept in a lockbox where kids can't get them. Besides that, there's not a whole lot that  government can do. It's more the parents' responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids' hands.

 They had a 2 by 4 on the door for over a month.

 You were past ready. Yeah.

 The money is great. It's the biggest raise I've ever given anybody here at the university.  they  was the fact that these people didn't want to be separated from the hospital. They don't think it's fair, you know, that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or

 Well, yeah, I could have just took him out in the woods and whooped him, but what's that gonna prove?

 It doesn't have to cost anything, but you can go do it with your family or whatever.

 It's

 Well, that's what I'm saying. 

Recording: (777/ 10721) 
 And that's really an important issue right now. I saw that the first time in 1992 because I haven't said it yet, but anyone listening to this tape  you would be able to know I'm a Democrat and generally vote Democratic although I'll tell you I did vote for Greg Lashuka once and if he had run again I would have voted for him because I like his style and he hasn't been  bad for the city, but I'm generally a Democrat and I've only voted for two people who won the presidential election. And I knew in 92, early on,

 Wow, you taught psychology? 

Recording: (784/ 10721) 
 Yes, I just don't, I'm not comfortable with another man being around my son like that. So, I mean, if I dated, I mean, you know, I'm just.  I just, I don't know. I haven't felt, I've went out a couple times, but I won't let it get serious or, you know, no sane night, nothing like that goes on.  you 

Recording: (785/ 10721) 
 I don't need to work that many hours. 

Recording: (786/ 10721) 
 No, mom, we don't want to do that because they don't want to have to be responsible for them at school and wherever.

 Absolutely.

 And I do have a brother.

 That's sad.

 Ah.

But I try to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently is no reason to think they won't be  be successful in life. Mark Spitz won an Olympic gold medal. He has a learning disability. Cher Bono can't remember a phone number without transposing two

 She is four months, almost five.

 Well, I don't think that women should be on the front lines.  Some women are physically able to do what's needed. Some definitely aren't. Of course, by the same token, some men are.  But as support groups, I think that's all right. 

Recording: (801/ 10721) 
 I'm just saying the honors would be better just because of the smaller class size. I have like 400 in my class right now. 

Recording: (802/ 10721) 
 this means I get to hear more of my book. 

Recording: (803/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's a good idea. 

Recording: (804/ 10721) 
 But then again, I feel like sometimes I'm so naive. I mean, a lot of that wasn't introduced. And I was just like, well, should I have known that? 

Recording: (805/ 10721) 
 I was  which is fascinating. But, you know, I mean, our first day, I walked in, he said, hey, I'm Tom. You ever smoked pot before?  I was like, no. He said, we got a whole year together. And I'm directly quoting. That is the first thing he said to me. That is the first thing

 And I tell them writing is not an event, it's a process. It's like getting your braces put on. You go in one time and they might pull a couple teeth.  And you go in the next time, they might put that little wire on. And you go in the next time, they might put the lower ones on, or part of them. And the next time, then they put on more. And then one time...  They'll tighten them a little. But it's a process that happens over a period of three years. It's not an event. They think they can sit down and write, okay, I'm done.

 Hm?

 Yeah, because I have a problem with getting to know people. I'm shy at first.

Recording: (818/ 10721) 
 Before that I worked at Channel 4 TV station for about five years.

 Um... 

Recording: (820/ 10721) 
 I delivered the Columbus dispatch in the morning too, so. 

Recording: (821/ 10721) 
 so embarrassed. I'm so sorry. And the guy's like, eh, nobody else is eating it. She might as well. 

Recording: (822/ 10721) 
 Yes, it's the Democrat.

 Is that right?

 And so I got some of the inside dope out of the area from him.  I don't know whether it had been a large granary or something that had a concrete floor. And some industrious GI had chipped a hole in one.  about so big around in that.

 I love that. 

Recording: (827/ 10721) 
 Why really think that's happening right now? Because I think that I don't know what the divorce statistics have been recently, but I do see that more people who are getting married  married, are staying married, because those that would have gotten a divorce, they're not bothering to get married to begin with. They're just living together, and if they separate, so what? And I  I think that 

Recording: (828/ 10721) 
 can't focus or can't attend to anything. But what's really happening is they attend to everything. 

Recording: (829/ 10721) 
 I wish I would. These guys going to military school and so forth, you know they've had problems before somewhere along the line, whether it's academics or social.  Are you ready to take on this additional responsibility? No, but we don't promote it. Again, we have academics for the  University. Oh, you're going to be a sport athlete? Oh, then we got a different standard here. I'm sure they do.

 along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way, why you just don't question that. And I just don't do that. It's wrong.

 Right.

 like a hot meal, like they have a cafeteria there, because I was talking to one of the managers and he said, if we don't do that, then they won't be thinking about our quality.  they'll be thinking about getting food and they'll be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it. 

Recording: (839/ 10721) 
 yes for attention and yeah. 

Recording: (840/ 10721) 
 There's no doubt in my mind that he heard those voices. Now whether they were actual audible voices or whether they were voices from the inside,  line.

 Yeah, and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his own understanding of phonics. And yeah, I've been pretty impressed. I'm like, wow.  You got that really, really close to being the right spelling.

 That's right. That's right. It's a parakeet.

Recording: (845/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there was a lot of them and they were not very good. 

Recording: (846/ 10721) 
 or they don't really give a damn. That's the thing. I've got some friends with kids and I see it like on the bus or with, you know,  when you're working somewhere and the way people treat their kids. 

Recording: (847/ 10721) 
 I don't remember that at all. I know how to do it, but I'm not sure who taught me how to do it. 

Recording: (848/ 10721) 
 on the issues, but I think it does mean a lot to other people. So I can't really answer that question how they would have voted. Because I didn't think that Mike Coleman exactly had charisma either.

 No ands, ifs, or buts, you go to jail for three years.

 Not necessarily the Catholic beliefs. 

Recording: (851/ 10721) 
 and then like let's see a lot of it was I mean most of it was like pre-labor and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video it was  mostly like labor-related. 

Recording: (852/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (853/ 10721) 
 I didn't need to, so I didn't want to. 

Recording: (854/ 10721) 
 Now, well, it's like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping. The fun part, you go out and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that, and then you have somebody else do that part. But I don't do like major.  or gutting or anything. I just like to get something that needs, that I can have a vision. I can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom  kitchen and blah blah blah blah blah blah. So that's the kind of stuff and I've only done three or four of them but it's fun.

 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (858/ 10721) 
 I look like a college student that would go here, so I've never had a problem, so we go and do that. And like, we're planning a road trip. We haven't decided. We're thinking Atlantic City.  or Florida or New York City or New Orleans. Those are the choices and we're trying to narrow it down.

 That's really true.

Recording: (864/ 10721) 
 we should look at it as a sport. 

Recording: (865/ 10721) 
 The core is 

Recording: (866/ 10721) 
 No, you know I should. I really should. I do that with the dog without even realizing it, but I haven't just because I've ran for so many years or jogged.  Excuse me, I don't run. I'm too slow. Get the correct terminology there. Yeah. 

Recording: (867/ 10721) 
 why are you doing it now? But and then my youngest one, she likes to dress totally different. She's sort of like a little bit of a preppy, but she does not  understand why people want to have like eyes out on their shirt or you know a name on their pants and she says I just think that's stupid she says you can buy nice clothes without  that. So she's neither one of her pressured me and the one thing that was really odd when they were little is we would go like to Toys R Us and up and down the rows and 

Recording: (868/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they do. Let's see. You have to complete either a thesis or a contract, which consists of taking lots of honors classes. 

Recording: (869/ 10721) 
 And it really isn't though because I think it's actually, it's really freeing not to have to drink and all these things. So you just kind of, I feel like  I can get along with any people. And so it doesn't really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it, I guess.  And nobody's perfect. I mean, everybody has their prejudices, I guess, and fears. So getting over that.

 I just—I'm old-fashioned, but I—  And I can hardly conceive anyone being a genuine homosexual.  Evidently they are, but it's so against human nature, I think.

 I enjoy traveling, I enjoy meeting people. When I go on these travel things I have to do it for business, I meet with the ships and so forth, go back behind, but then when I go  But the ports, the companies pretty much know what they contract with, so I like to meet with the people there, the Gestapo, so I'll talk with them.

 But I'm mainly an artist. I work in pen and ink and colored pencil and do mainly humorous sort of things, cartoony things. 

Recording: (875/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you get to see all the different kinds. I think even if I don't want to go into it, rotations in every single area will be interesting. I shadowed in the  psych ward last week and that was really interesting and I have a feeling I'm gonna love my rotation but I don't want to be a psychiatrist. 

Recording: (876/ 10721) 
 looks like a spider web

 Yeah, mine don't have the time. 

Recording: (881/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (882/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (883/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's true. We went OSU's, they've got a nice facility. I mean they have a labor and delivery room. It's weird though because when you go they show you  They talk about all this Whirlpool bath thing around with it. I don't know if you've heard those commercials or not But there's only one room that's like that 

Recording: (884/ 10721) 
 No, my husband yeah, he's he's from she can wear a bandana, but that's it and You know I would love to do that with her only on  things like that I wouldn't be the type that would put a sweater on her on Tuesday and a little skirt on her on Wednesday but I would get a kick out of that she  you

 You'd run around in three pairs of sweatsuits and a vinyl jumpsuit over that, under heaters.

 And then there's Columbus. 

Recording: (887/ 10721) 
 I can't even go out and sign that long. I've had melanoma, cancer and stuff. So I sold my boat. Now mainly my hobby is just tinkering around stuff.  buy a car, fix it up and sell it. 

Recording: (888/ 10721) 
 That's why I'm here. 

Recording: (889/ 10721) 
 Yeah, just to watch people go, what do you just do that for? And I'm like, and what grade are you in?

 He does. And his love, his music is extremely good. He taught himself, by 16 he's playing eight instruments very well.  He just and he can't do that now where he lives now he lives with This is another thing that boggles my mind his girlfriend's mother she's  He's afraid his girlfriend, her daughter was going to run away, so she lets them sleep together in their house. When she, her daughter was 14.

 And so, shortly after he was healed enough to go back to work, they were married. 

Recording: (893/ 10721) 
 Well, definitely it just happened to me when I was in the third grade. Two of our friends went home after school and we were playing  with a gun and everything and one of them shot and killed the other one, you know, accidentally. It just goes to, you know,  My dad always had the gun, he didn't have it locked up all the time, but it wasn't necessarily in the same place all the time either. So if you weren't really looking for it...  you

Recording: (899/ 10721) 
 But when it came down to it, what was the protest really about?  I'm not being clear because I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with this. I'm very cynical about the world I've inherited because I see a world in which my political views  have been silenced by 50 years of international politics and propaganda. 

Recording: (900/ 10721) 
 So, yeah.

 Sometimes she and Mary had more disagreements than I ever had with her.

 Professors, yeah, well, as I mentioned a while ago, I happen to have, I'm one of 15 siblings. 

Recording: (903/ 10721) 
 Right. Well, when I was taking teacher education classes here and observing classroom teachers,  They would always tell me, you need to give a grade for class participation. 

Recording: (904/ 10721)

 Heh heh. 

Recording: (914/ 10721) 
 I can't find the one I want. I mean the job market is huge down here in Columbus. I mean I want a job  right around $9-$10 an hour so I can get a full 40 hour week and I won't have a problem with me leaving at 5 o'clock because I have a class at 5.30.  But that's what I'm doing this summer. I'm still searching for a job. I would have done some more searching today, but I've had a few problems with my satanic computer. 

Recording: (915/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (916/ 10721) 
 Right. I have a neighbor that's that way. 

Recording: (917/ 10721) 
 Basically, they didn't legally adopt him or anything, but they're the ones that he considers his family, really. And I mean, he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad.  but it's always kind of a challenge for us. 

Recording: (918/ 10721) 
 I went to Brookhaven, which is up on Carl Road near North Le Mans. 

Recording: (919/ 10721) 
 It doesn't have any words in it like exacerbate or undoubtedly, I'll tell you that. 

Recording: (920/ 10721) 
 And that was pretty done. 

Recording: (921/ 10721) 
 We couldn't have class and in addition they were like trying to tip over buses and throwing stones at them. 

Recording: (922/ 10721) 
 and just took it and ripped it. 

Recording: (923/ 10721) 
 Well I work with around mostly black people and it's a weird situation. I heard more prejudice than I'm  noticed now than when I only worked around a cup level. 

Recording: (924/ 10721) 
 Then they killed themselves so we'll never know from their end point why they did it but I Think there's got to be something  That we could find out from you know from their parents as to how they live, you know, they could have been Anything, you know  They could have been down there. They could have been making him making him do it, you know

He said, I would, but that'd probably have to be my job to do if we was living like that. I was like, God, man.  Rodney King all over again. 

Recording: (931/ 10721) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (932/ 10721) 
 And then we'd know where to shift from there to another target. 

Recording: (933/ 10721) 
 Oh, maybe. I, you know, because I was, you know, I was fooling around too when I got ninth grade and  I don't know. I didn't wear any condoms or do anything like that. And I just am very lucky for never getting pregnant.

Recording: (938/ 10721) 
 I feel like I have friends and when we say, oh, we're going out to the bar, like we all know which bar because there's only one that college students go to. 

Recording: (939/ 10721) 
 That squirrel is looking kind of good right now 

Recording: (940/ 10721) 
 Well, you can carry a weapon here in Columbus. I can carry a weapon right now as long as it's out in the open.

 Whatever you need. 

Recording: (942/ 10721) 
 We went back to our room and we watched a movie. My roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer.

 I was raised in the Sunday School of this church up here. Yeah, so I'm a longtime member. And in fact, I think I may be about the longest  term member of the choir right now. Yeah. Because I sang in the choir there when I was in high school back in 1970. So it's 30 years  years ago. Yeah. Right.

 Yeah, a lot more.

And I used to say to some of my black  friends, don't you see what you're doing? Don't you see the greater implications of this? Oh, no, we need to have him move faster. I said, you know, that'd be great in an ideal world. This isn't an ideal  world. You have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not. What you're going to do is you're going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you're going to give people a

 I don't know. Maybe if teachers, just their status in society isn't real high when it should be, it's more...  like garbage men get paid more than teachers, you know, and how, but it, so it's just like people always talk about, you know, education for the, you know, we got to like,  think about our child's future or whatever, but really teachers are paid crap and don't really get a lot of respect from anybody. Like professors and stuff get

Recording: (958/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (959/ 10721) 
 That's it. That's what I worry about the larger school systems too. That's what concerns me with Hilliard. You get such a large variety of people compared to a lot  like where I was in the smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that. Your parents knew their parents. Yeah, your parents knew their parents, their parents knew their parents.  Now, you know, and I walk to my friend's house and half her friends, if she's going over to play, they got to drive them almost because they're all around.

 really enjoy. One of the things I don't like about living in the big city is, is like, but I've gotten used to, but I don't like the fact that every time you look up in the night  sky. All you see is this like orange haze. You can't see stars very well. The noise, I mean there's always noise. I remember last year living in the dorms,  Every morning at 2.30 in the morning, there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived. I lived in Taylor, so it's

 I don't agree with that at all. I think if your parents are unhappy together, the only thing that's going to happen is it's going to trickle down and you're going to have to listen to them being miserable. And I think it's much more  positive to have two families that are happy than one family that's miserable and they fight and you feel like it's your fault because this happened.  it was easier that they split up when I was younger, then I can't imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up. I think that that would be probably very difficult. 

Recording: (963/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (964/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (965/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (966/ 10721) 
 well, like a million miles down to the South End or something like that. But you just punch in your numbers always. You just talk with numbers.  It's interesting to add on. 

Recording: (967/ 10721) 
 which I think is kind of nice. So, I mean, it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable. I mean, my biggest thing is I just want to have a room all to myself. You know, I don't want to go someplace where I'm going to have to  like deal with something else. So I mean it looks it looks nice but I would be more comfortable at home I think once I go home. 

Recording: (968/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (969/ 10721) 
 And they should. And very rarely do doctors even ask about allergies. And more and more people don't even realize.  get sick so often, they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people, when they can't figure out what's wrong with them.  Because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they've eaten 

Recording: (970/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (971/ 10721) 
 It was during school, you'd go there, you went there for two years, your junior and senior year.  go in the morning and your senior you go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you're at the Career Center then you go 

Recording: (972/ 10721) 
 So 

Recording: (973/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (974/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (975/ 10721) 
 Oh ja. 

Recording: (976/ 10721) 
 The Reds more so than Indians back my younger days because they weren't worth a damn but 

Recording: (977/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (978/ 10721) 
 We have definitely made some progress in that direction. I still think that there's considerable progression that needs to be made.  I was just talking to someone a couple weeks ago who's a fellow history major and her, actually her brother's a fellow history major too and a friend of mine. I don't know him all that well.  Apparently her family, I mean she's double major in history and chemistry, she plans to go to med school. Her parents, her family supports her in this, but they've made it 

Recording: (979/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (980/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (981/ 10721) 
 No, they should talk about, I think they should talk about that too. I never did it and I wish I could have waited until I was married.  You know, you're going through that, whatever you go through when you're a teenager. So you're like, so what? Well, most kids. I'm not, you know, some people, some kids still do that.  Think yes, I do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (982/ 10721) 
 Oh, I was going to say it would be interesting. 

Recording: (983/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (984/ 10721) 
 has to be a longstanding kind of thing. Yeah, you know, and that worries me more than I understand a lot of the objection is because this is just.  This is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know, you know, one legal step leads to another legal step and then we'll have gay marriage and all those things. But I don't think that would be a bad thing either.  you 

Recording: (985/ 10721) 
 Crime is a lot worse now, you know, on the streets than it used to be. 

Recording: (986/ 10721) 
 Yeah, because I don't have a degree. 

Recording: (987/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (988/ 10721) 
 I mean, we'd be 70 years old when the kid graduates from high school. And that wouldn't be fair to the kid. And we were doing it for the wrong reasons, too.  We talked about it, decided it wasn't a good idea. 

Recording: (989/ 10721) 
 et à y croire. 

Recording: (990/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (991/ 10721) 
 No. 

Recording: (992/ 10721) 
 But you need to get it out of your chest. 

Recording: (993/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (994/ 10721) 
 and this one could die, so. 

Recording: (995/ 10721) 
 I have to admit, when we go to try to play golf sometimes and not have a tee time, you can't even get in. 

Recording: (996/ 10721) 
 They just can't single out what I should attend to and what I should screen out. So they attend to everything equally. The train going by out here, the teacher talking up  here, the kid over here shuffling his papers, this kid back here picking up his pencil, and so they get a little bit of everything and they don't learn anything. 

Recording: (997/ 10721) 
 the world. I've heard stories, you know, yeah, people will pay, but why? But it's like, yeah, if you say it's true, I'll look into it.  Is that okay?  I think that's a really good point.  you're going to learn it even more perfectly, so it's going to be less and less English-like. 

Recording: (998/ 10721) 
 WITH THAT BOY. 

Recording: (999/ 10721) 
 That goes with the disorder. They know who's button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and where the line is.  and they push you always. That's why teachers, they drive the teacher up the wall. 

Recording: (1000/ 10721) 
 I think it's probably too though that a lot of people aren't used to it. I mean they're not from Ohio. I've found that in Columbus a lot so they're kind of more tentative or they're  from the south or something like that. So, there. And then you run into a lot of people that are from Ohio, but I've noticed that a lot of people, rarely do you meet people born  and raised in Columbus. 

Recording: (1001/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I did. 

Recording: (1002/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it was interesting. 

Recording: (1003/ 10721) 
 Yeah, one more thing to deal with. On the other hand, it beats, you know, growing up in 50 foster homes or an orphanage. 

Recording: (1004/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that blocks out all that extraneous stuff that's trying to pull you away. 

Recording: (1005/ 10721) 
 It got kind of rough to have her here for a couple, three weeks out of the, or a month or something like that, you know, during the summer. 

Recording: (1006/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1007/ 10721) 
 It's all over. They contract with Dominion Homes and Dominion is, seems like it's going up everywhere, and M.I. So they're all over. They have projects all over. 

Recording: (1008/ 10721) 
 I don't know. 

Recording: (1009/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1010/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1011/ 10721) 
 I don't have a good opinion of Columbus schools at all. No, not at all. 

Recording: (1012/ 10721) 
 But I am pretty involved.  What do you get out of the church?  necessarily designed as, I heard this in a sermon, this is really good, it's not designed as the congregation comes in and says wait 

Recording: (1013/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they're pro-strike. We're getting money on Buck IDs, but, you know. 

Recording: (1014/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (1015/ 10721) 
 She believes no man will love you so much not to cheat. And I don't believe that. So I'm not with her son. 

Recording: (1016/ 10721) 
 Right. And it's all the bucks. Because people I work with, you know, there are some people I work with that have house payments. One guy, he has the biggest, $2,200 a month.  And a lot of them have like 1500 and up and you know, I bought my house years and years ago It's like 485 and I wouldn't dare tell him that  But it's like, you know, because they're always, you know, there are people there that make a lot more money than I do and they're always like broke. But yet, you know, like when they go do something, they've 

Recording: (1017/ 10721) 
 wander around, look at things. 

Recording: (1018/ 10721) 
 I grew up in Columbus. 

Recording: (1019/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but, you know. 

Recording: (1020/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I hope to, uh, at 49, you know, I've learned a heck of a lot. A lot of things I wouldn't want to know, you know, but...  But I think they've been really good as long as you turn them around and make them a positive statement for you. But that's why they like to have the...  a bookstore just down around campus, you know, and people can come in and go over there and relax, you know. 

Recording: (1021/ 10721) 
 You know. 

Recording: (1022/ 10721) 
 figure out how to do it myself. So I got on some of my news groups and I'm like guys can you help me? Oh no it's not that I hate Microsoft it's I mean  They have to do what they have to do. I mean, people don't understand that software has to stay up to date on the minute or they get sucked under.  I mean there are operating systems that people haven't even heard of that were the thing in their days. I mean a lot of people know what a 

Recording: (1023/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, it's fun. 

Recording: (1024/ 10721) 
 I had them when I was 21. I just pretty much became a homebody. I'm a homebody now. I don't go out.  take my kid places and drop him off he's with me all the time I don't run around the place we're at home when I come home from work he's at home with me we don't we he goes  a bed at 8 and I go to bed by 10 and it's just you know it's just like yeah 

Recording: (1025/ 10721) 
 What are they like? 

Recording: (1026/ 10721) 
 And eventually he was all right with it. He got used to it. 

Recording: (1027/ 10721) 
 You know, just turn right out in front of you. Everybody's running red lights nowadays. I mean, which laws you gonna pick out to enforce and which laws ain't you?

Recording: (1031/ 10721) 
 They have this thing about, the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breastfed have higher IQs. 

Recording: (1032/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1033/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1034/ 10721) 
 I don't know where he got the contact, but anyway, he went up to Boone, Iowa and joined the National Guard out, which was field artillery.  and with the expectation of their being mobilized soon, which they were. And so he was home one weekend and talked to me about it.  and I went on field artillery. I was exposed to that when I was in ROTC at Ames, so I thought, let's be better than carrying 

Recording: (1035/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well you're very smart, you know. 

Recording: (1036/ 10721) 
 Well, there's been quite a change in the attitude of the general public, I think, as far as women working away from home is concerned.  And I don't know, I'm glad that my wife was able to work there at home.  Well, actually, she worked in an office when our first boilie was this small. 

Recording: (1037/ 10721) 
 No, no, she has to do it. It's chaos up there. It is chaos. I mean, they had somebody come in to oversee the whole setup to  see where they needed more help at, whether they needed more nurses, and the guy told her the person that was in charge, the head nurse or whatever, there's no way that person can do  that job. They still do it. So when you're in charge, it's just a nightmare. You're supposed to know where every single patient is, where they're charged, what's going on, what room they're 

Recording: (1038/ 10721) 
 Just my wife and I this time. 

Recording: (1039/ 10721)

Recording: (1043/ 10721) 
 they're confused. I don't know that saying home is for everyone and I don't think parenting is for everyone and it really makes me sad.  sad when I see somebody, you know, we just want our

 Right. 

Recording: (1045/ 10721) 
 carry around this baby. We went to a hockey game with him and here he is with this baby at this hockey game and it was just like at 11. 

Recording: (1046/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1047/ 10721) 
 from the sofas and the chairs and take a knife and cut doors in it. And they would play with that for weeks, you know, until somebody, one of their friends would come over and have a little accident.  And then we go, well, we have to build a new house. But they just, reading and playing with stuff like that, they enjoy. 

Recording: (1048/ 10721) 
 Yeah. And it's like number one in the union. And that's like such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone's life and be like, oh, our bad. That person was innocent. You know. 

Recording: (1049/ 10721) 
 I mean as old as I am I still got that against him and that's what I want my son to keep. I want him to know his father and be around him.  even though he's not the best of person, but you know.

 Gates was recognized he was nothing

 And the state of Ohio's definition of gifted child is anyone who scores 70% or higher on some test that they give.  Well, you know, they've seen half the students in Columbus schools were gifted students. It's impossible. Gifted students, there's 14 different characteristics to look at.  look at one thing. 

Recording: (1052/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and it makes it fun so you can actually see what your studying these teams does. You can go a whole season.  and nobody's pretty much coming close to your standard. When you win all that money, it's just like  yeah when you lose all that money it's like that's it I'm going home but I've known people 

Recording: (1053/ 10721) 
 for the slick image, it bothers me. He has a potential of trampling Gore. I think that Gore will be the nominee, no matter what Bradley does.  Gore has it sewn up because he's the insider. 

Recording: (1054/ 10721) 
 just just kind of instincts I guess.  Yeah, actually there are quite a, there's a well, pretty well-known doctor that has a ton of books and I go to La Leche League and  That's kind of their philosophy in a way. Yeah. Just that breastfeeding is, you know, a way to mother and

 winter of 91. And I went to Columbus State and I had just, there was a few years that I didn't go here and then so I came back.  So, altogether, I don't know how many years it's been, but... 

Recording: (1057/ 10721) 
 Well, that basically is, you know, as your influx of people move out of city limits and everything, you know, then you've got to have places for them to show up.  and everything and basically the Northland Mall's been there forever. Jacob, who owned Indians, owned it. He never did anything to it, you know, so.  You got your Lazarus, your Penneys, and mainstay places that generally moved there because of the 

Recording: (1058/ 10721) 
 Right. Right. That's right. Yeah. So that was an interesting and when we went to church up Hamilton and over to  and  out by Carl there's shopping center after shopping center after shopping center after housing development after but when we did that 

Recording: (1059/ 10721) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (1060/ 10721) 
 It's extremely difficult to deal with. 

Recording: (1061/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1062/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1063/ 10721) 
 Oh no. 

Recording: (1064/ 10721) 
 It's just the way it is, I guess, but it's like, you know, she says, if the mother's in the house, the mother's on duty. 

Recording: (1065/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1066/ 10721) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (1067/ 10721) 
 And then I would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure that they kept me there. But I think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable. I mean, I don't know. I've never done this before.  so I can't really say, but I mean, my feeling is the least amount of time I have to be in the hospital, the happier I'm gonna be.

 I wasn't gay. But you know what I mean? I could care less about gay people. Like I said, that was the way I was raised. 

Recording: (1123/ 10721) 
 So what was different about it?  the things that I really enjoyed that was different was the traffic. That really became interesting and different for me when I started working for a courier  service winter quarter. I took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because I needed some money and I love driving. And let me tell you, it's really, really different

Recording: (1151/ 10721) 
 I would say for the most part that that is not really true.

 And then you spend some of that time going to seminars and upgrading your certificate

Recording: (1154/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1155/ 10721) 
 I'm sorry. I mean if I did if it was my own job, I would have struggled with it But it was not my own job and I didn't know what was going to happen so if they would have  have gotten some help in there for me I would have stayed perhaps but no I you know you can work for underpay and understaff and never you can't do everything.

Recording: (1161/ 10721) 
 I don't know I wouldn't personally like think that the parents should be held responsible. I mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility  for the fact that they should have been more aware and especially because I mean I believe that those, at least one of the two, had been in counseling and was doing  aggression management or something like that. You know, you would think that if they were going through something like that, you would just sort of, you know, maybe 

Recording: (1162/ 10721) 
 I think it should be the parents responsibility. But I have no objection to them teaching it somewhat in the schools I guess. 

Recording: (1163/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm.

So it's like if you hate math and you don't take it at  But then you decide you want to do something in math and you're like screwed like can't go back 

Recording: (1169/ 10721) 
 You know, when I hear about kids 12, 13, luckily I wasn't that early, but I think once they start, you know, like sixth grade, they really should relate to them.

 Wow, that's intimidating. 

Recording: (1184/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (1185/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he was up there too. The old guy with the beard and the tweed jacket. It was pretty cool. And they said most of  students are not even from Delaware. 

Recording: (1186/ 10721) 
 I was. 

Recording: (1187/ 10721) 
 It's pretty far. 

Recording: (1188/ 10721) 
 He's probably been married for four or five years. 

Recording: (1189/ 10721) 
 My husband is black. 

Recording: (1190/ 10721) 
 Am I gonna vote for? 

Recording: (1191/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1192/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah. I'm not married. I'm single. 

Recording: (1193/ 10721) 
 He said he's gonna kick my you know what and everything. I said, well, I'll be outside, you know. 

Recording: (1194/ 10721) 
 No, no, I think I'm alright. 

Recording: (1195/ 10721) 
 And pretty much stuff like that. And he'd try to quote the Bible and I'd have a Bible there with me and I'd look it up and it wouldn't be right at all. 

Recording: (1196/ 10721) 
 Not really, no. 

Recording: (1197/ 10721) 
 I come from the East Coast. 

Recording: (1198/ 10721) 
 That's what he does. He's not really interested in farming, although his major pastime is going out on his tractor and mowing lawn and doing other miscellaneous things. He really likes his tractors.  He really likes his tractors. He was raised in suburbia, so the tractor thing is a whole new thing for him.  really he really likes it. He's from Rochester, New York. Yeah. 

Recording: (1199/ 10721) 
 I don't know, she's getting a second child now. It's getting a little harder.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (1201/ 10721) 
 image you present that you've got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place you're going to be out of the loop and you know if people were just a little more comfortable with themselves you know and I  I'm a big one to talk. I was like Mr. Insecure for 30 years at least. Then I finally got to the point and I went to hell with it. It's too much work. Either like me or don't. If you don't, go to somebody else.  A lot of people are really worried. I don't know about boys, but I know girls are really worried about what people think of them and how they look. 

Recording: (1202/ 10721) 
 and their needs were immediate. 

Recording: (1203/ 10721) 
 that's what we are and i can handle that i'm not ready for that and that's crazy she's twenty three first person ever dated is older than me and uh... that's just frightening and she's like  dead serious. She was 100% sure I was the person she was going to marry. And I'll see her at church every so often, and she'll come up and give me a big hug. She's like, I miss you. And I'm like, well, I miss you too.  not probably the way you miss me but I miss I miss you yeah she's in lunatic no no 

Recording: (1204/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1205/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1206/ 10721) 
 I don't know, I like the story. 

Recording: (1207/ 10721) 
 everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake, but the way he's handling it saying I'm not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over. If he didn't do it, he might as well just be like no I didn't do it. 

Recording: (1208/ 10721) 
 what was going on, you know what I mean? It's just a tragedy. I had a friend when I was a kid too that we were like, I don't know,  or something like that. Well, it was an accidental shooting, and him and another friend of mine from the same class, you know.  He pulled a gun shot him, you know, I didn't know the damn thing was a little bit but And they were talking about another thing about that, you know, we're some kiddo 

Recording: (1209/ 10721) 
 They think everything they say is hilarious. Oh, it's just middle school. I think it's transitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time.  And when you have all the other things going on, like you can't read and you can't write and you can't spell, then it's just even worse. It's exacerbated.  even more. So I get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class. 

Recording: (1210/ 10721) 
 I think outside of the honors program a lot of it is, but within the honors program I think there's some really, really exceptional things going on. 

Recording: (1211/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1212/ 10721) 
 There's no faulting any of these folks, but still there's nothing else to do and there's nothing creative in response to say to this experience. So you end up with you're kidding again and again and again. And you had two individuals who said you're kidding and then immediately  immediately following it, nevermind, pretend I never said that. 

Recording: (1213/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1214/ 10721) 
 in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they wouldn't be liable. 

Recording: (1215/ 10721) 
 I know. 

Recording: (1216/ 10721) 
 I'd get more people asking me for that. And I mean, it turns out pretty nice. I'm making about 10 or 11 bucks an hour. 

Recording: (1217/ 10721) 
 gun control I'm not really too interested in. I mean you look at Israel people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they're one  of the safest nations in the country. Then you look at England, they have no guns at all and they're relatively safe. So I mean, 

Recording: (1218/ 10721) 
 That's Bishop Reedy. It's a Catholic school over on the west side. 

Recording: (1219/ 10721) 
 Yeah, which cracks me up because if you've ever looked at the parents of models, they're not necessarily all that attractive. Yeah. 

Recording: (1220/ 10721) 
 Well, I thought it went the way it was supposed to go. 

Recording: (1221/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1222/ 10721) 
 That's her job is to spoil them. So the poor things have the belly hanging on the ground. 

Recording: (1223/ 10721) 
 you know, talk to her, but people don't, when I was 14, I didn't care what anybody told me. I was going to do it no matter what. 

Recording: (1224/ 10721) 
 I think so. 

Recording: (1225/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, and you know what, I cook meat for my husband. I really don't cook red meat because he's on the road with his job and I know he stops at fast food places. But I cook him chicken and pork.  and I make soups, a lot of good soups for him with meat. And it really doesn't bother me to cook it. I'm not going to sit home and make it roast every night. 

Recording: (1226/ 10721) 
 Uh... 

Recording: (1227/ 10721) 
 even harder. 

Recording: (1228/ 10721) 
 It's just the spiritual aspect, there is a realm, even Einstein, the most brilliant man, supposedly, mathematically of our time,  even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has. Yeah, but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory. 

Recording: (1229/ 10721) 
 The problem is, like say, every airline wants to go to New York City and they want all their businessmen there at 8 a.m. Well, an airport has  So many runways and so many taxiways, and like say, ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports.  they end up shooting like 30 there. So instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there and hold while they're shooting them in, what they do is they'll 

Recording: (1230/ 10721) 
 I talk to him every now and then. 

Recording: (1231/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that part was no different, man. 

Recording: (1232/ 10721) 
 sort of like the definition of need versus luxury. Those definitions change. The definition of socialism and democracy, they slowly have changed.  over these times. Well the same thing will be true with those. It's still functioning.  And I think we will also slowly swing that pendulum on back to the family again. 

Recording: (1233/ 10721) 
 and people don't. 

Recording: (1234/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1235/ 10721) 
 taking classes. Hopefully that's when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too. 

Recording: (1236/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1237/ 10721) 
 I started this school year off with 27 kindergartners and no aid. 

Recording: (1238/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1239/ 10721) 
 Mmm 

Recording: (1240/ 10721) 
 It has a large gate. It does. 

Recording: (1241/ 10721) 
 I'd say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know, but I don't think that you can say everything.  Everybody has to do this because people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration, I think. 

Recording: (1242/ 10721) 
 absent for the whole day, which would be considered truant. So they said what I had to do was go down to juvenile to the certain  gentleman in juvenile and have him file charges. So I took my son down to him and he said it was a school.  should have did that. So in the meantime, he's telling me that my son's getting ready to go to 11th grade and 

Recording: (1243/ 10721) 
 And the fact that I recognized all that and couldn't wait to get out of there and when I was gone, I was gone. And even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family, in fact,  I've been really happy about them lately because we've lived in our same house for 20 years and my parents, they live in Florida.  I mean, they're not well-to-do by any means, but they're not lacking for anything, and they can afford to take plane trips, and they can afford to go to California twice a year to study. 

Recording: (1244/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1245/ 10721) 
 that encompasses the theory that all things happen for a reason, even though it seems like it's  chaos, even though it seems like it's an accident. There's a flow of spirit in this world. Things  are moving at a pace that they're supposed to move at and things happen. And death is part of life, physical death. And that's 

Recording: (1246/ 10721) 
 Hmm? 

Recording: (1247/ 10721) 
 It's not really an office. He's like a supervisor that just goes to the different job sites. He tells the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready.  and then he gets to talk with the other contractors and he works together with them. But he's really just, there's a main place where they park all their trucks and then  He just goes to the different sites. 

Recording: (1248/ 10721) 
 you know, mixed race or handicapped or, you know, hard to place. 

Recording: (1249/ 10721) 
 Or... 

Recording: (1250/ 10721) 
 at each other's throat for this, that and the other. And you know, Devin is with my daughters and when I really get put in the middle of it, you know, and probably  it was a blessing that they moved to St. Louis because there probably could have been more problems, legal problems, you know, as far as going back and forth to court.  and putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff, you know. So, in hindsight, it was kind of a blessing that they moved there. 

Recording: (1251/ 10721) 
 and a disease that affected her mind. And of course, you know, back then I didn't really know that, but there was a lot of conflict. 

Recording: (1252/ 10721) 
 or like the art shows in Worthington or the crafts or even the Irish Festival in Dublin which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that.  that. The concerts on the river, on the Worthington Green, really anything like that. 

Recording: (1253/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1254/ 10721) 
 And 

Recording: (1255/ 10721) 
 Oh gosh. 

Recording: (1256/ 10721) 
 They didn't know. 

Recording: (1257/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1258/ 10721) 
 Because, I mean, that must be how she raised her kids. You know? And she's... That's what I asked her. She's got a husband. I'm like, so your husband, you believe he cheats? Yeah.  I don't believe that. I think that's terrible. 

Recording: (1259/ 10721) 
 I wouldn't doubt it. I hope they vote against it, but I don't think they will. 

Recording: (1260/ 10721) 
 Well, it's kind of hard when you've got your limited choices here. Some of the issues I thought were kind of important, but when you're looking at the memorial  Did you watch that debate? 

Recording: (1261/ 10721) 
 because it stops your heart right away. 

Recording: (1262/ 10721) 
 They don't have that for Columbus schools. 

Recording: (1263/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they'll just take one scripture and they'll expand it. And they'll just run with that one scripture. And then there are also churches that will just delete.  in their minds they'll delete certain sections of the scripture that they don't like. 1 Corinthians chapter 12 talks about spiritual gifts and that's one of the big things  that I'm into down here in Columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and 

Recording: (1264/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1265/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1266/ 10721) 
 He's going to be there all summer. I didn't decide I wanted to change it over until I got my scanner and found out that when I checked the website for the scanner,  That they're just simply flat-out not making windows 2000 drivers for my scanner so it's a  Crap, I don't know. I just got it. I can't remember what it is. Paper port. I think it's paper port.  Avoid.

 He's running illegal business here. 

Recording: (1268/ 10721) 
 Boy, that's a really tough one. I hadn't thought about that. And high school kids are so touchy about, I mean, about  touching about sexual identity and so insecure in their own that they're really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a different orientation.  Orientation and I don't know I don't know 

Recording: (1269/ 10721) 
 What you do in Australia?

 I'd like to think that maybe even this thing, you know, could be like a sanctuary for him to come in and get some peace of mind or something, you know.  Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1271/ 10721) 
 for the land out there. 

Recording: (1272/ 10721) 
 They didn't want the World War II vision anymore. I thought that was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported Reagan.  understand the difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that Reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did Clinton  So I think for the average voter that does have a lot of sway. 

Recording: (1273/ 10721) 
 We're in the same age, right? 

Recording: (1274/ 10721) 
 And your display might be different, but it's basic information. And we developed a system that people started doing that on and sharing the data. Actually, it started here.  on LSU campus and now we're independent. 

Recording: (1275/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I guess so. I mean, people spend hours on computers doing this type of thing. Let's go down there and see what they can find. 

Recording: (1276/ 10721) 
 I mean that's not to say that I don't like being Catholic or whatever. 

Recording: (1277/ 10721) 
 the electric shock things. 

Recording: (1278/ 10721) 
 No, thank goodness. Or if I did, I blanked it out. 

Recording: (1279/ 10721) 
 Well my husband was allergic when we first got together but I have to admit he has other  So he gets shots and things but you know they always say it's the pet dander.

 Okay. 

Recording: (1281/ 10721) 
 You know.

 But, you know, I knew that they had already made that promise, and there's a lot of businesses that could  move out of that area, you know, and half those taxes come to Columbus.

I mean, I don't know if it's the media that's, you know, kind of portrays us there.  more than there used to be.

Recording: (1594/ 10721) 
 and that's not a life. 

Recording: (1595/ 10721) 
 It wasn't so much of a hate thing, it was just more, these are the people I like to hang out with. If you don't like that, that's fine. 

Recording: (1596/ 10721)

 We needed that.

 It's a lot of money. 

Recording: (1606/ 10721) 
 I think some of it was that I think a lot of it is you do feel lonely. You do go through a period in your life where you don't feel like you have any friends.  or you feel totally different. I mean I still go through that. I think we all go through that at some point or another, even yearly for some of us.  So I'm just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family, I say he using those for example, or

 willing to adopt a black child or a mixed race child or an Asian child or any are going to be sensitive to cultural things.  It's just the way things are slanted these days. I mean, diversity is an issue. And people who are willing to venture  out into mixed-race adoption would already be way hipster. 

Recording: (1610/ 10721) 
 As a teacher, how could you cut down on students and say, no, that's not the way it was? And you're learning from a teacher's guide? No. But how do you know about asking a person?  It's a matter of tradition and handing it down to the tradition itself. It's a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way. And it's not necessarily  say written down but it's passed on those days probably written down or not written down but verbal and extended and so it's that hand

It's just that, you know, the police chief  And I don't like people who try to manipulate facts. And that was manipulating the facts. I didn't like that she was, um,  against the TIF in Polaris. Once it was voted, I thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong, and I don't think it was wrong to begin with. 

Recording: (1623/ 10721) 
 you know, they shouldn't know where the keys are, if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever. I mean, the fact that, you know, how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to  school.

 Okay, okay, it's part of growing up. I've been there, done that too, but still, you have to know there's respect out there to be warranted.  and expect it and not just demand it. You have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it. But then  And then they saw the interaction with the elderly people, the school he went to, there was a lot of public involvement, public service required, the teachers.  Bye.

So I don't really see him during the day.  night he usually goes out and does his thing I go out and do my thing. So I mean as far as what's going on with him I really don't know but I know I mean there's nothing real serious going on with him.

She found out about the ADH just like we all, I guess.  like a couple of the kids in the class had it or on it you know and she's like oh what's that and she's like oh I have to figure out that stuff you know. She called one of the  caseworkers and figured out the whole program and she come in and told another girl about it. She told me about it.

 And I would definitely keep an eye out and figure out what's going on.

Recording: (1650/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1651/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there can't be sanctions for doing the right thing.  And so I'm opposed to that. Well, yeah, I guess you'd have to say that I would be opposed to arresting mothers for  anything in that relation, that it's just that the effort should focus on getting them

 Mm-hmm, sure. 

Recording: (1657/ 10721) 
 Probably a little bit. 

Recording: (1658/ 10721) 
 They just need really positive things when they do go to school and I think teachers are a big part of it. I really do. You remember when you have a good teacher and that you've learned a lot.  And I think through education, because it's hard, all these schools and so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then it always has to do with  money and them not making enough money, which the teachers don't make enough money. And they're overworked in all these big large classrooms. It just seems to me...  When 

Recording: (1659/ 10721)

 Okay, that's a good job. I mean, because you get flex time. Yeah. 

Recording: (1666/ 10721) 
 I well that's a that's a tough one I Remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like  But they were like the Bowery boys and stuff, you know, where you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway, you know, but and to me that's fake  And I never really thought about while I was growing up that it was what was real and everything I always knew that by I dare again, you know by my dad being a

He never was up where he was doing any shooting himself.  you

Recording: (1673/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1674/ 10721) 
 these loose ends that they keep having. I suspect they probably won't do that. They'll leave things open-ended for  future TV movies or maybe another feature-length movie 

Recording: (1675/ 10721) 
 He is. 

Recording: (1676/ 10721) 
 I know.

Recording: (1678/ 10721) 
 I said, there's a big. 

Recording: (1679/ 10721) 
 I'm not giving up hope or nothing like that. I'm just trying to cut through and see what I can do.  It's very limited out there, you know, and your education is an asset. But like I said, even as a person now going through BV,  VR, I'm discriminated against in my opinion because I have a bachelor's. In other words, Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation.

 Oh, yeah, I'm oh I always wear t-shirts. I don't I'm a t-shirt person I don't like things on my arms like I got all like bracelets or anything 

Recording: (1681/ 10721) 
 the part. Now it takes about 50 minutes, but to do all this stretching. 

Recording: (1682/ 10721) 
 Yes, haven't they talked about that here actually? Have they talked about? 

Recording: (1683/ 10721) 
 I'm hoping that'll be the same experience as it is in Ohio State. 

Recording: (1684/ 10721) 
 And I think that sometimes they don't even count all the votes or something and sometimes if they really wanted to go through bad enough, even though the majority voted not for it, I mean, even though the majority doesn't want that to happen.  and somehow or other they'll count it so it did or they'll, you know. 

Recording: (1685/ 10721) 
 like that, like solitary. But like unlimited solitary, that doesn't seem right either. 

Recording: (1686/ 10721) 
 I tried volunteering, you know, picking them up, doing a volunteer thing and I'd get calls all during the night to  go pick these kids up because I thought I was doing something to help but you know you're not helping them.

I don't cause him, and when he's at their house, we'll get in an argument, and that's what makes them not like me, because of the yelling.  and stuff, but I feel like I'm not the one that makes him yell. 

Recording: (1689/ 10721) 
 Control problems Of course there's always a leak somewhere Yeah, well it could be hot water they  send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant, but about now they drain that. It's drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work  work on leaks and stuff. So, they might have drained it and that's why it quit.  Damn right. 

Recording: (1690/ 10721) 
 But there's things that are difficult like there is that where we go we we have a temple too and They can't go in the temple  Well, they can, but they have to fit certain criteria. They have to be baptized and follow all these health codes and all the different codes.  But that's not what they're interested in doing. And that's hard, I think. 

Recording: (1691/ 10721) 
 Well, when you think about the different generations and things, we certainly didn't have the things to worry about that people do now. When I was in elementary and junior high, we would  I never dreamed of anybody having a good gun or even let alone a knife. I mean that and that's violence and that's that goes back to kids and how much time  and effort you put into them. Kids are ignored and pushed aside and they're in the way and there's so many people that don't even want them and then they 

Recording: (1692/ 10721) 
 Yeah, as I was teasing. 

Recording: (1693/ 10721) 
 but I don't see it as negatively affecting me. I still get all the stuff done I need to get done. 

Recording: (1694/ 10721) 
 Yes.

 Yeah.

 Yeah, my dad's a chauvinist pig. But that's... He still is. 

Recording: (1697/ 10721) 
 I mean, it's cheap, people buy so much of it. Like, portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply. I mean, there, you know, the portions are a lot  a lot  It's getting worse there than it was, but I mean, nowhere is it anywhere near, and that is a large part of the problem with the people.  for

 Mmm.

 Yeah, okay. 

Recording: (1700/ 10721) 
 I thought they'd be a lot better. They picked up Ken Griffey and then on top of it, they were good without him. And now they picked him up and they seem to be doing it. They're still struggling.  like I don't understand that. But the Indians are horrible right now. I like I watched the game yesterday and they were  I think they were a few days ago, seven and a half games back from the Chicago White Sox. We watched the game yesterday and I don't know if we have a lot of injuries or anything because I don't really follow the Indians, but... 

Recording: (1701/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1702/ 10721) 
 I could. It might take me a year or two. 

Recording: (1703/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, that's beautiful. 

Recording: (1704/ 10721) 
 So be it. We had the ribbiters out there helping out the GIs. Fine. Team effort, wasn't it? But then after GIs came home, the little A went  back into the house and business saw these idle lines and said, hey, we can do something here. Because in those days, a little lady said, well, I'll go out and get a little odd job.  We want a little thing mom would do pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad was a primary bread winner But she got into some odd jobs just to complement their needs 

Recording: (1705/ 10721) 
 There was pregnant girls in middle school. 

Recording: (1706/ 10721) 
 And I really fault myself for that, but it's made me more aware too. When you look at somebody and say, oh, you would never dream that they, well, I do.  You know, they're in anything I don't put past anybody doing. I really don't, because they just, yeah.  Oh, no, I do because there's some good ones out there. There's some bad ones too, but you know 

Recording: (1707/ 10721) 
 I'm sure the fact that my parents, my mother tries really hard, but my father was an alcoholic, he was a working alcoholic.  he insisted he could drink on the weekends and never miss work, etc. Yeah, there was no problem. But the biggest problem  is the fact that he and I, I've always expected to have some sort of a respect from them. 

Recording: (1708/ 10721) 
 That's my dad has red hair and blue eyes, so. 

Recording: (1709/ 10721) 
 You even got these what stunt guns they're the ones that scare me 

Recording: (1710/ 10721) 
 and the real meaning behind it. 

Recording: (1711/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1712/ 10721) 
 and basically they were three weeks long, they were about four and a half hours. The first one was really long. You know, Jason was, he was like, I can't take this. Last night wasn't so bad.  The first one was a lot of information classroom kind of stuff. He did real well. He was much more interactive  than a lot of the other guys were just kind of, you know, they would sit there and they weren't breathing and they were kind of rolling their eyes and I just think, God, you bunch of bums, you know, it's going to come down to it. 

Recording: (1713/ 10721) 
 Well, they knew all different things. I mean, culturally, you know, it was different music. Of course, I'm in a suburban high school, and since  Cincinnati, you didn't get exposed to much. So that was the biggest thing. Well, of course, they talk funny in the East. But other than that, other than that,  than the culture shock. It wasn't that different. 

Recording: (1714/ 10721) 
 If she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat, I think almost anybody can beat Gore right now, but in an election  Sometimes a weekend is a couple of centuries, a year is an eon, so anything can happen between now and then.  I think Dole had a good chance of being elected because most Americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate, which is basically where Clinton placed 

Recording: (1715/ 10721) 
 because I'm gay, I might be interested in him. That's the height of arrogance. But men feel threatened by that just as I guess women feel threatened by lesbians. I don't  but it's not a mindset I have so it's hard for me to understand. 

Recording: (1716/ 10721) 
 Excuse me. 

Recording: (1717/ 10721) 
 their generation right before me, so we're stuck right in the middle. I don't even think we have a generation.

Recording: (1720/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1721/ 10721) 
 right same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they'll learn their lesson but it's also the parent that has to set the example and there's too many older  folks right now I don't think because of two people had to work outside the house they get home they're aggravated they're upset somebody else had their kids all day and it's it's it's terrible that the  situations got that way. But I do believe that the older people, including our government people and everybody that's at the top, has to set the example. 

Recording: (1722/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1723/ 10721) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (1724/ 10721)

 So Coleman, you know, you had a good record. 

Recording: (1727/ 10721) 
 I was ready to settle down. I wasn't going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that. And lie and cheat and make up stories and he still  does it. I don't and I don't understand why I feel like he's a grown man if he was out don't make up a story and his mother also make you know they're just it's just it's very  for me and that's another reason why I don't want my son going there for much longer. 

Recording: (1728/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1729/ 10721) 
 Now is when I need to be off with them, where we can take them out and run.

 I've already learned an immense amount looking at your URL thing. Okay, so Belgium is a... 

Recording: (1731/ 10721) 
 well, how he felt and knowing that we weren't neglecting him are two different things. We've always emphasized that knowing what's right  or knowing that what's just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one.

 But they're, because they're both government programs. But yeah, but I think, like I said, for the younger people, because it is, because it's not their fault their parents can't get health insurance.  healthcare 

Recording: (1736/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1737/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think the population. In a way, but I think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people.  people in one area. I don't know. I think the main thing that affects me now and since I've been home, I've been reading the paper a lot more and I'm more aware of what's  going on and I really am going to be some kind of activist for, I don't know, a lot of the places that are coming up, the gentleman's clubs and things 

Recording: (1738/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1739/ 10721) 
 That's just one of those myths. I think  that's to make people feel guilty or something. 

Recording: (1740/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1741/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1742/ 10721) 
 It hasn't gone as far as loan sharking, but the thing of it is, it's fun when you win.  And it's still fun when you lose. 

Recording: (1743/ 10721) 
 That's cool. That's the best place where you have to actually work to get there. 

Recording: (1744/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1745/ 10721) 
 Just really not extraordinarily different food necessarily, but just really 

Recording: (1746/ 10721) 
 You know, what are you going to do? You hit that kid, you're going to jail. 

Recording: (1747/ 10721) 
 Hmm 

Recording: (1748/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'd be so frustrated. I probably, oh, I would be really. 

Recording: (1749/ 10721) 
 But... 

Recording: (1750/ 10721) 
 heard that the more conservative Unitarian churches are in New England, around Boston, where it was started. And there are some that are relatively conservative there.  But for the most part, it's what you would call liberal religion. Yeah. Are you? 

Recording: (1751/ 10721) 
 It's supposed to be a, let me see, school for art. 

Recording: (1752/ 10721) 
 I'm serious. 

Recording: (1753/ 10721) 
 here in high school. Ecstasy is a drug I've been hearing about a lot the past year or two and it's definitely something  That's grown. 

Recording: (1754/ 10721) 
 That's what I was actually thinking of, where he takes the pictures on the corner. 

Recording: (1755/ 10721) 
 Not really. He's come to accept it, but it was her decision.  It's one thing to know that it's the best thing for the baby, but it's another thing my wife and I are trying to deal with emotionally. We're very family oriented, that this is a grandchild we'll never get to see.  seat watch grow up. That's very hard on us. But it is an open adoption. They've met the couple several times. They promised to send pictures and 

Recording: (1756/ 10721) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (1757/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1758/ 10721) 
 But full time, I would definitely go back when he's in school. 

Recording: (1759/ 10721) 
 She figures, well, you know, that kind of makes up for me not working. 

Recording: (1760/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I'm like, oh, this is really interesting, you know, and then I'll drive along and people are just like, ah, blowing the horns. And I'm like, well, I could care less. 

Recording: (1761/ 10721) 
 I had French in the sixth grade and I got A's. I had German and Spanish in the seventh grade. And then in the eighth grade I had French.  In the ninth grade I had French, in the tenth grade I had French, and my junior year of high school I had French. And my grades went B's, straight B's.  C's straight C's D's straight D's and I said I think I should get out now and I stopped taking I didn't take French my senior year but then the arts and sciences came around and said you will have it for him 

Recording: (1762/ 10721) 
 This poor... 

Recording: (1763/ 10721) 
 So right there, you're over me. 

Recording: (1764/ 10721) 
 I'm trying to come up with like a  narrative that's both fun and brief. Okay, so my friend Chris and I are upstairs playing on the computer and my sister's downstairs watching television. It's  Sunday morning and I am trying to figure out how this game works, trying to figure out how this game works, and then I said, I've got some information on this game out in the car, I'm gonna go get it. 

Recording: (1765/ 10721) 
 Drink around the world. Oh boy. 

Recording: (1766/ 10721) 
 I want you to be a man, you know, play basketball. 

Recording: (1767/ 10721) 
 But since all the moms have gone to work and let the TV become the electronic babysitter, and the other thing that's happening is kids do not know things now.  that you'd expect them to know, like, because their moms aren't reading to them. Like, they don't know who Winnie the Pooh is. 

Recording: (1768/ 10721) 
 And I wouldn't be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here. 

Recording: (1769/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think it is further east than where I was. I was right in the Ural Mountains, so it's like the border of Europe and Asia. 

Recording: (1770/ 10721) 
 There'd been a small raised place out there. And what I remember about it is one morning, Dad went out to milk.  and the milk cows were out on that island. 

Recording: (1771/ 10721) 
 If I'd grown up with them, maybe they'd have that thing going on that my sister has, which is a bunch of shared mutual experiences. But as it stands, they're just weird. 

Recording: (1772/ 10721) 
 to  I have to do it too or whatever. 

Recording: (1773/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (1774/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that. 

Recording: (1775/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I could skip any program I wanted to. You know, just show up at the parties, basically. 

Recording: (1776/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1777/ 10721) 
 bashing with him. There wouldn't have been what happened to the black man in Jasper, Texas and the shepherd boy in what  was that Oklahoma. He wouldn't have. 

Recording: (1778/ 10721) 
 Well, there that went, you know. Why, I mean, you can't even have nice stuff in your car anymore. 

Recording: (1779/ 10721) 
 relationships, don't have a girlfriend, don't have a wife, nothing like that. I've got a dog, a golden retriever. 

Recording: (1780/ 10721) 
 ferme. 

Recording: (1781/ 10721) 
 or put you in peak or something, if there's any problems between students, I don't think they never would sit down with the students and have them talk it out.  You know, they might send them to peak or something. 

Recording: (1782/ 10721) 
 Music during the summer, but they'll have regular worship service. I think they're 1030 now during the summer  Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1783/ 10721) 
 I still think I'll baptize in my fires. But I guess you survived okay because you're here. You're still teaching. 

Recording: (1784/ 10721) 
 I'm here. 

Recording: (1785/ 10721) 
 That's perfect. 

Recording: (1786/ 10721) 
 and you can say well that's how that makes you feel when someone goes, hey we're having ham, I hate ham, the other night I had ham and I threw up and blah blah blah and my mom made  I made it and I threw up all over the floor and I'm like, don't you ever do that when you're at someone else's house. 

Recording: (1787/ 10721) 
 He never said much about it, except he told about one time when he was in the hospital up in Japan.  after he was burned. He said that he was in a ward with a bunch of other burn patients and he said  And some of them, him included, were able to get up and walk around. So the—and I can see their philosophy. 

Recording: (1788/ 10721) 
 Not knowing if they're gonna whip out a gun or not, he ain't gonna go to jail. 

Recording: (1789/ 10721) 
 little bit 

Recording: (1790/ 10721) 
 anybody who just wants to connect to us. 

Recording: (1791/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1792/ 10721) 
 It is and it isn't because I see where he is and he's really messed up and I can't do anything for him.  But I've you know, I've I'm open to a relationship with them 

Recording: (1793/ 10721) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (1794/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1795/ 10721) 
 I forgot you guys have like a big kangaroo population. You know, like Ohio has like all these deer and stuff. So it's like they have 

Recording: (1796/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1797/ 10721) 
 I like management here. 

Recording: (1798/ 10721) 
 But they kept saying well, what do you want these taxes for if you're not going to provide for schools? So he was very concerned about that. So here was a case in my opinion a very very  honest politician, but he was also being shoved away from what he felt was an honest approach. 

Recording: (1799/ 10721) 
 Well, I 

Recording: (1800/ 10721) 
 seminaries in the US, and it's a Republican think tank. So aside from the college, the town is pretty much  agricultural. I don't know why anybody would want to live there unless they're raising a family. Because if they're raising a family, it's a great place. Great community.  So are you thinking you might move back there or are you just looking to find a place that's similar to that? 

Recording: (1801/ 10721) 
 It used to be you lived in a little neighborhood, you knew all your neighbors. You don't have that now, everybody's mobile. 

Recording: (1802/ 10721) 
 Edward IV. 

Recording: (1803/ 10721) 
 that kind of thing. 

Recording: (1804/ 10721) 
 right? 

Recording: (1805/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1806/ 10721) 
 Because I think it's Archie Griffin that went to a really crummy school in Columbus. And to me, no matter how bad of an area you live in and bad a school you think,  think you're going to, if you want to do it, you can. Because really in public schools, if you have a learning disability, or if you have problems reading  or you have problems at home, there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you. And in like Worthington and Westerville, Dublin, you know, they don't 

Recording: (1807/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (1808/ 10721) 
 And I got about maybe three miles down the road and a cop pulls up just searing rain. 

Recording: (1809/ 10721) 
 Grandview has its own school system too. 

Recording: (1810/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1811/ 10721) 
 Just kidding. 

Recording: (1812/ 10721) 
 We actually were from Columbus and we moved down to Athens and they moved back a pair one house in the server  Air Force. I was in 69 to 72, so then I was  in two years' reserves, basically electronic, not an engineer, but electronic assembly and stuff like that, missile systems analysis, whatever. 

Recording: (1813/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (1814/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1815/ 10721) 
 what his background really was. 

Recording: (1816/ 10721) 
 And they've met the couple that's going to adopt the baby, which seems kind of odd to me. 

Recording: (1817/ 10721) 
 And he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends. We still see them a lot. And we were close with their parents. 

Recording: (1818/ 10721) 
 his dad pays her for the babysitting, because I can't afford it. 

Recording: (1819/ 10721) 
 uh... i don't know 

Recording: (1820/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (1821/ 10721) 
 I would have a hard time believing that. I mean if the person knew, I would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and  And that was important to them and they prayed and 

Recording: (1822/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1823/ 10721) 
 back then I was working at a cycle shop, but I was in the service while I was working there. 

Recording: (1824/ 10721) 
 great guy but he sure liked to get drunk you know and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk 

Recording: (1825/ 10721) 
 I can't see it. 

Recording: (1826/ 10721) 
 I don't think so. 

Recording: (1827/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1828/ 10721) 
 to stop without it. And that's too bad, you know, that things have been that bad in some, like, a world  War II. I mean, we didn't really have any choice there. But some of the  some of our wars have been unnecessary. But you can get a philosophy, but 

Recording: (1829/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1830/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1831/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1832/ 10721) 
 And the other one is a working cuff at the Steubenville, Ohio. 

Recording: (1833/ 10721) 
 where I don't think that there's any question they could look right down our throats because, and anyway, we fired a couple times from there.  They started firing back at us and man, scared me. 

Recording: (1834/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.  of an acquaintance of mine that's kind of a headhunter and I've given him the idea that I want to either work for an attorney that's going to make some changes or do  something that way. I've got a lot of administration and manager and things like that background. So I can have fun doing what I know how to do but also 

Recording: (1835/ 10721) 
 The population is much different, yes. 

Recording: (1836/ 10721) 
 Okay! 

Recording: (1837/ 10721) 
 We like to cook. I do. I like to cook. I enjoy cooking. 

Recording: (1838/ 10721) 
 I play lottery once in a while if I have a couple bucks on me. And, uh, well, football games, we won't even start with that. 

Recording: (1839/ 10721) 
 But there's a couple places that are just way out in the middle of nowhere and you have to take a four-wheel drive to get there. 

Recording: (1840/ 10721) 
 like I should have stuck in there, but I couldn't deal with it anymore. I'd go home and want to cry.  These were all adults older than me and it was just, it was really silly. 

Recording: (1841/ 10721) 
 even doing none of that anymore. So it's very frustrating for us. And the baby they're giving up for adoption. So that's a whole different problem. 

Recording: (1842/ 10721) 
 and it was fun. I met a lot of neat people. In fact, that's where I met the woman whose child I took care of. She was one of the artists who came to me. But nobody was going to make any money on  on it and it was the kind of thing that it was a project I started when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because I needed a new project and I didn't know anything about it I'd never  I've never even been in a gallery. I thought, this will be fun. I'll just rent this space, because I found this space and I was trying to think of something I could do with it. 

Recording: (1843/ 10721) 
 And I said, no, no you're not. 

Recording: (1844/ 10721) 
 It's open 24 hours, so there's people that, you know, it's like shifts overlap, you know, it's not like everybody leaves and then everybody comes in, you know, it's like.  Like when we're there like the night shift people start to come in people who work from like 8 to 4 8 8 p.m. To 4 a.m. And that'd be really weird. I guess like nobody calls then  or something like 10 people call so she's like it's easy she's like I get paid to 

Recording: (1845/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1846/ 10721) 
 and not all of them are Vietnam vets either. 

Recording: (1847/ 10721) 
 Just like almost out of control. 

Recording: (1848/ 10721) 
 Really? 

Recording: (1849/ 10721) 
 Oh, every day. Every day there was something. It's like I felt like I knew more about Clinton's sex life than I knew about my own.  It was far more than I wanted to know about anybody else's. Whereas in the past there's been  since I had a fear the press never acknowledged it even if they knew it. At least that's what you know. 

Recording: (1850/ 10721) 
 bad they were, you know. They laid a hand on her, of course, you know, but, but by her being away, you  know then and her mom's got a cool head on her shoulder she wouldn't let that happen unless she told me about it and she'd be probably afraid to tell me that catching  airplane flight down over there or something, you know, hook the guy up or something. 

Recording: (1851/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1852/ 10721) 
 Fort Hayes. 

Recording: (1853/ 10721) 
 Really? They are the biggest assholes. 

Recording: (1854/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we're going to have to give it up by Friday. Because the strike's over. They won't let us keep it anymore. 

Recording: (1855/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there's no distinction. 

Recording: (1856/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah They you love to hate him or love him one other I think he's a great coach  Think he does some stupid things, but we all do 

Recording: (1857/ 10721) 
 When I was teaching it, that was kind of before all the moms went to work. 

Recording: (1858/ 10721) 
 because like I said it all came together because I don't understand how people can let their kids be hurt. 

Recording: (1859/ 10721) 
 Oh, there's a lot of racism. 

Recording: (1860/ 10721) 
 It was, well it started out as computer science under the College of Arts and Sciences, but then there was this whole foreign language requirement and a bad  incident with a counselor and eventually I became a proud member of the College of Business. 

Recording: (1861/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1862/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1863/ 10721) 
 And then, like people who work go back until like, you know, maybe two to six. The kids are done with school for the day at like 12 or one. 

Recording: (1864/ 10721) 
 You know, you got two adults in your house, it doesn't matter what gender they are. 

Recording: (1865/ 10721) 
 for the system they have now. Keep punching the old card data into that. That was my first library job. 

Recording: (1866/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1867/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's kind of fun. 

Recording: (1868/ 10721) 
 mom and sister move out to California. 

Recording: (1869/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (1870/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1871/ 10721) 
 didn't get vaccinated in time. And he was just covered with those sores for I don't know how long. Mom said that  But after the scabs started falling off of him, he'd get out of the bed and take the sheet out in the yard and shake it to get those scabs off.  off. But uh, 

Recording: (1872/ 10721) 
 Like if our system would shut down, it would cost us tens of thousands of dollars for every hour that we're down.  trashed, our main database would be trashed, we'd have real serious problems and it could take weeks or months to rebuild it. Yeah, so it could be a problem.  good people working in that area. 

Recording: (1873/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you always still gonna have I was like when we were kids Like me and you would meet we'd get in a fight and after that we'd be best friends now You know, I'd be walking down the street and hell 14-year-olds  old scare me to death right now. 

Recording: (1874/ 10721) 
 and they were in Italy and Europe, and there wasn't the definite enemy.  in Vietnam that there was in Europe. I think that's part of it. And, of course, the attitude of most of the  guys that went to Vietnam was a little bit different from us, probably as a consequence of our understanding of the 

Recording: (1875/ 10721) 
 Probably Northwest area. 

Recording: (1876/ 10721) 
 It's like your 18-month-old daughter, you have to amuse them and distract them. 

Recording: (1877/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's true. I had Janssen, and I went to art school, so Janssen was just in case you had to look something up, it was there.  lecturers were all pretty liberal, so that the art history we got was different than what would just be in Janssen. So I never thought about that.  But... 

Recording: (1878/ 10721) 
 My son, now I saw him when, let's see, he was 15 maybe, he'd run across the street when Martha, the 86-year-old lady across the street, was trying  bring her garbage down. He'd seen me do that. He'd go, oh, let me get that for you, Martha. She's got arthritis. She looks like she's going to fall. She takes steps about this big.  And I've seen him do that. 

Recording: (1879/ 10721) 
 not really uh... i'm more into it morbid at the door in the music like uh... since i i i i got a  So called raves or whatever. Yeah, like I'm really like into that like just that type of music and I don't know. I haven't really  played music in a while because I'm starting to get back into it, just doing different things. 

Recording: (1880/ 10721) 
 I don't know, I mean I was actually looking at that Riser military and they started popping up all this abuse stuff and I was like, man, darn it.  My aunt 

Recording: (1881/ 10721) 
 a township trustee, Jersey Township, which is just over in Licking County. And this gentleman is 86 years old.  three or four years of age and he's been a township trustee various times throughout his life and he is very very concerned because of  of the exploding. He's a farmer, has been a farmer all of his life. He owns about 150 acres adjacent 

Recording: (1882/ 10721) 
 And most of the time they were putting them in charge. Well, like we get, no offense, we get these college students coming out that were second lieutenants that thought they'd know everything. 

Recording: (1883/ 10721) 
 I've noticed, or I would say lack of noticed in any other city in the United States, why in the world do they have to work on all the roads all at the same time? I don't  understand they have to they're working on 315 270 70 71 670 all the same time why why  I can't understand it. You'd think that there would be some central planning going on there. Yeah. Apparently not. Anyway, um, okay, um...  Our time is about up, unless you have anything burning to say. 

Recording: (1884/ 10721) 
 You know? 

Recording: (1885/ 10721) 
 Do you guys like shoot them? Have like kangaroo season? 

Recording: (1886/ 10721) 
 Mhm. Right. 

Recording: (1887/ 10721) 
 he described in there. 

Recording: (1888/ 10721) 
 Right, that's true. 

Recording: (1889/ 10721) 
 So let's say she was in a situation where she had some sort of bills to pay, you know, the one environment was much more close-knit.  I'm sure somewhere, I'm sure somewhere.  somewhere along the line, they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps. It wouldn't be long term. And they would know that it would not be long term. But that's that 

Recording: (1890/ 10721) 
 and I was crying the whole time, just that little pain. My mom was laughing at me. It wasn't funny.  they left out parts. You know if you talk to people when they have babies and they, oh it's the worst pain but you'll forget about it. They left out that whole part where they put the epidural  you and you 

Recording: (1891/ 10721) 
 right? 

Recording: (1892/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (1893/ 10721) 
 The rail service, no. 

Recording: (1894/ 10721) 
 It is? 

Recording: (1895/ 10721) 
 We had one of the parties up there, and they had this big pyramid-shaped thing. I forget what they call it. It's like a crystal or something. I don't know, but they have a speaker hook up.  up  He was like, ah! 

Recording: (1896/ 10721) 
 before we got, this was our first house. 

Recording: (1897/ 10721) 
 That would be neat, that would be real neat. But that's Dreamworld, so. 

Recording: (1898/ 10721) 
 I hop you hop. 

Recording: (1899/ 10721) 
 amazing how much the growth in Delaware and different areas when I was growing up here and how Marysville was such a farm town. Just the growth of the different cities and  suburbs of Columbus is amazing and the housing and 

Recording: (1900/ 10721) 
 living and going to those schools because it's very expensive to live in that area. So there's a natural prejudice that Columbus is stupid and worthy to Dublin and it's really not true. It's just  that you can't tell all the poor people and the people who don't have two parents don't come to school because we want our scores higher. But when the news media goes, look how bad Brown's  Brown School did this year, but they don't look to see like Jelena. They don't go, well, look at the scores on the California Achievement Test. There's like 75% of the kids that are getting 

Recording: (1901/ 10721) 
 for over five years on purpose. I don't think it was supposed to be that long on purpose, but I wouldn't let myself date for a couple years after just trying to figure out. 

Recording: (1902/ 10721) 
 Okay, okay. 

Recording: (1903/ 10721) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (1904/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1905/ 10721) 
 Um, oh. 

Recording: (1906/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1907/ 10721) 
 In the home. 

Recording: (1908/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah, she's 19. Yeah. 

Recording: (1909/ 10721) 
 There was other things. Right, yeah. Like we had our service. We'd clean up neighborhoods. Yeah, there was a lot of different things. 

Recording: (1910/ 10721) 
 Picket bodies. 

Recording: (1911/ 10721) 
 In fact, the desk that she had, we finished off part of her basement. She had her office down there.  And her desk is still down there, and one of the typewriters that she used, but it's, I don't know, it's been disused for too long, I guess,  I've tried to type on it. It doesn't shift like it should. But anyway, she had, I don't know how many of these 

Recording: (1912/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1913/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah. 

Recording: (1914/ 10721) 
 That's nice. 

Recording: (1915/ 10721) 
 Okay. And always made choices for himself. But as far as motivated for school now, he's always motivated toward a career.  Yeah, he grew up here. 

Recording: (1916/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (1917/ 10721) 
 Yeah, the medical school has pretty much limited them to 10% of the 

Recording: (1918/ 10721) 
 You're coming with me. 

Recording: (1919/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1920/ 10721) 
 She said I'd talk to the devil. 

Recording: (1921/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1922/ 10721) 
 I don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything like that. But as far as morals and the right thing to do in life.  what's out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but. 

Recording: (1923/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (1924/ 10721) 
 He really doesn't like it, like how things work. 

Recording: (1925/ 10721) 
 Periodically, they would have to clean those out because the fan would draw, in addition to fumes, they would draw some lint off of this.  So he was up on top of one of these rollers cleaning out the hood with supposedly non-flammable  solvent. 

Recording: (1926/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1927/ 10721) 
 Just travel to Australia maybe. Just for a few months. You hear these stories.  Europe. Did you ever do the backpacking bit? 

Recording: (1928/ 10721) 
 yeah that was all woods and everything back then nobody wanted to live up in there it was a trash area 

Recording: (1929/ 10721) 
 as back in the high school. 

Recording: (1930/ 10721) 
 Yeah. But it's like, I mean, there's these stories almost every day you hear them. And that's, I mean, that's even a big change from five years ago.  or ten years ago. 

Recording: (1931/ 10721) 
 And the lower you are, apparently, the easier it is or something. That was the coach's philosophy anyway. 

Recording: (1932/ 10721) 
 judges are bought and paid for, they're elected. There's a lot of crap there and I learned all this not from just my experience but from people  that I know that are attorneys, that there are judges down there that take bribes. And that's not right. So you can't, when you're dealing with that system,  Justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident, you know laws are 

Recording: (1933/ 10721) 
 Well, clown cone isn't there anymore. Clown cone, you could get a bag of Tootsie Rolls and pay only five cents.  That's gone. That was a kid thing. My grandfather used to own an amendment market. 

Recording: (1934/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well like, um... 

Recording: (1935/ 10721) 
 the two-parter last season where it was they advertised as full disclosure. 

Recording: (1936/ 10721) 
 I think I was at that Penn State game. I have a cousin who is a golf pro over near Penn State. 

Recording: (1937/ 10721) 
 That's a vestibule. Does your animal eat those? My animal eats mostly vestibules. 

Recording: (1938/ 10721) 
 If you work at a college or a hospital, you make no money. Yeah, pretty much.  seems like it. I wanted to for a long time. Now I'm just not so sure that I want the two or three more years of school. They suggest two to three years for your PhD.  I don't want to do that. 

Recording: (1939/ 10721) 
 to turn on the news. They don't really cover. My husband comes from a journalistic background and he'll be like that's not news. You know what I mean. It's just we get so let's  here and watch a plane crash for 12 hours instead of watching I don't know what Little House on the Prairie. I don't know. I'm being facetious but yeah.  You know what I mean? 

Recording: (1940/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. They said.  it's going to be hard to do in some of the other states, but I don't think so. 

Recording: (1941/ 10721) 
 Also too, when's the last time you've seen a baseball game? Kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood. 

Recording: (1942/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1943/ 10721) 
 That's why I don't get to. 

Recording: (1944/ 10721) 
 inherently wrong to me. 

Recording: (1945/ 10721) 
 so I'm not going to get too much of an attitude from people. 

Recording: (1946/ 10721) 
 Namaste. 

Recording: (1947/ 10721) 
 Well, I've found that people from outside of the United States have stereotypes about the United States.  and when they actually get to know someone, those stereotypes dissipate. I mean, I actually had a conversation very similar to this the other night.  it 

Recording: (1948/ 10721) 
 And they stopped doing that now. 

Recording: (1949/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1950/ 10721) 
 I was in Columbus for the first six years I taught. 

Recording: (1951/ 10721) 
 how to step by step of how to commit suicide. Yeah, they have to be responsible, I think. Because you put an idea into somebody's head and then when you give them the resources,  to carry these things out. I think it has to be responsible for a lot of it. 

Recording: (1952/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1953/ 10721) 
 and 

Recording: (1954/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1955/ 10721) 
 I play the French horn. I don't think I said that before. And I sing tenor and  mostly choir stuff, but I've done a few small solo things. 

Recording: (1956/ 10721) 
 Oh, the top. I think that he lost her foot. 

Recording: (1957/ 10721) 
 I just want to sit and not do anything. Working out is hard. So I want to have a job where if I don't have time  I'm working out sort of like during my job and like I really hate talking on the phone now like having jobs for  while 

Recording: (1958/ 10721) 
 I've done it for the last five years. 

Recording: (1959/ 10721) 
 people were constantly on me about, oh, why are Americans so fat? And like all these things on the television about the Americans. And I mean, that was never ending. 

Recording: (1960/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1961/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1962/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean it was a really long time ago, everything's fine, but I guess for me, I just, I don't know, it was just a little more than I wanted to see.  The classes I think were helpful, but would you ask me? 

Recording: (1963/ 10721) 
 Um, my, both of them are older. My sister's like 27, 28. My brother's 24. 

Recording: (1964/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1965/ 10721) 
 So, I mean, he's responding. 

Recording: (1966/ 10721) 
 Well, we were in North Africa first for the North African campaign when Romer was still roaming.  That ended up in the summer of 1942, I believe, and then we were sent to  to Italy, I was in a field artillery outfit, six-inch guns. 

Recording: (1967/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1968/ 10721) 
 Okay, fine. And the family probably said, okay, we want your advancement, we want your goodwill. The problem is you ran up a culture difference.  The culture difference is over here and so forth. And then we became a little more promiscuous. And so gee, you know, mom, dad and so forth, they don't know what's going on here in the West Coast.  with us and so forth and they think everything is going okay because we didn't have communication as frequent and then all of a sudden you find out and usually mom found out 

Recording: (1969/ 10721) 
 Oh, like, yeah, really? 

Recording: (1970/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (1971/ 10721) 
 Sure! 

Recording: (1972/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they don't know about it but then, you know, they, like you said, they don't want to see it. 

Recording: (1973/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1974/ 10721) 
 And he knew it was a bullshit war. 

Recording: (1975/ 10721) 
 I'm rusty. 

Recording: (1976/ 10721) 
 I know. 

Recording: (1977/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1978/ 10721) 
 They are good. 

Recording: (1979/ 10721) 
 that you really can get a lot out of it if that's something you want to do. And I think as long as you're involved with the school. 

Recording: (1980/ 10721) 
 now. 

Recording: (1981/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (1982/ 10721) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (1983/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1984/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they really like it. They have a huge house in the middle of nowhere out on a farm. My brother-in-law bought his father's  Wendy's business is out and so they own like six Wendy's out there so but it's out in the middle of nowhere that was the whole problem he tried to get him to move and tried to  get him to do this years and years ago and nobody wanted to move to Nebraska. He was doing them from Ohio, which is really tough, running five Wendy's in 

Recording: (1985/ 10721) 
 trying to raise my hopes up about it, but then they had this other kid who was actually really into veterinary medicine and flying helicopters.  all that and he really did go on to study about that myself, Cook.  you 

Recording: (1986/ 10721) 
 Well, that's an interesting thing. I'm not in geology right now. I'm actually making more money right now in music than I am  in geology, but I'm making most of my money in something that's irrelevant to most of my, that has nothing to do with any of my studies. Yes, I, I play  I play principal horn in the Symphony Orchestra. Last year I was in a professional singing group. 

Recording: (1987/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (1988/ 10721) 
 We were floating around just didn't know if they were going to send us in or not because it was toward the end of it. 

Recording: (1989/ 10721) 
 Oh, that's it. 

Recording: (1990/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I'm closer to the ones that feel the same way I do about things. My oldest sister, you know, I could stay on the phone so long, but we have such different opinions about things that  Yeah, I don't stay on very long with her. 

Recording: (1991/ 10721) 
 So that means you're a good problem solver, you're a good logical thinker, you're good in science, you're good in math, you know. So there's a few things you're not good at. It doesn't mean you're  I'd much rather be stranded on an island with six other people. 

Recording: (1992/ 10721) 
 And well, the people that own it are starting to build it up now. But it's been like that. It was the first apartment community in Columbia.  It was built in 38, I guess. 

Recording: (1993/ 10721) 
 Oh, that's so nice. 

Recording: (1994/ 10721) 
 Hehehe 

Recording: (1995/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1996/ 10721) 
 I don't argue with them, I don't debate it, it's just like... it might. 

Recording: (1997/ 10721) 
 That's probably when they started, yeah. 

Recording: (1998/ 10721) 
 They just, I'm not sure really what they do. 

Recording: (1999/ 10721) 
 mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so he's like I think we should talk I was like okay great because I was like yeah boy you're way too serious for  this particular affair. Okay, that's fine. We knew ahead of time that this was all coming to an end. Don't worry about it. So I, at this point in the story, I should point out that the paper that I went downstairs for,  I don't know where that is. I never found it. Never saw it. Never. It's anyway not relevant in all the story, but it bugs me every time I tell the story because doesn't exist anyway 

Recording: (2000/ 10721) 
 And that kind of thing I think is pretty important just because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are doing it, so at least, at the very least, they might have  as well be safe about it. 

Recording: (2001/ 10721) 
んん? 

Recording: (2002/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (2003/ 10721) 
 That's right. 

Recording: (2004/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that was after I got kicked out and I just decided I'll go to work for a couple months. Make something out of it. I learned to trade. 

Recording: (2005/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2006/ 10721) 
 person on she's pretty high up I guess I was unaware 

Recording: (2007/ 10721) 
 Bye! 

Recording: (2008/ 10721) 
 He went to Columbus schools and the kid didn't know what he had. He just found it laying around his father's car in the glove compartment, brought it in to show the other kids.  That was very upsetting to my son. He's very sensitive. He used to be. Again, I don't know if that's normal for teenagers.  or not, but he used to be very sensitive to other people. But I don't think, I don't know if he is or he just doesn't want 

Recording: (2009/ 10721) 
 that dot it's gonna be just the opposite in heaven I can't think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can't think of a negative thing about them  because you see Christ's appearance comes through them. 

Recording: (2010/ 10721) 
 I was born in Dayton, Ohio. I lived there almost 35 years before moving to Columbus in 1981.  I lived in northwest Columbus for 18 years. I moved last January a little farther west, about five miles further west near Hilliard, but still live in the city of  Columbus. I've been here about 18, 19 years. I like Columbus also. I think it's a great city, although the last three months I've threatened to move on more than one 

Recording: (2011/ 10721) 
 a mentor of any kind even. My wife, she wants to go to school. My wife's agreed to go with her when she goes for the interviews and stuff. She says she doesn't know what to ask or  anything. 

Recording: (2012/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that was the most somebody could be ordered to pay, being unemployed. 

Recording: (2013/ 10721) 
 I grew up in, is this registering? It slipped. 

Recording: (2014/ 10721) 
 That's the Appalachian area. It'd be great if somebody, you know, they'd want to pump all this money into it, but unfortunately, whenever the government pumps money into an area, you know,  It tends to be like a foreign country gets it, you know. 

Recording: (2015/ 10721) 
 Yeah, my sister and her husband just moved back. They went out to Nebraska for a year. 

Recording: (2016/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they're really good about that. 

Recording: (2017/ 10721) 
 They're all in business. They work. They're scattered. I have a son in Sacramento and a son in  Atlanta, Georgia. 

Recording: (2018/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2019/ 10721) 
 I just think it's sad even here in Columbus, you know, like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools. And I thought, you know, I just, you know, it's just because  of all the things you've seen in the world in the last year, that these kids want to do this just to see what's going to happen. 

Recording: (2020/ 10721) 
 And they say that's a city. And my school, or where I grew up, was more than double that, just over double that. It was like 60,000. 

Recording: (2021/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2022/ 10721) 
 I  I used to be so bad about it and now all of a sudden I don't care really. 

Recording: (2023/ 10721) 
 Green Bay Packers. 

Recording: (2024/ 10721) 
 Okay 

Recording: (2025/ 10721) 
 a land, the finance company owns it, you don't own it, you're leasing it. And that's our quality of life. And when we go to third world countries, we say, I don't know how they can stand living here.  And yet, you know what? They probably have better quality of understanding one another than we do. Because I feel like the more you get closer to one another, the further you become apart. 

Recording: (2026/ 10721) 
 they won't take proper advantage of it because they have their parents to look up to who didn't take advantage of it. 

Recording: (2027/ 10721) 
 be running the country in our old age. We'll be sitting in a rocking chair and they'll be running the country so you better teach them well when you look at it like that. 

Recording: (2028/ 10721) 
 I didn't like it, but I liked elements of it. Unlike the first Star Wars movie, this one really is meant to be  be part of a trilogy. The first Star Wars movie when it came out, I mean, it was in many ways an experiment. It was part of a larger story. 

Recording: (2029/ 10721) 
 and I'm hoping to get, I'm gonna get a puppy and a kitten together. 

Recording: (2030/ 10721) 
 Well, number one, it's a little bit smaller, more controlled area. Quiet, no less. And get my mom closer to the system.  My sister lives up there. She moved there from down in West Virginia. So, you know, with mom having all  the peace and quiet she wants, plus in a place that's only a year old. 

Recording: (2031/ 10721) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (2032/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (2033/ 10721) 
 You know, how far they held responsible, I don't know. You'd have to go on a case-by-case basis. 

Recording: (2034/ 10721) 
 and come back in. 

Recording: (2035/ 10721) 
 than anything. 

Recording: (2036/ 10721) 
 And I got a letter from my attorney and he said that, and also a phone call from the office saying that  that they were filing a continuance, which meant that the judge granted them an additional  year of discovery. Whatever the law says, the judge says he 

Recording: (2037/ 10721) 
 from the day one. 

Recording: (2038/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (2039/ 10721) 
 You know what, my parents never did because they knew I was always level-headed. I always had a lot of boyfriends, you know, but I always felt like I was waiting for the right one.  one. 

Recording: (2040/ 10721) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (2041/ 10721) 
 Richmond and Virginia? Okay. Their home base is in Richmond, Virginia. And if they open up the intern program, like I'm hoping they will, then I'll go down there.  and  Hopefully I'm going to go back to law school and get a law degree because I did mock trial in high school and I love it. I love law. Absolutely love law and I'm good at it. 

Recording: (2042/ 10721) 
 Uh-uh. 

Recording: (2043/ 10721) 
 And so you had. 

Recording: (2044/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I remember political correctness. 

Recording: (2045/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2046/ 10721) 
 what I paid for it, I now owe three times that amount on it. 

Recording: (2047/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it sucked. 

Recording: (2048/ 10721) 
 of dialogue under one of their cartoons, and the cartoon told most of it. 

Recording: (2049/ 10721) 
 okay, now we know where you're coming from. And they'll make it really easy for you. Because if they just zoom out some phraseology and you go, 98 Juliet, which is how you respond with  It's a call sign a year plane. 

Recording: (2050/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (2051/ 10721) 
 No, not often. My daughter has a very intense life, and so I don't see them nearly as often.  as often as I like. We just do a one day thing because it's fairly easy to drive to Toledo. So I go real early in the morning and  spend six or seven hours with them and then come back. And or she does the same thing. She comes down here and we just do the one day thing now. 

Recording: (2052/ 10721) 
 which was scheduled in the evenings when I was working, and I couldn't even go to therapy. 

Recording: (2053/ 10721) 
 Sure. 

Recording: (2054/ 10721) 
 Oxlux is probably the closest place. 

Recording: (2055/ 10721) 
 the age 17 maybe. I think they should have a parent's consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a  mistake it's gonna be if she's gonna be a young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother, you know, I mean There's a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them  There's so much of that for a while there that was going on and it's like, I can't believe these women are doing this. They just snap. 

Recording: (2056/ 10721) 
 It hurt too! 

Recording: (2057/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2058/ 10721) 
 It is, yeah. 

Recording: (2059/ 10721) 
 sort of thing. But I mean too many people have guns here. There's too much of a, in my opinion, you know, there's too much of a gun culture. I mean over there,  They've pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things. And the fact that, you know, of course there are some floating around, but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do  that obviously England is such a small country in comparison, but I mean that's just amazing to me. But it's true, I mean the fact that he 

Recording: (2060/ 10721) 
 Because they're so stylish. 

Recording: (2061/ 10721) 
 He traced freight whatever that means. 

Recording: (2062/ 10721) 
 Boy, it would have to be something that I actually enjoy. What happened was, ever since I came to Columbus, almost every company I worked for was  bought out and sold and moved to a different state and I wasn't interested in that because my husband works for the state so obviously he's not going anywhere. So I got tired  that and that's why I kind of went to dumping and stuff so it would be one with variety I'm unfortunately I say unfortunately good at accounting and 

Recording: (2063/ 10721) 
 At our desk we had terminals that connected to a system. 

Recording: (2064/ 10721) 
 All right, number one, none of them had the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted. When they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car, they had their car. They were not allowed to have my car.  and take it and run over to this kid's house or that kid's house. 

Recording: (2065/ 10721) 
 Oh, you know what those areas? 

Recording: (2066/ 10721) 
 seen all the nice things just everywhere. I couldn't believe it. But now it's easy to take it for granted again. Just, I'm back home. 

Recording: (2067/ 10721) 
 I don't know. It just seemed easier, you know life was I don't know It just wasn't the driving is the main issue with me, you know, the freeways we have here weren't  built for the amount of people that travel on them now. I remember when they built 71 North. I remember when they built 70 East. There were no freeways.  I remember going up 315 when they first opened it and it was like nobody was on it. You could just drive on it. It was like an empty road. 

Recording: (2068/ 10721) 
 And then I was in Tennessee for, I don't know, a year. 

Recording: (2069/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's why that was your question. Are we going to have doom? We're going to have a catastrophe We're going to get this thing turned around before we have yes, I think we will but I don't  I don't think we're ready to turn around yet. I think we're still, well, this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four or five  times. It is coming upon us so rapidly. I strongly predict

Recording: (2071/ 10721) 
 Well, I always look back and look at this. There were how many thousands, maybe millions of years before Christ. And here we are 2,000 years after Christ. What makes us think  think we aren't going to live to 10, 15, 20, 50,000 years beyond. I can't believe unless there's something like us, our planet,  colliding with another planet or something that would destroy everything. 

Recording: (2072/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2073/ 10721) 
好 

Recording: (2074/ 10721) 
 I mean it has worked and we are ahead of the world. There's no question about that in what the individual people, persons have and how they're like.  On the other hand, you know, I'm actually what I would like for the people who are in  if it would just spread all over the world true communism. 

Recording: (2075/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2076/ 10721) 
 such an idea and that indeed is going to take away from family. In my way of thinking, I can't imagine  that I would have my wife producing somebody else's child over here and I'm going to have the  same thank you that's exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward war

 Raised to love and

 No. 

Recording: (2079/ 10721) 
 No, because all the kids take that California Achievement Test. I don't know if you're familiar with that. Say you and I go to school. You go to Dublin, and I go to the worst  school in Columbus and we both make straight A's. Well, when you take the California Achievement Test, the A's mean nothing because it's like, let's see what you understand and  have learned. The score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those. Because you know they always pick on Columbus Public Schools 

Recording: (2080/ 10721) 
 Well, I think that, my opinion is that if you ain't going to school and you're not going, you're not working and everything, you should be doing something besides causing problems, you know.  And a lot of kids, that's all they really want to do nowadays is just cause aggravation to people. 

Recording: (2081/ 10721) 
 and putting the street lights they have at Easton. 

Recording: (2082/ 10721) 
 the people of this land had a way of worshiping God and that's the way I follow. So a lot of people say that's Native American and  or say that's Indian or whatever, I don't care what they want to put on it, but it's a natural way of following God is the way I put it.  that respecting the spirit that moves through all things, all living things. And so I went through 

Recording: (2083/ 10721) 
 And... 

Recording: (2084/ 10721) 
 Not really at parties. Parties are usually just mostly kegs. Sometimes there's pots, sometimes there's not.

 but it's inevitable.

 nothing about this planet. 

Recording: (2087/ 10721) 
 Not so much. For 15 years I lived down on which is more a lot of artists live there but I'm amazed that my new street  is full of artists too.

 Yeah.

But then here comes Cooper's wife and his daughter and like his  I'm thinking, they're putting all his family up in this hotel the night before a game? I don't know, I just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when  none of those boys get to bring anybody, you know what I mean? 

Recording: (2090/ 10721) 
 Now that's the Pokemon.  Pokemon characters but couldn't tell you his phone number. And that's true with mine. 

Recording: (2091/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2092/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'm opposed to parental consent. But I don't have kids, so that opinion doesn't mean as much as it might from someone who did. 

Recording: (2093/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (2094/ 10721) 
 Was it, was, they actually had a law or they, or it was a referendum?

 Netstock basically goes out to Yahoo and checks to see what the stock prices on something are. And so I made Netstock, IIS, and IndexServer.  all play nicely together today.

 Right.

 You probably know more than I do than Randy. I never went there with him because my dad's very against it. He's Episcopalian.  Tchau.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2099/ 10721) 
 you know when she's in her middle years and Tamara when she's you know but you know I finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing is the one  thing in life we get to do where there's no restrictions, no laws, nobody gives you any limitations or parameters. They just say go for it and people just go nuts  with it. 

Recording: (2100/ 10721) 
 One of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it and they had bugged me about it forever to come and like I don't know about computers  So they took me finally like December or something. 

Recording: (2101/ 10721) 
 I was just, it's just wow, this is, this has blown my mind. So I said, okay, Spanish looks good. So it's just a degree.  so I can just get out and go and travel. Like I say, a lot of these companies, a lot of these, like you say, well, you know, I don't know what the requirements are for some of these jobs over in Europe, but say.  Maybe it's like as long as you have any sort of like degree, you know, they'll take you. Clerical, whatever.  So why did you decide to go to Ohio State? 

Recording: (2102/ 10721) 
 They don't have nothing like that nowadays. Somebody fall through the ice and they'd sue them. 

Recording: (2103/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm Yeah, I You know, I said, I don't know. I just I got to make some decisions here, you know, I don't want to put  put too much pressure on it. You know, one of the elders told me, hey, you know, cut yourself some slack and just relax for a while. You know, because I worked at a movie theater  for a year and you know I got hassled about my hair you know told me the only thing

 He's at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go, everybody's going to put all their work on computer.

 Um, no, actually now I live in Hilliard.

 Oh.

 They've been just troubled kids in the past I have 

Recording: (2108/ 10721) 
 Basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood. 

Recording: (2109/ 10721) 
 because the problem with guns in my opinion is you don't have to think to use it. It takes, you know, you don't have to sit there and load it and in a split second  I think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason. You know, just stupidity or whatnot. Just in a split second.  you know we might have that once in a life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can't go oh you know 

Recording: (2110/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2111/ 10721) 
 or somebody or later they'll claim that I was coerced to saying that as I walked out the door. You know, and it's a big lie. 

Recording: (2112/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I haven't, I really haven't even, haven't even given it that much thought yet.

 She couldn't understand, accept the fact that you could just disagree with her. It had to be because she was black or she was an older woman.  You couldn't just disagree. Had to be a reason there.  Fortunately, she accused me of that in front of my boss, who was black, who didn't believe it. He knew better. 

Recording: (2115/ 10721) 
 Oh my goodness.

 I do know a few people that are gay, but they're in their 30s. 

Recording: (2117/ 10721) 
 Well, basically it's the same thing here. But some of your management is real good. I've seen people that are super, but I've seen people that are bad. The problem is you get a bad management.  And it can make your life hell. I don't care who you are. 

Recording: (2118/ 10721) 
 What else? 

Recording: (2119/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's kind of subjective, although there is a paper that we hand out to our kids that tells exactly what's supposed to be in every part of this essay.  The first, the introductory paragraph is supposed to consist of a way to capture the reader's attention, it's supposed to supply background information, it's supposed to stay  state your thesis statement, which tells mainly what the paper is going to be about, and then you're supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas about your thesis

 Isn't that fun?

 Hahaha 

Recording: (2126/ 10721) 
 you

 I had fun, I enjoyed it. It's one of my favorite classes actually, for an elective. 

Recording: (2128/ 10721) 
 It's beautiful and we like going to see the ski resorts and everything. I don't really ski. 

Recording: (2129/ 10721) 
 You can see with the housing trends. And there again, it goes back to the stupid consumer. I say stupid consumer because when I was in college, I always said, well, the consumer had a fourth grade education level. 

Recording: (2130/ 10721) 
 No children, so it was quite easy for us. 

Recording: (2131/ 10721) 
 They can't fathom that. 

Recording: (2132/ 10721) 
 I'm

 Well, as far as the racism issue, first, they showed some figures on the news and actually it was like more

 So once you convince people that there's nothing to be scared of here, and there's nothing to be scared of there, then they start to play. And once you start playing, you start learning. 

Recording: (2135/ 10721) 
 or I would say 99, 98%. 

Recording: (2136/ 10721) 
 Okay, well I'm not really from Columbus either. I've been here for a little over a year now. My husband went to high school here and had a daughter while he was in  high school so after he finished college he wanted to relocate here and we kind of lived between Worthington and Westerville kind of north  Columbus and I like it a lot 

Recording: (2137/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I really don't know. I don't understand why they don't because to me it's the most important freedom we have and people bitch and complain  all the time, but then when you ask them if they voted, they go, no, it makes no difference. Well, it makes no difference if you don't because your voice wasn't heard. When I was a political  consultant for the Ohio Education Association. I used to go around and try to get teachers involved in politics. And one of the things I would tell them is that every vote is important. John Kennedy won  you 

Recording: (2138/ 10721) 
 Well, believe me, I know. 

Recording: (2139/ 10721) 
 like Catholic, oh, for Mormons? Well, our basic, real fundamental belief is that the church that the Russians believed in  one time was the true church and that it was the same church that Christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve apostles and  But after Christ died, the authority was taken from the earth to

 Heh. 

Recording: (2143/ 10721) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (2144/ 10721) 
 so they couldn't go in that direction. They'd have to just bring in new people, which I think probably wouldn't be a good idea. 

Recording: (2145/ 10721) 
 listen to music. 

Recording: (2146/ 10721) 
 Nope, not my area. Not my area. If it's hot in here.

 But now he's with that girl he was cheating on with. He's with her now. They live together. So he's like going through a pattern too. And I he's a very they're like the real nice people.  It's just they just, I feel like they don't, and I try to tell them, don't mess up again. I just like, grow up, grow up.

 Lassie.  And programs like that, they were good down home programs that taught good values to the children. But now they put some of those stupid, I can't even understand,  I don't understand them. Some of the comedies they have on with these funny characters and everything else, they don't look like anybody we see walking around this earth. Why do they have them on there?  I

 That's because their parents are rich.

 Everybody's code. 

Recording: (2155/ 10721) 
 if you just said take or get, I just, I say well, I'm just going to, because when you get out in the work world, there's going to be two  things they care about about your writing? Is it usable and is it persuasive? Because usually when you're writing something in the workplace it's either to explain  something or it's to persuade somebody to do something. So if it's not those two things, it's not writing that's going to make it in the

 and that's where the Ohio State players, I don't know if you know this, they stay there every night before a game. I mean it's the most expensive hotel in Columbus. All the players stay there but  To my amazement, they come down for a dinner, then they come down for a midnight snack. It's so funny how these guys come down in their shorts and stuff.

Recording: (2163/ 10721) 
 they go, oh, look how bad their test scores. Well, if you take, say, the worst school in town, which I don't know what it would be, but let's just say it's Brown School.  You have children there who have not seen dad in probably 10 years, and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison, so they live with grandma.  How do you expect them to do well? Nobody's there to, you know, I'm not a, you know, an ogre or anything, but, you know, I always keep tabs on my kids, you know, like I've always gone to

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2167/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, he does back down too often, I think. Well, the health insurance didn't have a chance.  I mean, no matter what position he took on the health insurance, trying to radically change things, it wasn't going to get through Congress. And so yeah, he backed down, but I would have liked to have seen it.  seen something else happen to it. But it was also, I mean he gave up because it was useless to fight it. I didn't think it was going to get through Congress.

 you 

Recording: (2184/ 10721) 
 Does that make sense? 

Recording: (2185/ 10721) 
 better to give and I sometimes try to weigh that if that's part of why. I can't believe it's an attention  getter because there's nothing to be gained by getting attention for the work you do.  just within, maybe one feels. And I think it's a matter of being conscientious too. 

Recording: (2186/ 10721) 
 No. 

Recording: (2187/ 10721) 
 This is in the summer now, we go down to Old Tangier River to go fishing. Over there where Doddridge is, there used to be a bass recreation center with a miniature golf course and everything.

 I mean, Colin Powell was pretty close, if he would have ran.

 And how many dollars does a consumer put into research as opposed to the business? That's the inequity in our life. And you're basically putting a shaft to the consumer.

 And if you don't do well, you go, but I like doing it and I'm going to keep with it. And to me, the straight A student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people.  nothing in their life at all.

 When I did school levy campaigns and a couple of other campaigns, to me the biggest thing is what the campaign does on election day called Get Out the Vote.  That's the most important thing that can be done.

 But I don't think that it goes into values. I don't associate rise in crime or something with  like crime on TV or something. I mean, if there is a correlation, I mean, I'm more of the, you know, like...  Parents have a greater influence on the children than TV ever could.

 So there was a big fuss about that. And two years later they came out with another study that says, well, they need to refurbish or not. Some schools closed a couple, and then knocked some down and rebuilt them.  And it's like every two years it's a different direction. It's like they're almost afraid to take a stand that somebody's not going to like. Well, if you're going to shut a school down, somebody's going to be really ticked off.

 So that's a huge amount of money that they put into it. And what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra.  So sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra, especially string players because they don't have a college orchestra. But once in a while we'll have a student play.  get wind players play in it also. And sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something 

Recording: (2231/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. I don't see, figure that out. I think it's all fixed.

 Wow.

 the opportunity to serve one another and that's the downfall of our society because we're thinking more of ourselves instead of others. And I think as we've  become older you start thinking about how much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith. It's not  not the materialistic things that the university here professes to be the thing.

 All I remember is them talking about condoms. I don't think they talked about anything besides that.  Then again, I could be remembering wrong. But yes, that, I mean, it is the stance, but I think in the schools,  I mean that's sort of like the hard line at the Catholic Church, but in the more progressive schools they're a little bit more realistic.

 I really think civil rights have gone too far. Because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person,  There's another rule that says that's okay if that other person does it to you. I mean, my mother used to say for every law that was written, there's another law written over here that will actually nullify that one.  And actually as I have grown older I found it's worse in today's world as I said as the silver rights move it and you have a right to this and you have a right to that.

When I was going to school, I didn't know any. And I went to OU, and honestly, down there, I didn't know anybody that was gay.

 My thing is you try to do your best on earth, do the attributes you have. Whether it's supposed to be a missionary, fine. Can you see a missionary working in the office? There's needs  for missionary work in the offices around us on the campus every day. You're talking about diversity here? All you got to do is just sit down. You know, it's not a numbers game.  It's not a number scheme at all. Just learn about one another and you're going to find out. You know what? I think they said the colorblind society. That's what we got to do.

 groups and different cliques, but I can't help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that, that  It had to have been more than just normal jocks versus whatever.  So I think it should be more, I don't know, I mean even, you know, I went to a private 

Recording: (2369/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2370/ 10721) 
 No, because I think there's the ideal in everything and if you can't live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do  do. And I think that's where I was coming from. I mean, even now, I mean I could never  agree with abortion, let's say, I would stand by the church. And most of the church laws I do stand by. But I guess the 

Recording: (2371/ 10721) 
 Yeah, unfortunately. Well, some people have to. I mean, you know, the police officers and whatnot, they are required to carry a gun, but almost every kid  I know that has had a gun even if they keep a gun hidden here and the bullets hidden over here

 less fortunate out there and that there's little things we can do.

 Where are you from?

 seductively looking at the camera and you're like okay how many different bras do women really need? That is not for the women I'm sorry. Most women  women by the time they're buying bras know what choices they have. You don't need all that. But then it's funny because then I keep flipping through and I look at the men. The men's heads are usually kind of  They're not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all. I mean, it's just so unequal. So we leave these guys or these poor boys that are 

Recording: (2375/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2376/ 10721) 
 Well, that's competition to be earliest and the federal government is trying to stay out of the state's face. So again, that's another one of those  things that just live with it. I mean there's enough there's enough things to do and fight in life that that's not worth it. 

Recording: (2377/ 10721) 
 so the state would pay for it.

 about 13 years, I think. My dad, once he got through with his residency and everything, we moved to Mansfield and he joined  to practice and we've been living there ever since. Mansfield's about I'd say 55, 60,000 people.  and Ashland is probably about 25 to 30,000 people. But Mansfield is 

Recording: (2380/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it is. But see, I've always, I have one floors where I live now, I vacuum them. I mean, I'm just the type, you know, I didn't want pet hair and

 No, I haven't.

 Definitely. Definitely. 

Recording: (2383/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2384/ 10721) 
 Let's put it this way, when I was a kid, you didn't want to be brought home by the police. You were actually scared of the police. Nowadays, what's a kid scared of? Nothing. 

Recording: (2385/ 10721) 
 Well, we had a Diamond Jubilee at the village and Coleman and Teter both came and they both, I thought it was in some ways kind of a close race.  I didn't think that there was that much difference in them ideologically. I think she would do just about the same as he is. He might be a little bit better.  But in terms of having a black mayor, I think that's good for Columbus.

 play with him, take him in on the kitchen floor so he can roam around because our kitchen is like open. 

Recording: (2387/ 10721) 
 and tried to get my family in it with some success, not as much as I'd like.  But I think they're all responsible, well-adjusted people and have families of their own. I have nine grandkids.  grandchildren, one great-grandson, and the boys were all on the sheet metal trade also. 

Recording: (2388/ 10721) 
 want them. And I'm like, what? He says, we look at two children sitting side by side. This one's making straight A's. This one's sort of made B's.  But this one over here got into track when he or she was in freshman's and we noticed every track meet they basically were like last or second to last.  but they did it for four years. Then they... 

Recording: (2389/ 10721) 
 So it's an adjustment to get back into it, but I do like it up there better.  as far as possibilities of working closer to home and stuff and not have to worry about a bus and 

Recording: (2390/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2391/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm, it's real well-known. 

Recording: (2392/ 10721) 
 And she said she'd get back to me on it. Well, I've never heard nothing from her. And she's done that to me I don't know how many times. 

Recording: (2393/ 10721) 
 I think so. I mean, there's enough open-minded people in the country.

 wall that sacred heat wall 

Recording: (2395/ 10721) 
 It's hard. 

Recording: (2396/ 10721) 
 things get away from it all yeah yeah so I came down here because he knew where my parents lived in plus Columbus was a lot more opportunity 

Recording: (2397/ 10721) 
 until I threatened to sue them. 

Recording: (2398/ 10721) 
 Do you really? Somebody says you could like walk up there's like some sort of staircase and you can actually walk up to her head if you really if you really want to go up and walk up to her head you can do that. 

Recording: (2399/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and since it's not sponsored officially by the university, they can do whatever they want. And they don't have any.  possibility of, I'm looking for a word here, repercussions. 

Recording: (2400/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2401/ 10721) 
 right well here's here's a can of man which it's a dollar fifty and we'll give you fifty cents off well gee if I just use the recipe on the microwave cookbook I can make it home for like three cents  But you know why? It's convenience. I can throw it in the microwave and it'll be done in five minutes. You know, like mashed potatoes in a microwave or, you know, it's like, hello, it's, you know.  I can understand how people do it because they come home from work and it's like I don't want to be a cook I don't want to be a cleanup. So I'll pay somebody to do this pay somebody that and pretty 

Recording: (2402/ 10721) 
 It took me about six months and then I finally decided that I really liked it and it was what I had been wanting.  So that's how I decided. 

Recording: (2403/ 10721) 
 Really? 

Recording: (2404/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2405/ 10721) 
 great

 Of course, they don't believe in the unions now like they used to.

 15 years old, they look like they're 20-some years old, you know, and that's what they want to look like. Plus you watch some of these stupid shows on TV, you know, and you sit there and go.  Man, I couldn't, my daughter don't do that, you know, when she's around me. Now, when she's away from me, I don't know what the hell she does.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2422/ 10721) 
 Isn't that amazing? 

Recording: (2423/ 10721) 
 There's like two people who are like from the, I mean they're not old, but they're like from the 40s and they have bought generators, they bought water, they've got extra food.  They've got a freeze extra freezers. They bought ammunition. It's like hello, you know, I just think it's 

Recording: (2424/ 10721) 
 need 

Recording: (2425/ 10721) 
 I think for the most part people can handle it. Obviously I think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would  have the bigger problem with it. The ones that grew up during the whole black rights movements and things like that. I could see them having a problem with it but I mean more like  like 

Recording: (2426/ 10721) 
 I don't think so. 

Recording: (2427/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2428/ 10721) 
 It's like an advertisement for it. 

Recording: (2429/ 10721) 
 How long have you been here? 

Recording: (2430/ 10721) 
 I had the same thing happen to my kid. I smacked him one time. 

Recording: (2431/ 10721) 
 And that's so sad for our city. 

Recording: (2432/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and this is something I've thought about a lot because if I had stayed in Cincinnati, say, where it's very conservative, you know, not real open to new things, or if I had stayed  on the East Coast where of course it would be really competitive. I probably wouldn't be working as a freelancer today. I came to Columbus, there wasn't much going on when I came here. 

Recording: (2433/ 10721) 
 you know, a check magnet. 

Recording: (2434/ 10721)

 So they built one out in Hilliard.

 I need a grocery list to find out what we need to buy.

 Maybe, because she says us Americans are different.

 It's better in terms of the yards.

 Oh, that's great.

 there. 

Recording: (2446/ 10721) 
 Emma's sort of a timeless name in that it's been around for a long time, yet people don't associate it with old women.  because there are still Emmas today.

 through children's services and they gave me custody of the child temporarily and she still  there and she's four and a half. The mother's married and has another child now and the little one's still with me.

 oh yeah yes what religion are you all that one has all those me these gurus work out real life christianity yeah  I'm so sorry. 

Recording: (2449/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's hard because I'm a Christian, so I believe that homosexuality is wrong,  I don't like I said I'm not going to condemn them at all like I said I have friends. I understand what you're saying but I think that's  something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out. Maybe that child is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort. 

Recording: (2450/ 10721) 
 And she's very determined. She has said that being pregnant and having this baby has made her focus on things a lot differently.  She doesn't want to go back to being the way she was before. She doesn't want to go back to the drugs and the smoking and the drinking. 

Recording: (2451/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2452/ 10721) 
 There was an in-depth story about that, I think it was Harper's Magazine or what, it was in a significant magazine where they had made a study of  the New York situation and I found that quite interesting and very, very impressive. As a matter of fact, what a remarkable thing to see.  I remember sending it in to the city council of Dayton. I just addressed it as a matter of fact. 

Recording: (2453/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (2454/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2455/ 10721) 
 If you don't make a child support payment, they should do the same thing. I don't know why they don't have a system like that. 

Recording: (2456/ 10721) 
 I'm not real up on everything that's been done, but I guess it just kind of seems like I wish people would be a little bit more focused and you would be able to say, you know, this is what there's  These three things that I think are really important that I'm really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of. And I just think people kind of la-dee-dah and say, well, it's like this.  we'll see what we can kind of do about it and then we'll, you know. 

Recording: (2457/ 10721) 
 everything and I come back and you know where my parents live there were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and I just felt like I was in you know this like giant cave  Hey Martland, you know, I mean it just was so overwhelming even though obviously I'd grown up with in America my whole life and you know not that I sort of  changed completely, but you do when you've been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to Easton and I 

Recording: (2458/ 10721) 
 and his parents can pick him up. And everybody was annoyed. My husband said, I would have let her stay. I don't understand why you're doing this. I don't care. I want her to come home. The other, well, the bottom line was  hysterical because she and this little boy, they're outside, he's jumping on the trampoline, I go up to him and I introduce myself and I say, you know, honey, I said, really sorry about the plans, but I just, you can, I  I just could not let her stay there that long. He goes, oh that's okay, my mom would never let me do that. So I'm thinking, here's how everybody's acting like I'm the bad guy. 

Recording: (2459/ 10721) 
 Yeah, like I knew Like a lot of people who lived on campus. I used to live down on Hudson like over the summer before I went to OSU  So, I mean I like campus and everything it's just like oh she was different than campus, yeah

 to the most part yeah i mean obviously i can see the camera catholic church was against it but at the same time like research things like that where  saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where I mean they couldn't can't so much really condemn it to the point anymore that they used to.

 Actually, I wore out.

 One day, it was a really bad day. I'd gone to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and came back. I hadn't had anything to eat the entire day.  It was like midnight and I got home and I thought I'm too tired and hungry and I'm not making anything so I just went to bed.  A guy knocked on my door, which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me, and he'd tell me, are you in there? And I wouldn't answer. Well, it was a real cheap apartment. He took a credit card and punched the. 

Recording: (2467/ 10721)

 Hello. 

Recording: (2472/ 10721) 
 That's true. Sometimes we have trouble finding enough violists or something, you know, an instrument like that.  But they usually get enough to play a concert. Sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for less  few rehearsals. So we sort of have stringers, I guess you'd call them. Yeah, we've actually

 I had to pack it up.

And about how they just continue to get raises and they're not doing very much about it and less than 50% of  the police force is actually in police cars and a lot of people are doing desk jobs and those types of things. And I guess a lot of people just aren't very happy with the job he's been doing.

 How many people want that?

 Yeah, well like, I mean high school has always been really easy and like high school was really easy, like I never really felt like challenged even remotely by anything.  is  So college was a little bit different. I mean, it was like a little bit more challenging. I mean, it's basically the same thing in high school. You just have less time to do the material, you know? So it's just like, as opposed to having three weeks to do a paper and

 Yeah. Yeah.

 You lose sight of that, I think. You know what I mean? And a lot of those guys become real egotistical. I mean, I like my uncle and everything, but... 

Recording: (2493/ 10721) 
 Doesn't that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me, me, me now and therefore they really don't so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are?

 No, it's kind of like you go to a private school and you get there maybe seven years old on up to 15, 16.

 Pretty good, he liked it a lot, but it was a big change from the Catholic school. Big change. He liked it a lot. I don't know if you're familiar with Fort Hayes.  It's a college prep, they call it an alternative school, it's called Magnet School in most places. It's college prep.  with an emphasis on the arts and there's some career programs there. So it was good for him.

 We had, my husband and I had just some herbs, you know, parsley and chives and some basil, rosemary.  type of thing.

Recording: (2514/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly. 

Recording: (2515/ 10721) 
 I think people are still fairly racist. I don't think it's near as bad as it was. But at the same time, I mean I can't say I blame  the white community so much for it. I would say it's probably both the white and I guess any other race relations fault.  I mean as far as like if you look at the black community and things like that you have like BET, you have like the United Negro College Fund, things like that. 

Recording: (2516/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, I would have to work shift work. Yeah, so. 

Recording: (2517/ 10721) 
 Those were the two worst. 

Recording: (2518/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (2519/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's going to have to be from the bottom up, I think. And everybody keeps, and I'm just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything. They're coming with 2000 on it.  I'm hoping people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it. But I'm hoping that it does mean  since people are so focused on it, does mean a shift in consciousness, I hope. Y2K, I don't know what that really stands for.  I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (2520/ 10721) 
 No, not really. All my good friends from, well, I'd say like out of all my good friends from high school, one of them, no, two of them are still here.

 you  13-year-old boy who was interviewed was saying, oh, you know, he had slept with like 10 girls or something. And I'm thinking, oh my gosh, you know, and he's 13.  and had a few kids and that was it. But in my opinion, the main problem there is 

Recording: (2524/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2525/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I was really glad that my son, you know, was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because, you know, the guys are real  real nice. He's always been real standoffish when it comes to

 So it's still just sitting down on my computer sits next to it. The only thing is you take it down, you can only have half a desk. 

Recording: (2530/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 Oh. 

Recording: (2532/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2533/ 10721) 
 Now that doesn't make any extra work for the teacher, but it gives him a shot. He usually will answer the concepts. He'll usually answer the  main stuff that he knows, and if you only grade him on that, he might have a shot at a C or a B. I mean, there's all kinds of ways to modify, give a  reduced work amount, give a kid a copy of another student's notes if his are crummy and he can't study from them. We even have a thing at our school that it's 

Recording: (2534/ 10721) 
 I think because of the movies and I think of Nintendo and all those games that they have on there, I think that really does spark things in little children.  children's minds and even like in junior high, oh yeah we could do that. There's just so much violence when we were growing up, there wasn't any violence.  on TV, we were allowed to watch it. But you know what I mean, the comics weren't violent. Now it's too open for kids. The parents, they see the parents from 

Recording: (2535/ 10721) 
 you know you can do anything for $50 a week you know you can work two hours a day you know for a week and $50 for two kids is really not that bad.  that much a week so 

Recording: (2536/ 10721) 
 stuff done. I don't know if it's just because you have to get agreement from everybody else in government before you can pass anything.  Why don't these things get taken care of? There are so many different issues that people want to look at and you end up focusing on things like Philip Morris, which is the biggest thing in the whole world.  There are so many other things that I think you could be looking at that are important. 

Recording: (2537/ 10721) 
 Oh 

Recording: (2538/ 10721) 
 He left her there and they said they called me but I was around the sweeper so I didn't hear the phone. So left her there and he said that she was going to call back at a certain time and I was going to tell her what she  could have done.  down, picked him up, and I said, let the kid come to our house. He can come here until 11. 

Recording: (2539/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they won't bother it. 

Recording: (2540/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's been like that every year, basically. 

Recording: (2541/ 10721) 
 So that's just the sheer numbers of it, I think. 

Recording: (2542/ 10721) 
 you know, and these schools that have a thousand people, I just can't imagine. I mean, you know, my high school was like 400 people and we thought that was big at the time. And just to have a  thousand people, excuse me, people, and just to try to monitor different things. I mean, it's got to be so hard, you know, and checking everything and 

Recording: (2543/ 10721) 
 It is implicit thing is to like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and I wanted an old house it was built like 1917 I wanted an old house that had  hadn't been capped up. 

Recording: (2544/ 10721) 
 I have one daughter, 36 years old. She lives in Toledo and then I have two grandchildren. 

Recording: (2545/ 10721) 
 Nope. 

Recording: (2546/ 10721) 
 Generally, it's in the summertime. That's the way it was when she was going to school. Now, you know, with her going to school, like at St. Louis.  I guess it'll be that way 

Recording: (2547/ 10721) 
 Definitely, so my daughter definitely, because she was working for Camp Scruxavit Christ. And she came home one weekend from Oxford and 

Recording: (2548/ 10721) 
 and I did have a very serious relationship in Florida. He was quite a bit younger than I was and I knew he wanted children and I never wanted children unfortunately. I love animals  and things but I just decided I never wanted children and I knew he eventually would so I was engaged to him but I decided to 

Recording: (2549/ 10721) 
 It's been remarkably well. I mean I haven't had any problems. I found out pretty early, which was kind of strange at about four weeks, and I went in and I  had a checkup and my doctor thought I was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound. Well the thing is they did this ultrasound and they didn't find anything. So which was really kind of creepy because they didn't know because  There's that whole tubal pregnancy thing and all this stuff. And the guy that did my ultrasound wasn't my regular doctor. And he's kind of, well, he's just a little. 

Recording: (2550/ 10721) 
 I think my daughter Jennifer is very active, not so much the type of work that I do, but I think she's very charitable, very  giving, very

 Yeah, I mean, I can't say that there'd be any difference with them.

Recording: (2553/ 10721) 
 Yeah

 because I've seen things that are not physically possible. 

Recording: (2555/ 10721) 
 Bad acoustics, really. 

Recording: (2556/ 10721) 
 Well yeah, we got broke into I think twice and stuff got stolen. My truck's been broken into, my mom's car's been broken into.  the gas siphon. Pretty much everybody around there has been criminalized one way or another. 

Recording: (2557/ 10721) 
 So the money's just kind of wasted. 

Recording: (2558/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2559/ 10721) 
 Well, when I was growing up, there wasn't that much violence. And I could go in the end, and I have done it. My name ain't on this report, so you can't do nothing about it. 

Recording: (2560/ 10721) 
 But they don't use umbrellas. I mean, they just go through it. They're just so used to it. And they wear that kind of jacket, you know, because it's not a hard rain. And the first year I was  there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there's no cold real cold winter and and then from July, August  September and October is just gorgeous. Just so gorgeous. But I like that fog and that mist and 

Recording: (2561/ 10721) 
 a real slap in the face for him. So he was really mean after that. So I left. I just walked out. I picked the kids up at the bus stop and they're like, Mommy, what are you doing?  I said we're going somewhere, let's get in the car. So, but yeah, just a couple experiences like that that will make you do other things.  You know, I stayed tough and I, you know, got other jobs and 

Recording: (2562/ 10721) 
 But it's mind boggling that it's, because I came from a small community, there were only 200 people in my senior class and you knew everybody. And now you're talking two whole high schools  two football teams, it's just mind boggling, all these people. You graduate with no handful of people and don't know anybody else.  you know, a lot more of a tight-knit group as a child. We had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it. 

Recording: (2563/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (2564/ 10721) 
 I think that's certainly possible. There are lots of ways that my brain doesn't work in ways that other people's do. So I think a lot of it too has to do with  being comfortable with yourself and knowing, you know, I mean, I've gotten so much better over the years. I was very, I've always been real, a lot more temperamental.  We always joke that predictable and some of those things are not even temperate or not things you would use to describe me.

I agree in Deep Space Nine, I'm a big Deep Space Nine fan, I don't dislike Voyager, I just don't like it to the same degree.

 No. 

Recording: (2575/ 10721) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (2576/ 10721) 
 What they should do is just tell people that their kids don't get to go to school. I bet the attitude changes pretty fast. 

Recording: (2577/ 10721) 
 And they're not the kind that would go out and just shoot an animal. They would use it for food. I know one time that they gave it to a family that was  didn't have any money and didn't have any food, they wouldn't kill some animals and gave it to them. I don't have a problem with that.  My brother-in-law is very much opposed to any kind of gun control. He believes whatever Charlton Heston tells him.

 Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, and you know, that song by itself, probably if I just heard it once or twice, it's okay. Yeah. And she's an interesting character.  I guess I mean, I don't know everything about her, but I I remember that she insulted the Pope Yeah

 and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack on the bottom.  with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be. I know the most effective penalty for me was my mother.  would go out near a tree and she would break a twig off and she would smack me across the shoulder.

Recording: (2586/ 10721) 
 Right. I think teaching band might be fun because I think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there.  Whether you were well behaved, yeah, and whether you're trying to play your instrument. I don't think we ever got A's, B's, and C's.  Yeah.

 Yeah, right. 

Recording: (2588/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 because it's more open and you count it in terms of civil rights. My boyfriend thinks it's wrong morally.  but doesn't think we ought to be discriminating against. He thinks it's a sin. Therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through, you know, talking to people.  talking to them religion-wise. I don't think it's a sin. I think that your sexuality is genetic-based. 

Recording: (2590/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2591/ 10721) 
 then I 

Recording: (2592/ 10721) 
 Yes, too, but that has primarily because of necessity, more often than not. Maybe even today it's less  than that because it's been because of a loss of a parent or inability of a parent or parents being able to handle those children.  So yes, those things do exist and they will always have some, but that's a very small percentage though, Scott.

 And they're very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them. 

Recording: (2597/ 10721) 
 You start thinking a little differently. And I think as you talk, you should be talking to some older people. I'm seeing people in the in their 80s. To find out how the progression of life is  is and how you think because when you go to estate sales all you're talking about this profit motive they're sitting on the lawns  The quality of life is in the mind of the person. You avoid it all the time. 

Recording: (2598/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but you just have to have something to go by and this is a close thing and we have to just go with it, you know, I mean you can't go back and try to read. I don't know, somebody was trying to rearrange the calendar one time, weren't they?

 argue about this but I'm sorry if God did not mean that I can conceive and have my own child why should I try to implant somebody else's inside of me and produce it I mean I would rather go out and see this other child  that really needs help and adopt that baby. Because you can see them and you can help them and you're already aware to a certain extent of what genes they might  inherited and what problems you might be getting. Sometimes you don't. Later on you'll find out. But still you can go back and you can find the parent.

They've also done other things, other, they do  anything dealing with the environment like exposure, things like that.

 that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that, yeah, there's a lot there. There's way too much shared experience to gloss over effectively.

Recording: (2638/ 10721) 
 People like that can't work. When I was a kid, your family took care of you. There wasn't welfare and stuff like this. But you don't have a family structure no more. 

Recording: (2639/ 10721) 
 my background. 

Recording: (2640/ 10721) 
 My wife and I had four children, three boys and a daughter. My sons all live here in Columbus.  out in Seattle in the Redmond area. I've been active in church  work, Sunday school all my life. 

Recording: (2641/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (2642/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'm a Democrat. I've never voted for a Republican in my life, even when I lived in Oregon and I always adored Mark Hatfield. I didn't vote for him.  I was out there with him, we're insane, because I thought he was a great Republican.  But I think personally Mike Coleman was good. I've met well 

Recording: (2643/ 10721) 
 you know, when he can wrestle with them and all that. Right now he's just, he sits there and when he cries he goes, what does he want? Like I know, go down the list, hon.  change his diaper, if he, it's been three hours since he's had a bottle, give him a bottle, you know. 

Recording: (2644/ 10721) 
 Oh it has you know your basic Lazarus which I like to go to Lazarus and Sears and JC Penney's and no I wouldn't want to drive  to Polaris to go to those stores, but if they made some outlets over there, you know, I'd be happy with that. There's just a lot of small  smaller stores, you know, like Victoria's Secrets and bookstores and toy stores and athletic wear stores.  you 

Recording: (2645/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2646/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2647/ 10721) 
 And a damn thing they're scared of when I we were kids we used to make zip guns We take an ink pen take the pen piece out put a firecracker in 

Recording: (2648/ 10721) 
 And... 

Recording: (2649/ 10721) 
 Did you really? 

Recording: (2650/ 10721) 
 Like, yeah, like 500 people in a lecture hall, yeah. 

Recording: (2651/ 10721) 
 Okay, no, I haven't been following it really. 

Recording: (2652/ 10721) 
 Now I think that those four kids, at least among my grandchildren, are getting pretty much at the same training that I did, or maybe better than I did.  My oldest son's two daughters are—I don't know if they're still alive.  Well, they're good kids and they're smart kids, but I don't think that they have the moral grounding  that 

Recording: (2653/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (2654/ 10721) 
 somewhat. 

Recording: (2655/ 10721) 
 She is, she's adorable. How old is she in this picture? 

Recording: (2656/ 10721) 
 I mean, I'm sure there is some, but it's not as extreme as some places that I've been. 

Recording: (2657/ 10721) 
 It's just like the people you see go to church. I walk out of church and see somebody sitting there that's homeless. 

Recording: (2658/ 10721) 
 Well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the end. Most people get ahead of themselves. 

Recording: (2659/ 10721) 
 Or do you want to run over me? Is that what you want to do? 

Recording: (2660/ 10721) 
 Right in there, yeah. And I had friends that lived in Buckhead. 

Recording: (2661/ 10721) 
 nation because of their actual sitting down and hands on critiquing these children. Like,  friend of mine. She was pretty much, I wouldn't put her borderline illiterate, but she didn't know how to read or write. 

Recording: (2662/ 10721) 
 They're like, oh, they are like the people in Crocodile Dundee, but they're just, no, they're just like. 

Recording: (2663/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2664/ 10721) 
 Eastern religions and I've listened to the Jehovah's Witnesses and then when I read in the Book of Mormon, it's just...  It's a feeling of like, I felt like I had heard it before and it made sense to me. And so that's why.  I really felt at home with this and that's why I decided. 

Recording: (2665/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2666/ 10721) 
 Well, but see, I think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that, you know, you should, sex is something that should be between  people that love each other. And unless you really feel love and really think it is love, then you know, you shouldn't do it. 

Recording: (2667/ 10721) 
 Oh, most of it's horribly liberal. And they always find some way to misrepresent, like Kerwin. 

Recording: (2668/ 10721) 
 Indirectly, yes. 

Recording: (2669/ 10721) 
 This will be something good to get on your tape. And they've got people over there where I work at that they'll give them the days off if their cats are sick. 

Recording: (2670/ 10721) 
 Starting over means putting a new operating system on it. 

Recording: (2671/ 10721) 
 I don't even know what their holidays are. I don't know. 

Recording: (2672/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (2673/ 10721) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (2674/ 10721) 
 Al Gore really doesn't entice me at all. He claims he invented the internet. 

Recording: (2675/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there was no property. 

Recording: (2676/ 10721) 
 I sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun, they'll get a gun. It doesn't matter what they do to try to make it so people can't get their hands on it.  guns, they're basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them. 

Recording: (2677/ 10721) 
 No, he didn't. He didn't. 

Recording: (2678/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2679/ 10721) 
 Prague, Czech Republic, Budapest. 

Recording: (2680/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2681/ 10721) 
 It wasn't at the time, but you live in. 

Recording: (2682/ 10721) 
 I mean, to me, you're supposed to earn your grade. 

Recording: (2683/ 10721) 
 It's a real different thing. I mean, you can understand why it'd be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when, you know, you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on.  He used to always, he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that I wouldn't have to deal with it the whole time. 

Recording: (2684/ 10721) 
 Oh, gosh, that's really going around a lot. 

Recording: (2685/ 10721) 
 He always says. 

Recording: (2686/ 10721) 
 Yeah, my grandmother's from Ireland. My grandmother and grandfather are both from Ireland. 

Recording: (2687/ 10721) 
 Buh- 

Recording: (2688/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they are. 

Recording: (2689/ 10721) 
 I come back and it's just... 

Recording: (2690/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2691/ 10721) 
 Right, at the age that they were. 

Recording: (2692/ 10721) 
 You're right. 

Recording: (2693/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, because they think they're grown. They think they're grown and they're like 12 and 13 and they've been having sex since they were 10.  It's just like, and yeah, and they're having babies earlier and earlier and it's just really scary. 

Recording: (2694/ 10721) 
 But with kids in there, just so much more active at an early age. 

Recording: (2695/ 10721) 
 people that just really want to teach as opposed to like I don't know why other people want to like even went into teaching at all you know but I think that would help just making it more  more like not so impersonal, not so this is, you know, you do this to get this certain grade. It's like you do this to learn this because it's interesting as opposed to like,  And I don't know. I think it's like there's a lot of things that it's more Compulsory education is weird like being forced to 

Recording: (2696/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2697/ 10721) 
 Really? 

Recording: (2698/ 10721) 
 Um, 

Recording: (2699/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2700/ 10721) 
 No, I just think that typically you see a lot of places that are under construction, not very many people working there. 

Recording: (2701/ 10721) 
 Just because you're, I mean, I wasn't really an athletic. I did play sports when I was in high school, but I would dance or wasn't any good, you know, just like other guys.  But whether I did or whether I didn't, you know, I don't know. Nobody picked on me. I mean, one time I got into it with one of the  centers in football, you know, a big old guy. And I was still about the same size. 

Recording: (2702/ 10721) 
 I'm from here, Columbus, Ohio. 

Recording: (2703/ 10721) 
 I do all of our own taxes. I keep thinking I must be doing it wrong because it's not that hard. Everybody acts like all this is such a big deal. 

Recording: (2704/ 10721) 
 Well, I suppose. Well, I decided that I was going to date a black guy and my husband  My dad didn't like that at all. So he disowned me. And so now he I'm married to my husband and 

Recording: (2705/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2706/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2707/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's mainly what happens is you get all the out of town bad stuff. I mean, it just kind of absorbs like a sponge.  challenge. 

Recording: (2708/ 10721) 
 All right. 

Recording: (2709/ 10721) 
 Boring. 

Recording: (2710/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2711/ 10721) 
 And I think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is colored by the fact that I collected data for 20 years from employers.  I'm a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm just a lot more sympathetic to people  collecting data. 

Recording: (2712/ 10721) 
 Damn it. 

Recording: (2713/ 10721) 
 Just getting over there. 

Recording: (2714/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2715/ 10721) 
 She's pretty nice, I mean, she's definitely least standable. 

Recording: (2716/ 10721) 
 Yeah, most of them. 

Recording: (2717/ 10721) 
 I thought this was something like maybe unique to the States. 

Recording: (2718/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2719/ 10721) 
 you  three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like Texas is a fairly big economy, but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy 

Recording: (2720/ 10721) 
 I guess that happened just here in town a couple, about a week ago or something like that, you know, where a guy shot another guy. But, I mean...  Those things are just senseless crimes, really. Who's really to fault? Who's really to... Who's guilty? I don't know.  I'd like to have not today they ever would have but if one of the two that you that Columbine, you know, if they would have survived I'd like to 

Recording: (2721/ 10721) 
 I think the people who have already graduated there, like the doctors and the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation among adults.  just that the kids want to go. It's just thought of as a somewhat party school. 

Recording: (2722/ 10721) 
 Oh definitely, definitely. Well I've never had a dog and I've always wanted one. 

Recording: (2723/ 10721) 
 medication of his own free will. That was his responsibility to take that medicine every day just like it's mine to take mine every day. And when I stopped taking mine, that was my responsibility.  I don't want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there's some law that protects me.  people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or off the influence of medication, in case 

Recording: (2724/ 10721) 
 think we need to protect that. So yes, I think it will, but I don't think it's an issue that if you did overtly and said, you know, support candidate A over candidate B because  protect abortion rights. That's going to divide the country and not keep us together. 

Recording: (2725/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (2726/ 10721) 
 It's 

Recording: (2727/ 10721) 
 You know. 

Recording: (2728/ 10721) 
 We've got a nice big house, a barn, some tractors, no animals. Well, we've got a dog, but it's a farm in the sense that we've got a barn, we've got tractors,  We lease some of the land out to a farmer who actually works in plant stuff.  My dad's a doctor. 

Recording: (2729/ 10721) 
 I think the fact that things like responsibility, maybe a long time ago people stayed  married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of their family. You can be divorced and still take care of your family.  things as far as people getting pregnant and then this person goes off and leaves and you've got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and 

Recording: (2730/ 10721) 
 he admits now that he felt neglected at that period. 

Recording: (2731/ 10721) 
 That flipped me out. 

Recording: (2732/ 10721) 
 and move on, maybe somebody else does and that's the way I'm going to be. And like I said, she can clean up and look like a beauty queen, but she can also look just like  you know just basically you know like she was raking leaves 10 minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect and I just think that's sort of shallow because  Because I look at people who have to have the facelifts, and they have to have the perfect hair, and they have to have the perfect clothes. It's like you're so insecure about the 

Recording: (2733/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well there's too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones. Every one of them is different. 

Recording: (2734/ 10721) 
 But everybody in my family is mechanically inclined. 

Recording: (2735/ 10721) 
 I think so. 

Recording: (2736/ 10721) 
 Um, I, when I was growing up, I had a whole glare of cats. 

Recording: (2737/ 10721) 
 But, and he's limited his meat a little bit more, but with men it's a lot harder. I think, you know, when they're used to meat and potato kind of families.  But Thanksgiving doesn't mean that much to me. The family thing does, but the turkey, I don't cook it very often. My sister, we used to get it. 

Recording: (2738/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2739/ 10721) 
 Legal is better. 

Recording: (2740/ 10721) 
 Who do you think wants to keep you from doing something that will help you? Because people that's land and indigenous tribes all over the world, they don't follow the Bible.  They've done pretty damn good, you know. 

Recording: (2741/ 10721) 
 No, I think we're only friends inside the class. I mean, a lot of them I've known from middle school and following them up and you know, they just all go their different ways.  Like the one girl I was friends with at Willow Park, I mean she was a grade lower than me, but when we'd seen each other in the halls, like, hey, what's up? And we'd talk and, you know.  what's going on and we're doing this after school and that and high school. I didn't know anything. I know she was bad. 

Recording: (2742/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah, that's... 

Recording: (2743/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2744/ 10721) 
 I  do and I tell them, they'll be like, oh I have some things around the house that need to be done. So I'd go there and they'd tell people and 

Recording: (2745/ 10721) 
 we have to pay for the uh... we have a uh... yeah we're paying for it 

Recording: (2746/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I don't think I could vote for a violent president. I could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life. 

Recording: (2747/ 10721) 
 Well, because, you know. 

Recording: (2748/ 10721) 
 Not at that time. 

Recording: (2749/ 10721) 
 you know, do the screening. 

Recording: (2750/ 10721) 
 Yeah, right, if you're lucky. But I mean, there's the person that says that, and then there's the other person that says, well, I sure  I admire what you do and I wouldn't be a teacher for anything in this world. You know, the one that's just in awe of you. 

Recording: (2751/ 10721) 
 now. 

Recording: (2752/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2753/ 10721) 
 You don't realize it. 

Recording: (2754/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2755/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (2756/ 10721) 
 neither side's going to do anything about it. Somebody should have did something about that because then, you know, they would have been doing  doing what they were supposed to do to make him, you know, get in line. And so he knew  Hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, hei, 

Recording: (2757/ 10721) 
 They have the gay pride parade and everything, which is good. They should be able to. 

Recording: (2758/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2759/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2760/ 10721) 
 I mean, most men are dogs, yeah. 

Recording: (2761/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (2762/ 10721) 
 I don't have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you. I just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and I was like, you know, you should get out before you actually fail the class.  It was just unpleasant. I think I was stupid. I think that's what it amounts to. Not that I was not able to pick up the data. I was just...  It's unwise in whether or not it was worthwhile. And I believe that it's horribly worthwhile now. And yet now they're not taking classes. 

Recording: (2763/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (2764/ 10721) 
 See that's the difference. Worthington has a program for them. One of the women that I worked with, she was having so many problems similar to mine.  mine when her son was in Columbus schools and she moved to Westerville and they put him in a class for that and I took care of it.  you 

Recording: (2765/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2766/ 10721) 
 Oh, it's horrible. It was horrible because you watch it and you think, oh my God. 

Recording: (2767/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's what I mean, they go by your age too. 

Recording: (2768/ 10721) 
 just because it's been three weeks now. Not only that, there's something in the deal, like they lose their benefits after two weeks and the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they  mess. 

Recording: (2769/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2770/ 10721) 
 And that's one of the things I also learned through this was that you don't die. You don't. Physically, maybe.  there's no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it won't 

Recording: (2771/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2772/ 10721) 
 Right. The hardest, both the hardest and easiest thing I think I've ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized. 

Recording: (2773/ 10721) 
 that you really didn't need, because then you get more bang for your bucks. 

Recording: (2774/ 10721) 
 You know not that I'm talking negative about my mother that she has some neurological damage 

Recording: (2775/ 10721) 
 Um, well, just even like the parks. 

Recording: (2776/ 10721) 
 Not the actual going through it, you know. To me, it was to her, but the aftermath, basically, you know, you just... 

Recording: (2777/ 10721) 
 If you read it to yourself out loud, like if you're in a room by yourself and you read out loud, do you remember it better than if you read it silently? If you hear yourself say the words. 

Recording: (2778/ 10721) 
 older kids. 

Recording: (2779/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'm actually like a month older than him. 

Recording: (2780/ 10721) 
 And I didn't do that myself, but we had a couple of boys in the outfit who could find where we were on a map.  happened, where our OP, our observation post was, and where the enemy out here was and all that.  It was interesting calculating, trying to calculate where your cells were 

Recording: (2781/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure yet. At least based on money raised, it looks like George W. could trample almost anybody. But George W. has  and  to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean, but I don't think that I'm average in that I don't go for the 

Recording: (2782/ 10721) 
 Oh, is he? 

Recording: (2783/ 10721) 
 It's pretty much a ritzy place. 

Recording: (2784/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2785/ 10721) 
 I know, I don't, I do not want to go, I don't want to touch the computer when I go home. 

Recording: (2786/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (2787/ 10721) 
 That doesn't so much bother me, it's just having it forced on me. Like I said, it just sort of gives me a different opinion of it. 

Recording: (2788/ 10721) 
 I got a bad heart, I don't know what that'd do to me. 

Recording: (2789/ 10721) 
 I adore you. Oh yeah, okay. Oh yeah, boy, yeah. Yeah, stupid.  But I like to do something like that. I wouldn't mind having some kind of place for, you know, you see a lot of  Different down-and-out type people and everything and really nobody really trying to help them or nothing, you know and I 

Recording: (2790/ 10721) 
 That's a roundabout way of getting there. 

Recording: (2791/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (2792/ 10721) 
 Avoid Windows 2000 at all costs. Stick with 98. Much better. Much better operating system. 

Recording: (2793/ 10721) 
 The United States knows about it. They can sit there and they'll pay the welfare. They won't do nothing to him. 

Recording: (2794/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I've been thoroughly spoiled. You know, like, catfish bish subs, those are kinda... 

Recording: (2795/ 10721) 
 Right, right. That's the amazing thing about this country is that there's enough space in the United States and North America that you can have all these incredible  monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them. 

Recording: (2796/ 10721) 
 Well I don't think they should be responsible but I think kids go to school and they need role models, good teachers and I think  schools have gotten a lot better about that. It seemed like in the late 80s, early 90s, you know, the schools, a lot of them were really bad. I think finally  the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids. They can't do everything and they

 Yeah.

She has a PhD and she does a lot of reading and she said that she actually read a study that they did from breastfed babies  to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their IQ is equivalent to a regular bottle fed baby.  and a baby exposed to lead poisoning.

 But you know he just drinks all the time to try to ease the pain and the pain really should have been done gone by as much as he drank in his life.  So, I think there's a lot of people that can use that as an excuse.

 ride. 

Recording: (2938/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (2939/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's projected like six years to finish some of these projects. It's unreal. Well, I know we drove through Georgia. You actually see people working on the road.  There's a whole bunch of people and they're all out there working. You get to Ohio, there's something on David Letterman had a picture of this and I think I've seen it before.  your tax dollars at work, you know, and there's the construction guy smoking a cigarette, leaning up against the side kind of thing. It's like, great. 

Recording: (2940/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2941/ 10721) 
 Just how like to how there's no real like Everybody conforms to their own set of norms in each group. You know, it's like people  people  how society develops in general, how high school is kind of true to life but then really different too on how life is. 

Recording: (2942/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2943/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (2944/ 10721) 
 I know, well to me, the cholesterol level and the health from that food has got to be so bad. I mean, my only downfall is I love Taco Bell. So when I'm like working out in the yard.  and mowing and edging and trimming and wash the car and I'd look at my watch and I'd go, oh hell, I deserve a break, I'm going out to lunch. Well, most people would go somewhere really expensive, I'd go, what?  I want a Mexican pizza and a Coke. 

Recording: (2945/ 10721) 
 Right, well... 

Recording: (2946/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2947/ 10721) 
 at that point though you're so influenced by your peers. 

Recording: (2948/ 10721) 
 I don't think anyone really affected anyone too much as far as that goes. 

Recording: (2949/ 10721) 
 You just get the booklets, you call, you ask the questions. 

Recording: (2950/ 10721) 
 I don't know. I don't particularly like anyone. 

Recording: (2951/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2952/ 10721) 
 I think there's a heck of a lot more to it than what we'll probably ever know. They really haven't checked into the background of the parents as to what their beliefs were in Arizona.  And I think that's a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidentally happening where some kid shoots another kid you know  and the parents are responsible for it and everything, these two kids deliberately went in to kill. And they wanted to kill more than what they killed.  you 

Recording: (2953/ 10721) 
 Yep, I graduated from Brookhaven.

Recording: (2956/ 10721) 
 That's great. 

Recording: (2957/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2958/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I've lived with my mom since then. 

Recording: (2959/ 10721) 
 And that's the way I felt about it. I'm not saying that that's not a possibility, but... 

Recording: (2960/ 10721) 
 Um, no. I have a beautiful niece. I love her to death. I knew at a young age and actually wanted to  make it a permanent decision but doctors at that time wouldn't do it. I was like 25 and I knew no they wouldn't even consider it. They said you'll change your mind and I knew I just never felt a  mother instinct. It's funny, yesterday, actually, last night, we went to visit a friend of ours who had a baby two days ago. When we left the

 I like organizing big projects for them. My husband is director of engineering for Liebert.  the weather in Columbus, he always says, well go anywhere you want. Where would you like to live? Well I want to stay here. I don't want to go anywhere yet until all my kids are ready. And then my daughters always say, okay mom,  As soon as we're all done with school, then we can all move to California, but we have to go as a group because I'm real, real close to my children. 

Recording: (2962/ 10721) 
 I had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted to know what I did for a living and I told them, I said, well, we're done. 

Recording: (2963/ 10721) 
 Like here I've been told you know, they've been here for a while then there wasn't any parties here for a little while and  And then I've been to ones in Cleveland, Cincy, Dayton, Akron, Detroit, New York, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. 

Recording: (2964/ 10721) 
 Well they were none of my friends that were pregnant and I'm not sure they, you know, I just remember a couple girls that were pregnant. I don't, I wasn't  with them and I'm not sure about who their boyfriends were or anything like that. 

Recording: (2965/ 10721) 
 It's funny because I studied Russian but a lot of the people I served with were fluent in Spanish or something else. I don't know why they got sent there.  I mean, we really believe that it's inspired. They send your name and a picture and your application to the prophet who is the head of the church.  and they pray over it and they decide where you go. 

Recording: (2966/ 10721) 
 Sometimes I think that it's just like math sucks and it's like 

Recording: (2967/ 10721) 
 and it was suspect, he still ruled in their favor. 

Recording: (2968/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he was he was giving me phone numbers for at least two or three hours. We had several phone books and like a church calling list.  and some other obnoxious stuff. We had just bunches of numbers. And so he just fed me names and numbers and I went through them. It's not 10 after. Okay.  And so let's see, at the end of that, there was a lot of supporting Aaron, and then there was some calling of like family people younger. 

Recording: (2969/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2970/ 10721) 
 I'm not going to do it. 

Recording: (2971/ 10721) 
 Oh, I don't really think so. I think of myself as kind of an impatient person, but I guess I don't get  I get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and I don't yell and scream at them. I mean, I realize they didn't ask to have a learning disability.  Some teachers think they're just being belligerent and if they want to straighten up they could. What I try to tell those teachers is they can't change their learning disability 

Recording: (2972/ 10721) 
 It's like, hey man, you know, I buy you a beer, you know, or whatever, you know, I'm sorry about what happened. We were shooting at him five years ago, you know.  I try to forget things that, you know, I mean, my mind got enough to absorb, you know, without worrying about, which I do worry quite a bit about things.  about stupid stuff like that. Somebody gets mad at you because you're a 

Recording: (2973/ 10721) 
 You know, it's, you know. 

Recording: (2974/ 10721) 
 It was because I had grown up with these people. I hung out with all  all these people that were part of my youth group and I hung out with them and hung out with them and I came to Columbus and met a whole new group of people. I mean every year I've been down here I've met another, you know.  thousand people and they're all different. Every year they're all different people and that didn't happen back home. I keep meeting people and it's just really fascinating.  you 

Recording: (2975/ 10721) 
 So I do hope that she does, she is a good writer, I do hope that someday she can be able to do that. 

Recording: (2976/ 10721) 
 driving around in the big city compared to out in the country, man. I mean, you're flying down 71 or 70 through town, and you go as fast as everybody else is going. And if they're going 80, you're going 80.  And if they're going to, you're going to. I mean, my dad, I brought him down to Columbus a few times, because my dad and I are real close, and I'm driving around.  I'll zip in between cars and he's like, I forgot what it's like living in a city because he used to live in Chicago but that's one of the things I 

Recording: (2977/ 10721) 
 is both physical, mental, and spiritual, but the majority of the problem is spiritual. And when you talk to people that know that, 

Recording: (2978/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2979/ 10721) 
 It was, we had a little gallery, we were in Clintonville for a year or so and then we moved to Grandview and it was just fine art, we call it fine art crafts and it was  handmade stuff from local people and we had a lot of jewelry and pottery and silk and paintings, that kind of stuff. 

Recording: (2980/ 10721) 
 Heh heh. 

Recording: (2981/ 10721) 
 So like 30 of them will go out at one time and 30 will come back. Well, that isn't too bad, but they're mixed in with everybody else that's normally flying like all the airliners and stuff. So, and they want to get their ASA.  So, you know, I just don't feel comfortable doing that much at one time. I mean, OSU was not a dead place, you know, it was very busy. It's like the third biggest city in the world.  Ohio. But yeah, it's amazing and they're only open 16 hours a day. 

Recording: (2982/ 10721) 
 disciplined, I would be screamed at, may get jumped on the floor to do push-ups. I mean, it was it was just 

Recording: (2983/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm.

 Mm-mm. Right.

 Bye. 

Recording: (2986/ 10721) 
 So she's very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that. So she's basically disabled and that goes, when they do that it's because of your education.  and also they take into consideration everything. 

Recording: (2987/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. I was stationed, permanent duty station was in North Carolina. 

Recording: (2988/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2989/ 10721) 
 So I'm taking it in high school. 

Recording: (2990/ 10721) 
 but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do? And they got to think of that. They have a free education and they just don't think of it that way. You know, they think they can make enough money, but  But, you know. 

Recording: (2991/ 10721) 
 Well, I often have to write on papers. I believe you turned in the wrong paper. I believe I got the rough draft instead of the final copy. Do you have the final copy somewhere at home?  and 

Recording: (2992/ 10721) 
 you know, what goes on in the community. 

Recording: (2993/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 you know, hook it up real tight with guys, but he really likes these guys. 

Recording: (2997/ 10721) 
 A lot of people have switched from being like the really quiet, more reserved people to the party animal. 

Recording: (2998/ 10721) 
 And the bad that we've talked about I think will be a part  of that 10 and 20 years from now, but I think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act, if you will.  to the political question, I think the financial things, I think we will start slowing that down. I think we'll have less influence. 

Recording: (2999/ 10721) 
 A computer called you. 

Recording: (3000/ 10721) 
 Threatening her and stuff like that and Towards all I'd have to do is get on the phone and sit there and say you know I can be out there in about two hours, you know  So I don't know what your problem is, but you need to get you to talk to me about it Talk to your mom about it go see somebody else and talk to him about it 

Recording: (3001/ 10721) 
 And that's the generation I'm talking about. Those are the generation that went through the depression and so forth. I feel sorry for your generation.  I don't know, which was my daughter's generation and probably my son's. Because I don't see how in the heck, wages aren't going up that much.  of consumerism is going up, somewhere along the line, the consumer is going to have to start getting a little wiser. 

Recording: (3002/ 10721) 
 It takes a long time to realize, and this kid can't focus. But with the kid that's all over the place and doing the, tapping this kid's chair and the kid goes.  Make him stop tapping my chair. You know, you can see right away that he can't focus because when you're, he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he's like all over the place while you're explaining.  he's not listening, you're trying to show him something, he won't look at it. You know, it's like people often say ADD kids can't 

Recording: (3003/ 10721) 
 And then after the money runs out, they come back and then start up teaching. Wow, that's fantastic.  Okay. So that's not a thing you don't have to like, like, like, you have to have like, like, you know, like, like a doctorate or any like sort of credentials whatsoever, as long as you can,  You know, talk the talk.  Really? 

Recording: (3004/ 10721) 
 do also. He always voted so I learned at an early age that it's important to vote. My mom and dad were both alcoholics.  I have two brothers, no sisters, one older than me, one younger than me, and I have no children, but I have a pet that is my child. I always say pets are  Children you raise, pets you spoil. So my pet is very spoiled. 

Recording: (3005/ 10721) 
 just from what he's learned. 

Recording: (3006/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he did.

 Cry. 

Recording: (3008/ 10721) 
 or crazy. 

Recording: (3009/ 10721) 
 I mean I didn't have the greatest childhood, I don't think any of us ever really had the best, you know, but I don't like to talk to my kids the way some of these people talk.  Well, one today, you know, she got on the bus and a little girl went and sat over here. She's probably about...  8 maybe 6 or something like that and she wanted to sit here with mommy so she made her sit with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kids trying to study her homework you know 

Recording: (3010/ 10721) 
 and 

Recording: (3011/ 10721) 
 I think it is because when I was a sophomore in high school before, it dawned on me that tab A and slot B had any relation to this stuff that we were learning  with the charts and the diagrams. But I think kids are a lot more aware now because of what they're exposed to in movies and everything, TV just  daily life, they're a lot more aware. They go into it with a lot of myths and 

Recording: (3012/ 10721) 
 to 

Recording: (3013/ 10721) 
 No. No, She-Ra. 

Recording: (3014/ 10721) 
 That's alright. 

Recording: (3015/ 10721) 
 They don't. I mean, we've got two new stadiums and we haven't got any increase in school funding. 

Recording: (3016/ 10721) 
 I'd like to see that implemented, something like that in the United States. That'd be a neat thing. Because I know iron foundries and the low  lower paying jobs. They hire people that are illiterate and things like that and they can't give paychecks out on Thursdays because everyone will call off on Fridays because they all go out and get drunk.  I don't know what they do with their paychecks. I know that's a big, big problem. 

Recording: (3017/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3018/ 10721) 
 way to go pastor, you go do it, we're gonna cheer you on. The job of a Christian is to go out and spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. That's the job of a Christian.  And there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that's what the original, that's what a Christian's supposed to do. And that's what our church does. 

Recording: (3019/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3020/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (3021/ 10721) 
 He didn't. 

Recording: (3022/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3023/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3024/ 10721) 
 I'm 52. 

Recording: (3025/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I figure right now I might as well take advantage of it. 

Recording: (3026/ 10721) 
 I know, those are your hauls. 

Recording: (3027/ 10721) 
 I took a class for word processing 1 and 2. I took those.  I tell you truth. I can't remember if they taught me how to balance a checkbook out 

Recording: (3028/ 10721) 
 I  smaller than eight inches, you go to jail. 

Recording: (3029/ 10721) 
 I probably would like said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3030/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3031/ 10721) 
 I'm gonna cry. 

Recording: (3032/ 10721) 
 They have honors classes which are separate and they're supposed to be with better faculty and smaller class size and a little more challenging. 

Recording: (3033/ 10721) 
 I see kids that are like, I'm not going to have a second. And they would walk over and pick something up and go... and then put it back down and keep walking.  know I told Joyce I said you know I feel like I'm an ogre because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goes no she says they don't want it she says they just want  to see what it's like. Their favorite toy when they were little is I would go to Lazy Boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from

 Mm-hmm.

 I was marathon training and I only got up to about 9 miles and I have unfortunately about 50 pounds of extra weight on me but even like I said when I was skinnier I have like a  I'm okay to run the lower, but I'm not going to run the higher. 

Recording: (3036/ 10721) 
 It wasn't publicized to the degree that it is now. It seems like any more nothing is sacred, I mean, as far as the papers are concerned.  That's something else that I guess I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think we need all this publicity about all the sexual escapades  of all the people that have notorious lives.  you

 where she works and this is just OSU's breast cancer place. 

Recording: (3038/ 10721) 
 I travel across the state and country and before that I was always traveling.  to fall semester, back time of semester, not quarters. And we'd get on a Greyhound bus, 15 hour pass, and Buddy and I would just travel all over the country and sleep in  the bus at night. 

Recording: (3039/ 10721) 
 Well, in 

Recording: (3040/ 10721) 
 Well, all together, I started in 91. 

Recording: (3041/ 10721) 
 and fired him. 

Recording: (3042/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (3043/ 10721) 
 Not that they could have stopped it, but they should have known what was going on. I really think if they were close with their children, they would have known something was wrong.  with these kids who are so removed and don't talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways, you know that they're going to...  turning a different, you know, I just, I blame them though. 

Recording: (3044/ 10721) 
 But we go out and look at we do it differently in sports, but we do this differently in the secular world. 

Recording: (3045/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (3046/ 10721) 
 I don't even read it much. It's very conservative, very Republican. Yeah. 

Recording: (3047/ 10721) 
 And it's interesting that they advertise that when you go there, though, if you get that room, that's what you get. 

Recording: (3048/ 10721) 
 You'd sleep in three pairs of sweats, so you'd lose about two and a half pounds in your sleep. 

Recording: (3049/ 10721) 
 or something like that, just for something to do. 

Recording: (3050/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (3051/ 10721) 
 So we'd be like a waitress or clerical. 

Recording: (3052/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (3053/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3054/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (3055/ 10721) 
 would you do? Oh God, I feel like I was a parent before I was a parent. That's the way it felt. Some of my friends, like,  Like this guy I used to hang out with, he used to run into lockers in high school. I'm like, that is so kid. 

Recording: (3056/ 10721) 
 And he had been through a counseling experience before and he just played along with it then to get out of it I think. 

Recording: (3057/ 10721) 
 It didn't hurt me none. I think it just depends upon, like I said, a lot of factors. It's your neighborhood, your neighbors.  Most kids don't have nothing to do in their neighborhood. How many empty lots do you see nowadays? It still comes back to, like when I was a kid we had go-carts, we had mini-bikes.  We had all that kind of stuff. 

Recording: (3058/ 10721) 
 Historically, you know, my dad's people were Democrats, but then they turned Republican because they thought they were supposed to turn Republican, I guess.  But, you know, there's some of the conservative values that are very important to me, you know, but then there's some social things that  are all important too. 

Recording: (3059/ 10721) 
 No, it was kind of disturbing actually. 

Recording: (3060/ 10721) 
 I make them do their webbing and get their rough draft started and then they can go to the computer because I find they are a little more creative when they get to  think about adding pictures and we call it publishing it. When you get to the publishing stage. 

Recording: (3061/ 10721) 
 I had stuff in and there was a paper they used to send to parents of students. I think they stopped publishing that. I had stuff in that frequently.  I've had some stuff in lately and I'm working on football stuff right now 

Recording: (3062/ 10721) 
 Really? Okay. I didn't know there was like a ripple effect for a stir. I thought, you know, being so remote, you know. 

Recording: (3063/ 10721) 
 But then in the very next breath they said, well in two weeks we're going to California to visit Paul. Now, anyhow I was telling each of my children, because I was upset  And I was telling him this, and they're all going, oh, mom, my older girls are going, oh, you know. And my daughter, who's 13, is fabulous. She is so blunt. She is such.  She's just so out there and so different from so many other children. And she said, well, do you actually care if he comes here? You don't care, do you?

 watching it for a while period and then since Deep Space Nine left I needed a little Star Trek fix every once in a while. So I started watching it. I also don't have cable so it's on UPN and  53 doesn't come in terribly well, so sometimes it's like, I don't want to kind of see what's going on. 

Recording: (3068/ 10721) 
 No, no, that's where have you been, shit. 

Recording: (3069/ 10721) 
 which I feel has been completely devoiced in America because of the effects of the Cold War.  I've inherited this world where there were of... Where am I going with this?  I mean, the generation before us had like Vietnam, they protested against it. I mean, they were in many ways protesting against the generation before.

 So I should really realize this parking situation, but like I said, I usually walk and today I don't really feel like it.  a baby in about two weeks here. Really ready to get this over with.

 graphic design in particular. After I quit wrestling I got really into computers so I pretty much live on my computer now.  you

 Right. 

Recording: (3073/ 10721) 
 I have a very general opposition to this kind of thing no matter where it is anymore. My being 76 years of age has a major  you're bearing because I see the total destruction of our center cities. And I say when I speak of center cities, I don't necessarily mean just cities  the size of Columbus which is the largest one in the state of Ohio now, but I'm talking places like Washington Courthouse which maybe have 15,000 or 

Recording: (3074/ 10721) 
 Four years ago? I don't know. It's been a while. Four and a half years ago, something like that.

 There are some foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding classes. 

Recording: (3080/ 10721) 
 You just keep going. That's part of life. You pick up something, you learn it, and you keep going. 

Recording: (3081/ 10721) 
 And that split second I was like, okay, he's gonna do this to me, he's gonna do this to my kids. 

Recording: (3082/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (3083/ 10721) 
 Well. 

Recording: (3084/ 10721) 
 Yeah, across the street is the dental and the hospital. So people were really loud down there. 

Recording: (3085/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3086/ 10721) 
 things out of that maternal milk, why can't you instead of getting off the shelf? 

Recording: (3087/ 10721) 
 Feeling very good. 

Recording: (3088/ 10721) 
 I got one sister. 

Recording: (3089/ 10721) 
 now. 

Recording: (3090/ 10721) 
 Well, my grandmother was ill. 

Recording: (3091/ 10721) 
 About the same number. 

Recording: (3092/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, they do. 

Recording: (3093/ 10721) 
 Well, it starts with allowing, Heather has two mommies. 

Recording: (3094/ 10721) 
 And they're less hyper about like, you know, bad things for people to do, you know, the drinking, the smoking. They're just not as strict about it.  it basically. 

Recording: (3095/ 10721) 
 it kind of yeah. Well I've seen worse so. So and they're doing this I think  it's called sit and reach where he's got to sit on the floor and he's got to raise his feet up just so and he's got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and they do that for  you know, like five minutes the first time and they increase it and he really hates it. 

Recording: (3096/ 10721) 
 I'm sure it makes it easier, but I think that a person can establish a relationship, you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship.  I think that even if I were working, you know, with my oldest daughter, I worked, but I arranged my life around her so that even though I had that degree, I waited tables because when she was little,  before she started school, I could go to work at 5 in the evening and she went to bed at 7.30 so I was with her all day. Then when she started school, I switched over to lunches  you 

Recording: (3097/ 10721) 
 motherly instinct towards you know and they are like oh Eric you should have one and you know and he knows I just knew at a young age I've always loved  the animals. 

Recording: (3098/ 10721) 
 So I figure it's much better to be nice to them. There's also times when everybody makes errors. And maybe one of these times you make an error and I tell you to turn one  way and you go, you know, like there's an airplane over there and I tell you to turn that way and I really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back and go, do you mean left or right there? And I go,  Yes, it is correct. Turn left, you know. So, you know, everybody helps everybody out. You know, I feel kindness goes a long way and the pilots the same way. Most often, 

Recording: (3099/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah.

 Really. 

Recording: (3103/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3104/ 10721) 
 It's like, we don't have one at home because we're worried. 

Recording: (3105/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3106/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3107/ 10721) 
 Right, right. And again, if it's criminal activity, you want somebody to stop it and know about it.  I'm not doing anything I want anybody to know about. What's to prevent them from going and finding out what some company's doing, what research is.  threat on the web too is that you can connect into somebody's system and they don't know you're there and you can see what they're doing. If they're doing research, developing a new product or something, you 

Recording: (3108/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (3109/ 10721) 
 I feel. 

Recording: (3110/ 10721) 
 I didn't know that. 

Recording: (3111/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (3112/ 10721) 
 I haven't been paying a lot of attention to it just because... 

Recording: (3113/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (3114/ 10721) 
 Oh my gosh. It's one of them, like, you know, falling out of trees. 

Recording: (3115/ 10721) 
 wouldn't have even stopped. He's sitting there going, what are you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff? I said, I want him arrested, man. He took my necklace. Tried to take my  radio too and I kind of threw that in there and make it sound bad. I was on my way to work, man. I didn't want anything bad to happen to me.  or him. So all in all, the cop put the guy in handcuffs, put him back in the car, and he goes, well, do you want to press charges? 

Recording: (3116/ 10721) 
 Um, I'm a Lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell

 Well my son started in public school for kindergarten and he just, my son is a very social child.  will say. He's the one that talks too much. There's a teacher saying he's a social child. He talks too much, he likes to get up and run around, and he needs something very structured.  He needs time to run around, but he needs something very structured. You get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little, and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play. 

Recording: (3118/ 10721) 
 It's in a T shape and the side of the building, all the sound just rolls right up the wall. And this trash track made so much stinking noise. It was ridiculous.  every single morning at 2.30. I developed the ability to sleep through anything. And that's one of the fascinating things  things when I go home, dead silence. Dead silence. And that is now where I have a problem sleeping. Because there's no noise. 

Recording: (3119/ 10721) 
 So it's been very difficult for us, particularly the last four years. And about the time he ran away was between the time my father-in-law died and my mother-in-law died, which  was in a five month period so my wife's had a lot to deal with. She's had a lot to deal with in that time. 

Recording: (3120/ 10721) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (3121/ 10721) 
 Yeah, so they adjusted that, but then they didn't have any way to enforce that. 

Recording: (3122/ 10721) 
 Hopefully. 

Recording: (3123/ 10721) 
 And that's just. 

Recording: (3124/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (3125/ 10721) 
 reason to vote against him. Then if any big issue comes up, that's just going to be added to everything else. What you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and pray  praise him and that he's doing a good job and that we're moving along steadily. And I don't think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means.  I made that mistake when I was president of the Dayton Education Association. We were trying to get a levy passed. So we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school, all 

Recording: (3126/ 10721) 
 No, actually I was going to get my GED after that. 

Recording: (3127/ 10721) 
 I know, exactly. 

Recording: (3128/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and everybody's going to associate with people that they feel comfortable with. So, you know. And unfortunately, as that guy, this guy in particular, he was the center for the football team.  team as he grew up older, you know, he realized that he wasn't as big as important as he, he blew out his knee for OU, you know.  But I went to school with Larry Hunter, who's the basketball coach for OU now.  you

 No, then you wouldn't be too familiar with everything. 

Recording: (3130/ 10721) 
 not the neighborhood thing as much. And you can't let them run around as much as we did. We rode our bikes everywhere. We rode to the pool. We rode down to the  And now you're scared to let them ride around anywhere because you're afraid they're not going to come back. So yeah, it's so many different things.  It wasn't bad. 

Recording: (3131/ 10721) 
 We're still working those problems out. Yeah. 

Recording: (3132/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3133/ 10721) 
 get like more of a respect but it's just like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in your life like especially in  I  going to love it. I mean, it really influences too like how, like what you want to do with your life, you know, and people don't really acknowledge that too much. 

Recording: (3134/ 10721) 
 or take me to court again. They got the money, I don't. 

Recording: (3135/ 10721) 
 Yes and no. I mean, in high school it was a bunch of little things. Here it's not so much a lot of things. 

Recording: (3136/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3137/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. 

Recording: (3138/ 10721) 
 It's just. 

Recording: (3139/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (3140/ 10721) 
 Well I should tell them that they should love themselves. The girls should, both of them, should love their bodies and not give it to a boy that's falling all over  you and you feel all good in this and that. You should respect yourself and love your body and don't give yourself to somebody just because you're  feeling good. And the boys, I should, the boys need to

 uh... i think uh... high school and elected people are so worried the standards you know for a school things but uh...  I think it's kind of like, it's really hard to, like I've thought about it before, just what's wrong with the education system.  system in general. I think it's more of a... College is a little bit different, I guess, but it's more of like this whole

 Mm-hmm.

 right? 

Recording: (3151/ 10721) 
 I'm a camper. 

Recording: (3152/ 10721) 
 Well, in law enforcement, you'd start out and you'd do exercises for like two hours. 

Recording: (3153/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think they're trying to do more. I'm hoping they will. 

Recording: (3154/ 10721) 
 I went back and did a one year schooling to get my nursing license. I became an LPN.  So I don't have a degree. My husband has a degree. I put him through school. I finished his private school. 

Recording: (3155/ 10721) 
 No, I'm living, yeah, that's my bro call. 

Recording: (3156/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3157/ 10721) 
 And a lot of it was the bitterness of the divorce. 

Recording: (3158/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure I'm ready to go back through all of that. 

Recording: (3159/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3160/ 10721) 
 It is, but that was good for New Albany to have that. I mean I think it was great to have it there and I think a lot of people  did enjoy going there because there's not very many women tournaments that come around here. 

Recording: (3161/ 10721) 
 You talk to a computer always. You deal with a computer. 

Recording: (3162/ 10721) 
 politics, I mean, we grew up  or came of age after the Cold War was over. I'm very cynical about this. I have a fairly leftist political  stance. 

Recording: (3163/ 10721) 
 OK, now I have Dover, ferry to Bruges, Belgium, and then train. 

Recording: (3164/ 10721) 
 and psychology.

 I'm on the computer at least six hours a day.

 Yeah, I'm North and I can't even say that. Okay.

 and a Tencent store, theater, I forget, a couple other shops. And when Orrin was  About, I don't know, five or maybe six or seven years old, he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there.  at all. So one day, Grandma gave him, I don't know, a quarter.

 Heheheheheheheheh 

Recording: (3169/ 10721) 
 there's no need to attack students over it and I read some article in the lantern I don't know why I read that I hate that paper but anyway I read some article  article that the guy said he's not trying to attack students, he just wants them to get annoyed so they'll go whine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment. 

Recording: (3170/ 10721) 
 That was part of the reason. 

Recording: (3171/ 10721) 
 So... 

Recording: (3172/ 10721) 
 Gear your writing for a fourth grader and everyone will, that you, everybody that's going to read the memo will be able to read it. 

Recording: (3173/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3174/ 10721) 
 and there's tubes and all that. I mean, I remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking at that thinking, that's me, you know. 

Recording: (3175/ 10721) 
 Do you know a group called Midnight Oil? Yeah. They're pretty good. I like them. Yeah. 

Recording: (3176/ 10721) 
 You know what I mean? It don't matter to me whether you're black or white. It matters to me whatever way you treat me. Like when I first got out of the services, when they really started affirmative action, I was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they couldn't hire me.  because that was when they first come down with a mandate that they can only hire blacks. 

Recording: (3177/ 10721) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (3178/ 10721) 
 who ran that particular campaign would have lost. And I like to think that age doesn't matter, but she came across as old to me also.  I like to think I'm not prejudiced on any issue, but if there was someone who had been right on the issues, I don't care if she was old, I would have voted for her.  I just didn't support the issues I supported. She was wrong on, I didn't like that she tried to use the police chief in such a negative way. 

Recording: (3179/ 10721) 
 He was taken in by a family that was members of the Mormon church.

 I  You know, there are certain, like my car, I love cars, and you know, you take the car to car wash, it's like $7.50 or $8, and you wash it in the driveway and it's about a quarter.

 realized why I was in engineering. I had applied to three colleges my senior year of high school. Ohio State, on a whim from my dad who told me to apply  supply there because I could get in without any trouble whatsoever. Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy. Now, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, and West Point are three of the top ten  and

 It was revolutionary when we announced we were going to use IBM PCs for access to the system and we'd provide you software. You could do some of the work that you're used to doing with us.  in your computer. And it's like it was incredible. We had trouble with the demand. It was like triple what we expected. Librarians were ready for it. 

Recording: (3188/ 10721) 
 Now you will hear me way too much. 

Recording: (3189/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3190/ 10721) 
 But that's how I see—on the roof, I see the old man's name.  regular crop they had when they were out there, my parents, was kids. 

Recording: (3191/ 10721) 
 Well, let's see, I got divorced when my oldest was three and my youngest was about six months, almost a year. So I've raised them basically myself.  Yeah, so I did go back to work. 

Recording: (3192/ 10721) 
 or Ohio, yeah I think. I'm not really sure. I know they're from Ireland. 

Recording: (3193/ 10721) 
 But you understand what I'm saying. You're going to have to make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal. 

Recording: (3194/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's pretty much what we was made to do. Back in the pioneer days you didn't have this crap with the kid going  Yeah, fix me some canned ravioli or... You gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his own meals.  That's an interesting thing I just saw in the news week. I was reading that.

 Trying to cram organic into my head 

Recording: (3196/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3197/ 10721) 
 Do they have like these big lecture halls over there too? 

Recording: (3198/ 10721) 
 They're afraid we're going to get them addicted to the internet or something. The Nintendo and those type of things are bad enough. They're a good babysitter.  You need to limit it. 

Recording: (3199/ 10721) 
 A little bit, yeah. 

Recording: (3200/ 10721) 
 I've never known of him. 

Recording: (3201/ 10721) 
 which was, see with those guns of ours, we figured within 10 yards was a hit.  If you had one of those things, 37 pounds of TNT would go off within 10 yards of it. 

Recording: (3202/ 10721) 
 but it's teaching him discipline, responsibility. You can't do these things at this time, you know. 

Recording: (3203/ 10721) 
 Just because you sin doesn't mean you're going to hell. 

Recording: (3204/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, and my daughter is the opposite of that. But he would do that. And so he wasn't.  He was very frightened. He wasn't learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble.  problem, but he didn't understand what was going on and if there wasn't a structure, he would go to school every day and not know what to expect. Because it wasn't like, we'll do this and then 

Recording: (3205/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3206/ 10721) 
 That's why they have such sharp claws, I guess, so they can lock in. When those hit your head, that would hurt. Kamikaze Kowalski.  and the community. 

Recording: (3207/ 10721) 
 and bleeding, so we had to go back to the hospital. And then we went around, driving around, looking for my son. And this was not unusual. It was a horrible period.  I think what made my wife and I the angriest was that he's the only one that really could control his behavior, the others couldn't. 

Recording: (3208/ 10721) 
 No, no, no, no, no. I mean, she's a great person. She's a good Christian, but there's some things about her that I would not want in a wife. Ake Snay on that.  But I've been single since probably March. And I'm probably going to stay that way for a while, mainly because I don't like anybody. Nobody likes me.  it that way. I don't 

Recording: (3209/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (3210/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, yep. 

Recording: (3211/ 10721) 
 It 

Recording: (3212/ 10721) 
 And some of that's controlled with medication now, but not all of it. Because of the drug and alcohol, they won't put him on some of the medications. But as far as I can tell,  he's been pretty clear and clean on that and you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she's taking very good care of herself she she  lately has been going with him to the psychologist. And we've been paying for it, but we don't have a problem with that because he's going. He likes the 

Recording: (3213/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3214/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. I have no idea. 

Recording: (3215/ 10721) 
 like that war divided people. But I would tell many, many women that they had to vote for Clinton because it was the difference between protecting Roe versus Wade and not  and in protecting choice. I'm starting to see that now even in the Gore campaign. I've seen a couple of editorials in the paper.  about the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three Supreme Court justices. And if you want to protect that right, you've got 

Recording: (3216/ 10721) 
 and it's like I like how, it's like I thought about going to Antioch but it was really expensive and like, I don't know, but just because it's in schools, more of a non-traditional  type where they give you like evaluations and you don't get grades like so so then that's what that's what I heard it's like in Antioch where the professor writes a couple page paper  on your performance on the quarter. And that really shows that, and that's a lot of work for the professor, but that really shows that he's really involved in noticing what

 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

 because they kicked me out for some dumb reason. They confused me with somebody else and I ended up taking the blame. 

Recording: (3220/ 10721) 
 part of the aging process and also partly because I've noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it's the center that tends to rule.  When I was in college, we had a bumper sticker that said, America, fix it or forget it. Some of the construction people in Dayton came out with one.  that said America love it or leave it and today I realize that both of those positions are wrong. It's America love it and fix it just 

Recording: (3221/ 10721) 
 No, not at all. I would have rather voted for McCain over Bush because Bush, he comes from a political family, which I'm not saying is wrong because the Kennedys were a big...  political family. But I'm saying like Bush is, he just seems like he didn't really, like everything's been handed to him in life. And  The issue of like whether he did drugs not that that's a big issue, but I don't like the way he addressed it You know that to me just if you did drugs, okay, everyone 

Recording: (3222/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3223/ 10721) 
 So I started watching and got, I don't want to say into it, because I know people who are really into it. I'm pretty into it, but it's not the same kind of thing, I don't think.  Back when I started doing the painting, I graduated from high school in 94, just to put things in a little perspective. So it was my first couple years.  years of college, from sort of the second half of high school to my first couple years of college, I just sort of, just, I don't know. 

Recording: (3224/ 10721) 
 He has different levels of things that people need at different ages and things like that. At 40 you think wow you really need to make a difference or do something and  and I can see that because I've gone through all the phases that he's talking about.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (3228/ 10721) 
 I know, and you know, and the thing is you're going to have a great time with your kids. And it's just, it's almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have  it like this it's worth it. 

Recording: (3229/ 10721) 
 Um, actually, I guess it's something that's always sort of been there. I've always been real big on just building things, been real big hands on.  And last summer I helped my dad build a garage onto his house. Like I mean literally I mean we poured the foundation and everything like that.  I just filled everything up from there. And it turned out really well. I mean it was really fun to do. I mean, it's, I liked it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time. 

Recording: (3230/ 10721) 
 It's more our society than the guns, I believe. It's more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself.

So like the songs that their friends are listening to  and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they're still acting like a fifth grader. You know, they're not interested in girls and they're still listening to music that younger kids would like. They're just  Generally, socially, they mature a little slower.

 whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make 75 cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted 80 cents at the hospital and  a dollar on main campus and stuff. So that's kind of a sticky situation because they've always kept the university and the hospital separate budget. They are  definitely a separate budget. The hospital, I can see where they're coming from. Everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that. 

Recording: (3272/ 10721) 
 I think screening would be very difficult, especially because at that age you're going to have a lot of people who  or people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said, I mean, they can play off whatever and unless they were.  You know.

 I'm trying to figure out what else to tell you. I worked here at the university 24 years.

 And the questions aren't easy. I mean, I doubt if I could pass some of them. I mean, I probably could pass the citizenship.  and the English and maybe the science because I like science and I keep up on that stuff but I doubt if I could pass the math because I don't teach math and I don't use math that  much other than just normal, you know, add, subtract, multiply.

Recording: (3339/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I thought that was interesting. So it is a values, you know, the Christian values thing. I don't have a problem with it. We had a little problem  It was like my son had to learn the Hail Mary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us, write it down for us because we didn't know and they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong.  And we didn't know, you know, little things like that. But it wasn't a problem. There was a problem with my son for a while because

 That's pretty extreme.

 when I started dating at almost 17. So no, I think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are.  I personally don't think a school can do it.

 I said, this will never work. I'm not interested. Take it back. And he said, no, no, no. Just let's just work with us. Just work with us. We'll take care of this. So I end up selling to him for 144.  But it was just funny because I thought I thought they're never gonna get to where I have to be and we're not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (3344/ 10721) 
 And that's what I'm saying, atoning for sins. It's quite a hypocrisy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they do  I mean in the church in Zanesville where I went and buried my grandparents and went through all my life. Over the door of the church is a picture of Christopher Columbus with a missionary.  a priest and all his men with his sword drawn, a dead Native American at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear. Now,

 No, but I have two daughters and two sons. I heard my daughters talking about they want to do something special for my 65th birthday.  They had given me a party on my 60th, so I don't know what it's going to be, but I think they'll do. They talked about something in the way of a trip, so maybe something  the three of us can do together. So I'm just

And depending upon  And whose foot fit those shoes, those would be the person who wore them. It wouldn't be the one who had worn them in the spring, because he's growing in the meantime.  And it may go to another another and I can remember we passed shoes down as many as four wee children now my dad also repaired shoes 

Recording: (3348/ 10721) 
 And when I started as an apprentice in the shop, they said, well, we'll start you at a dollar an hour.  That sounds pretty good, you know, in 1945, the fall of 1945. So then, as things worked out in Washington, D.C., they came  out with a GLI Bill of Rights, we found out that that would apply to apprentices too.

 to work for that aspect. We asked them if they wanted to go on a project with the class and so forth. Fine, but you've got to participate in it too.  We'll match you with what you come up with. We made them part of the owner. We gave them responsibilities. They grew up with that aspect.  They learned by being around some older people, which I think was good.

 I'm not that party-wise, can I? Well, he's already 16 years old, and I'll wait till you're 16 years old and you'll be allowed to go to parties, because by that time I'll expect you to be able to know what to do.

That's a special campaign for a particular issue  or a candidate, I don't know how you get people to vote. I don't know why they don't think it's important. Maybe because we've had it too easy. My grandfather didn't.  My grandfather didn't, I mean there was a king and queen and he had no right to vote. So when he came here and he could, that was the most important thing in the world.

My grandmother also died during open heart surgery, so my perception of open heart surgery, even though I'm a nurse,  It's not very good just because of the two.

 I'd say. And then I'd also say that, you know, because a number of reasons that people don't vote for school levies now is because they don't have kids in the schools. You know, but education is  the foundation of a democracy. And if you don't have an educated citizenry, your democracy could go down the drain. That was why Thomas Jefferson  and founded so many schools, or the University of Virginia, and believed in education, because he said, without an educated citizenry, you won't understand the issues.

And they're not nearly, they're not the,  the evil people that everybody back home in our community always said they were. It's just like, these are normal people.

 Yeah, I mean, I want to see how the season ends out. It's just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing.  I mean I think every show sort of has a peak. Some shows peak towards the end, some at the beginning and sort of level off. The Simpsons had a stretch from like  their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes I think and this this season it's just

 So if you want to give me two more minutes to play. Okay, now you got another leg. But the thing is...  Let me ask you a question. How does that impact you if you can't be a priest? Aren't there other important quote-unquote roles for women in the church?  church aren't there other important roles 

Recording: (3831/ 10721) 
 Well, I don't know how to explain that, especially if anybody's going to listen to this. I had a friend that told me.  I taught classes, human potential classes, was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement.  So a gentleman by the name of Alexander Evert, who really is the father of the human potential movement, moved out there

 I always wish somebody would do a survey on that and say, back in 65 or whatever, what's the difference between what they're teaching them then and what they teach them now? Is it really that?  It's just our imagination. Just don't remember enough. Yeah. But it seems more to me. And computers really have helped it.

But he said you'd have people with knives, and you'd have people with fist fights.  but you, like guns, was unheard of, you know? And I think, I don't know where this new trend is coming from. I think maybe people feel dejected.  in high school I'm sure of it. I didn't feel that way, but in retrospect I look back and I'm thinking

 Well, I think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes. You know, there's people with good intentions, but...  I just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and you know maybe pull these kids into more  more of a group setting or something and give them more you know counseling professional you know counseling.

Recording: (3877/ 10721) 
 Yeah, if they want, if they, you know, choose. I'm sure there's, you know, women that are lesbians that have been with men also, you know, they've been with a man and  then they've been with a woman now. Now they got a girlfriend. So obviously, you know, and I feel like that was because they had an attraction towards a woman, so now they think they're lesbian.  I don't see, I don't, that's why I think, so I don't think that, but if that's their choice, that's their choice. So I do think they could change.  Bye.

 You have to be a good example. If you're just that for your kids, then that's all they need. You might not always do the right things or say the right things, but  If you're taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right things, I think that's the best you can do for them.

I would have been better off.  back where I was. I would have been better at the job for one thing. And I knew the kind of insanity I'd be dealing with there. 

Recording: (3902/ 10721) 
 I mean I could practically graduate already, I have all the credits, but then you have those required classes that you have to take.

 A nurse practitioner has more authority, I guess, to diagnose and see patients. The state of Ohio is, I think, the only state that has a given nurse practitioner.  practitioners prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions so we can see patients do the physicals we can suggest medications I guess per se but then the  physician has to come in, confirm our findings, and then he actually writes the prescriptions.

 my stepmothers

 they get more support even at that age when they have, they get unemployment because once they've had a kid, even if they're not of working age, they get like  a certain amount of money and then once they reach I think 15 or 16 if they have a baby they're provided they're the top of the list for a council house.

 That's what we're concerned with. You need to interact more with people. We need to interact more with people every day of our life. That's where we learn from. We don't learn by giving things to people.  Just like if you're a parent giving allowance, you don't give your kids money to do chores they normally expect them to do.  But you give them something in addition to develop more responsibility. But we don't talk about responsibility in our society today. I dare you to say where in the heck they say publicly.

Clinton did that also and thought he'd be able to segregate, or not segregate,  desegregate the military and fan out with his first action as president.

Well, God didn't  He didn't teach you to go out and shoot your neighbor, and he didn't go out and tell you to steal from him, and he didn't tell you to ignore him the rest of your life.

It's more things that I pick and choose that I want to do.  do on campus I come down for. So I can't really say it's anything too drastic.

You're not just forgetting about him and let the welfare or somebody take care of him and let him go down the drain. And I think that that  that's what adoption is.

Yeah, when she's not running into polls.  stuff and we'll use them because they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home. 

Recording: (4121/ 10721) 
 tied up to a fence, I think they deserve to die. Because the prisons and the overcrowding, that's a whole other subject.  It's just amazing to me that so many people are in there that should be dead, I feel, because we're just paying for them to live in there. 

Recording: (4122/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4123/ 10721) 
 But she's doing fine. She was dating somebody. I don't know whether they really got married or not, you know, because I don't really have that much communication with her, but some guy younger than her.  I talked to him, he seemed like a pretty decent guy.

 Okay.

Recording: (4126/ 10721) 
 Yeah, right, and the amount of money that is spent is just, I just can't imagine. You know, millions and millions have been spent already, hundreds of millions.  and it's just starting. 

Recording: (4127/ 10721) 
 She's got like a third grade education. She's like a kid herself.

 It's great. Cause he's heavy, he's killing my back. Oh yeah, that's what everyone says, you think. 

Recording: (4130/ 10721) 
 and move on. That's basically my fear. But as one of the guys tried to help me,  said well listen I'm afraid of that too because right there in that pit there that's God. Now if you remember that there's nothing in here that can  hurt you, even as hot as it gets, you know. And when you think about that, you try not to think too much while you're in there. Although

 Well, my youngest son married a Catholic girl who was from a large Catholic family and their  were going to a Catholic school. 

Recording: (4132/ 10721) 
 and

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4134/ 10721) 
 that you're going to develop in paragraphs two, three, and four.

 You're going to cross the street, you know, four-lane highway, and you're sitting there going,

Recording: (4140/ 10721) 
 Hehe. 

Recording: (4141/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4142/ 10721) 
 It's not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway, it's that the homes are worth more because of the school system. 

Recording: (4143/ 10721) 
 I was a professor. It was interesting. I mean, it's a lot. It's hard to remember a lot of terminology, but I enjoyed it. 

Recording: (4144/ 10721) 
 We come to as many games as we can. We both golf and we like hiking, swimming.  Every year we used to go on a trip this year we went to New Mexico we were thinking about moving out there. 

Recording: (4145/ 10721) 
 I know that's why I wouldn't do the hiking thing. So I'm like, great, I can get a visa. Because I had so many times, well, you know, you go to some places in Europe, you might have some problems getting a tourist visa. So sometimes they work it late.  you all. 

Recording: (4146/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4147/ 10721) 
 Put it so it fizzed and you pack it full and you had a gun. 

Recording: (4148/ 10721) 
 if they 

Recording: (4149/ 10721) 
 Exactly. I think that would deter people. You get one strike and you're like, uh oh, maybe I better clean up my act here.  I'm not sure. 

Recording: (4150/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they're Russian Orthodox, same, basically the same thing. 

Recording: (4151/ 10721) 
 and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and we could continue to operating systems. The goal of learning operating systems is real simple. If you're  playing with your computer and you screw something up, the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over. 

Recording: (4152/ 10721) 
 As far as what he did, I'm sure that he probably did go to meetings. But as far as being a leader or something like that, I'm sure he wasn't.  to 

Recording: (4153/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (4154/ 10721) 
 I think more what they need to do is make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or are involved in the crime.  of  countries, I mean, like people in like the Asian countries, places like that, I mean, they have really strict laws. I mean, if you even get caught for like 

Recording: (4155/ 10721) 
 Well, there was a house I didn't want it, so that was easy.

 Definitely.

 I'm just more of a conservative person. I mean, I'm not sure exactly what his platform is, but I've seen him speak a couple times and  I don't know. He just impresses me more than Al Gore. 

Recording: (4158/ 10721) 
 Man, that hurt her to go. She thought she was neglecting me. 

Recording: (4159/ 10721) 
 No, I don't think it was because I grew up just basic, not even really Christian, just really no real religion.  and I'd been going to Presbyterian Church as I was about 19 years old, looking for something, a church. I just had a feeling that I wanted to have that experience.  that in my life because I never had that before. And so I was just looking around and I was open to anything. I'd listen to 

Recording: (4160/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (4161/ 10721) 
 Oh my gosh, they just... 

Recording: (4162/ 10721) 
 They'll also let them work 75% if they're sick. I had a heart attack, had to come back to work early because I was on a sick leave. And like I said, I've been here 25 years and they would not even put me on first shift.  because they said it wasn't a good enough reason. 

Recording: (4163/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (4164/ 10721) 
 They always find some silly way to slain his words and make him look bad and it's really disgusting. 

Recording: (4165/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4166/ 10721) 
 Okay. I better go.

 We can get to the beach and take them there. We have family in Florida. We have family in Hawaii. We have family in Virginia Beach. 

Recording: (4171/ 10721) 
 Alright. 

Recording: (4172/ 10721) 
 you know, somebody lied to you, buddy. He said they were just looking at him like, you know, no way. They were like, nah.  Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (4173/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4174/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4175/ 10721) 
 Is that is that where people go snorkeling? 

Recording: (4176/ 10721) 
 Well, a long time ago, when they signed the declaration and everything, they said, you know, build a fence around your place and take care of your own, you know.  I think basically that's the way the philosophy should be. I think there's times when you need to be, when we need to go help out other people, but we try to be too much of a policeman. 

Recording: (4177/ 10721) 
 thing. I really think that that's most of it. I don't know how people, I got a letter the other day and I can't remember  the name of the personality that was doing it, but he's sending out these things about how you can sign up to take a right in and say, don't have these kind of TV programs on anymore. Where they use the profanity, where they use the drinking, where they use the  dope and were the use of vulgarity. And I understand this thing about him being a

 Um... 

Recording: (4179/ 10721) 
 Nationals getting that way too. They're all getting that way anymore. Used to be analysis with the news. You don't get that at all anymore. 

Recording: (4180/ 10721) 
 so there will still be a Sears and a Lazarus, I mean J.C. Penney and a Lazarus but they're moving to Polaris. And I don't know if they're going to tear  down that, but I don't know what they're going to do with that. 

Recording: (4181/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4182/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4183/ 10721) 
 Not at all. 

Recording: (4184/ 10721) 
 She does a really wonderful job because she has a flair for interior design and so that presents itself in her work.  her, the way she sets everything up in the store. So it's very attractive. 

Recording: (4185/ 10721) 
 I went to for grade school and for high school. 

Recording: (4186/ 10721) 
 something that truly hurt, injured. Not today, however, I suspect my mom could easily be, could have been charged with abuse.  Child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that Green sweat. It was always a green switch because the old ones they would break you don't want to write  Break. 

Recording: (4187/ 10721) 
 or does this say this? This is what I thought this said. Does that what that really says? Well here's a perfect example. The other day my kids, my sixth graders turned in  papers on if I could be an animal, here's the animal I would be, and here's why. And they had to research the animal, they had like a month to do it, and they had to pick any animal and tell about  their feeding habits and whether they travel in groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habitat, what they eat, all that. 

Recording: (4188/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4189/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4190/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (4191/ 10721) 
 She's funny because she's gained 26 pounds and she doesn't look pregnant. She had on a regular sweater today. 

Recording: (4192/ 10721) 
 I know people that sleep outside, and not all of them are veterans and everything, but there again, they don't want to be a part of the quote-unquote sheltered.  system, you know, staying in an open shelter VOA or something like that. 

Recording: (4193/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we could actually use the Granview library. They have a really good library there. Large selection of videos and they have story time things where they read to the kids.  get them interested in books and different type of things where you can win things for reading amount of books. 

Recording: (4194/ 10721) 
 I hear in New York City where it's a lot more populated, it's getting real bad. Of course, you probably know about that. 

Recording: (4195/ 10721) 
 Just general things that I think you should take for granted. 

Recording: (4196/ 10721) 
 But that's my plan. 

Recording: (4197/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we've kind of broken her of that. Thank goodness, the counter stuff. 

Recording: (4198/ 10721) 
 This is weird. 

Recording: (4199/ 10721) 
 to learn about the sweats. There are some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges, which you are not supposed to do. They show step by step how to build one.  tell you what some kind of wood to build it out of and 90% of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood. There's a way to do it and there's a way  to do it. It has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that because the people of this land were given specific

 I met her in high school. She's still in high school and I'm in college. 

Recording: (4201/ 10721) 
 knew the first day he was in here he knew everything that I was going to teach this grading period. Well, that kind of flew up a red flag to me. Can you give him other assignments? Oh no, he's got  do whatever else is doing. So we went to the principal. And I was president of the parents advisory committee at the time, so I had easy access to the principal.  He took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked with him one-on-one teaching database and spreadsheet applications to him. 

Recording: (4202/ 10721) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (4203/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (4204/ 10721) 
 you know what kind of an answer is that? Even if your answer is, I don't know why you can't do it, it just makes me uncomfortable. You know, that's a lot more fair than because I'm the boss of  you or something like that. And I think if you respect your kids and just kind of set boundaries with them, you know, kind of try to be, I don't know, that's the way my family  family's eyes been and it always seems to work really well for us. 

Recording: (4205/ 10721) 
 Não. 

Recording: (4206/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's, I mean, you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is. Let's see what was my...  decoder card was a little more difficult. I had somebody else do it for me. 

Recording: (4207/ 10721) 
 No, no, not at all. She's not watching Ashland. 

Recording: (4208/ 10721) 
 And none of the animals they profiled were pets. I mean, a 36 foot long python, what the hell is a person doing with that as a pet? And they shouldn't be allowed to.  And then people treating a buffalo like they could stand next to it and take a family picture. 

Recording: (4209/ 10721) 
 But how she got there, she started out somewhere. 

Recording: (4210/ 10721) 
 So that's mainly, probably more for fishing. 

Recording: (4211/ 10721) 
 down. 

Recording: (4212/ 10721) 
 Hmm? 

Recording: (4213/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (4214/ 10721) 
 But if you love someone, you want them to do what's right and you want them to learn. And if that's the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong, you still love them, but you're loving other people also.  In other words, you're not letting the fact, this is my child, so he can get away with murder, but this one over here, I'm not going to let him get away with it? No, I'm sorry, if my child committed something that this other one  would have had to pay for I'm sorry you've done that dear but and I love you dearly but I try to teach you different out where you went wrong I don't want to did wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty  So 

Recording: (4215/ 10721) 
 they find out a way to get to him. I dated a guy where we came in on his little brother and he was loading the bullets in the gun. And he had them totally separate like that.  Kids know and they're curious. I don't know. I mean, I'm not for guns because I've, they,  The guns don't scare me, the people scare me. So, no. Unless they have them in a safe or something. 

Recording: (4216/ 10721) 
 conscientious that there are. 

Recording: (4217/ 10721) 
 That's when you take him to grimoire. Yeah. That's what we do. He's got to go. Grimoire night.  But we live with my mom and dad, so he gets to see my side all the time. But he doesn't get to see them as much, so it's like when that night comes on, go to grandma.  Or like we take to him to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets those free 

Recording: (4218/ 10721) 
 Oh, I know. They don't care. They got money, people. Goddamn. 

Recording: (4219/ 10721) 
 the birth control issue became so personal and it was just a decision that had to be made and I had to make it with what I felt was  clear conscience in what I did. I don't have any regrets for it. What about you? 

Recording: (4220/ 10721) 
 I guess I'm also sure I wish they would celebrate every holiday so then they're exposed to all of it instead of none of it. 

Recording: (4221/ 10721) 
 Catholic high schools, but even there, you know, there was, you know, a sense of that and I mean some of the things that went on.  should definitely not have been going on and that was only on a very small level. There were 86 people in my graduating class, you know, and I mean this is a high school with like several hundred students.  that this happened at. 

Recording: (4222/ 10721) 
 are growing up, we push all this and then expect them to deal with it. And they see TV shows and everything else that it's okay to be with  five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she's you know I mean I think it's what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and what we're allowed to  to show our kids. You know you get involved in the free speech and that's fine but wait till those kids grow up and wait till those people 

Recording: (4223/ 10721) 
 But... 

Recording: (4224/ 10721) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (4225/ 10721) 
 I think there's been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that. And I really think, even though I would hope there was a better way to handle it, I think they did the right thing by taking him away from me.  from the cousins. I mean the cousins have been stressing how long he needs family, he needs family, well there's a much closer family than your father. And they love this  country and this stuff, well then accept the laws and follow them whether you agree with them or not. 

Recording: (4226/ 10721) 
 So he won't have to pay for it. 

Recording: (4227/ 10721) 
 That's probably what I'll do, ignore it until like August or July and then start paying attention. 

Recording: (4228/ 10721) 
 An example of that, I asked my manager the other day, she told me I was supposed to do this certain thing. And I asked her, I said, well, they told me I wasn't supposed to. 

Recording: (4229/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4230/ 10721) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (4231/ 10721) 
 I lived, I actually went there for interior design. I lived right off the street. 

Recording: (4232/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (4233/ 10721) 
 It's very hard. I mean, I missed a lot of school. I mean, most people would think that I have a lot of help, but I really don't. I mean, I live with my parents and everything.  And I mean they have jobs too. It's not like they're 

Recording: (4234/ 10721) 
 Although it's hard to do, especially if you're thinking about how hot it is. But if you're listening to people praying, and they're praying with their heart, and I tell you, because of  how hot it gets in there, you'll hear people pray straight from their heart. Not a bunch of real fancy words in a real comfortable setting, you know.  that he 

Recording: (4235/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4236/ 10721) 
 I haven't personally researched it but I have seen, I would personally research it if I was president, documentaries and  what  because a lot of people will research it once it's on TV. That three strikes and you're out has really seemed to work in California because 

Recording: (4237/ 10721) 
 Yeah, stops in front of my house. 

Recording: (4238/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (4239/ 10721) 
 things, you know, collecting, but it's hard with my sister's cats because she has a little girl and no, she didn't go home vacuum every day, you know, but. 

Recording: (4240/ 10721) 
 They really have no self-worth because, you know, I know a long time ago we went to a, what was that, it's like a seminar for the Ivy League school.  which I looked at their tuition and went, ah, you know, there was no way, but, and I thought this is so stupid to be here, but I listened to the man, there was like four or five men talking and some  women talking, whatever. They said, you know, if your child makes straight A's and applies at our school, we don't want 

Recording: (4241/ 10721) 
 One of them's working over here on the stadium. 

Recording: (4242/ 10721) 
 and there's like nothing in it. And you know, it's like go down the list. That's what I do. He just thinks I automatically know I'm a mind reader.  That's what it is. 

Recording: (4243/ 10721) 
 I hope so, yeah. 

Recording: (4244/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4245/ 10721) 
 Well I think in my opinion, I think mainly it's the absence of basically parenting.  My mom was there, she was a housewife, you know, and so she was, she went to work after my  I think when I was a junior in high school, you know, and my brother, all my brothers and sisters are already graduated, you know, so. 

Recording: (4246/ 10721) 
 I don't think that changed my mind about anything. I mean, I don't approve of his immoral behavior, but it doesn't change my mind.  the way he runs the country. 

Recording: (4247/ 10721) 
 I did get better grades last nine weeks, didn't I? Well, isn't that amazing? You were taking your pills then. Some connection here. So you kind of just have to sit them down and  and say, well, let's just go through some of the things that give you trouble. And we'll write them down and say, oh, well, last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all. This nine weeks, you haven't been able to focus on that.  Maybe medicine does help you some. Maybe you're just, you know, not giving it credit. 

Recording: (4248/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean, like, it just, it provides a window of opportunity for those who really do work, like. 

Recording: (4249/ 10721) 
 The snuffer and all that. 

Recording: (4250/ 10721) 
 You know, we really don't know much about his life away from home. 

Recording: (4251/ 10721) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (4252/ 10721) 
 There you go. 

Recording: (4253/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4254/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4255/ 10721) 
 Well, not really. They have a lot of religious beliefs on their own that they've held on to because they just have  had nothing. 

Recording: (4256/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4257/ 10721) 
 Sorry. 

Recording: (4258/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4259/ 10721) 
 So indirectly, it was a very bad reason that I came here, but it worked out. 

Recording: (4260/ 10721) 
 I have become visually desensitized to the violence that I see in movies and on TV, but I still see a distinct difference between  that  that still are very, I still find disturbing. Also, hang out in Little Life. 

Recording: (4261/ 10721) 
 I think that step would be really fun. I've never done it, but it always looks like so much fun to me. 

Recording: (4262/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (4263/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he's a real nice guy. 

Recording: (4264/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4265/ 10721) 
 it cause any huge problems or anything like that. 

Recording: (4266/ 10721) 
 And no, oh, did they? 

Recording: (4267/ 10721) 
 And finally, I don't know whether—we had a Piper Cub observation plane. I don't know whether he saw him or who, but anyway, they finally—  figured that he was in a tunnel for the railroad. 

Recording: (4268/ 10721) 
 The only thing I'm going to do is, maybe two weeks before, I might get $100 from the bank machine. I have three cars, so I probably have one of them full of gas.  Other than that, it's like, you know, to me, if you are, say, Bank One, and I'm Huntington, and January the 2nd, people have all kinds  problems you and I are going to be the laughingstock of the corporate America and you really think you and I want to do that so to me nobody's gonna have a problem because years they're gonna go 

Recording: (4269/ 10721) 
 professors and everything, but I think, you know, they get a lot of these kids and they don't care about school, but they leave early because they know they can do it. 

Recording: (4270/ 10721) 
 And, you know, it's, oh, you've got art? We're open to that, you know. 

Recording: (4271/ 10721) 
 Well, it's like the... 

Recording: (4272/ 10721)

She was a corporate person but a very stupid person.

 Well I get the sense that if there are discipline problems it's so hard to get anything done to solve them unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school. That's the big thing now.  But just that, you know, it's just so hard to get anything done. And I think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they don't see the support throughout through the administration.  If they do have a, they have to wait until something's pretty, pretty egregious before they, before it's dealt with.

Recording: (4303/ 10721) 
 you have to go to dances, you have to do that whole thing. So I really don't know how they would go about doing that. Perhaps, like I know we used to have like a  We had like the administrators actually allowed us to have a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because  because everyone got along those days because you didn't have to go to class. You know, you spend the second half of the day just hanging out. So everyone got along that way and I think that would be a start, you know.

Enrollment's dropping, it's just the way the population goes.  enrollment's dropping, we can't afford to keep them all going, so let's close. And they did this big study and they targeted some to close. Well, there was a big uproar from the people whose kids went to that school.  Like there will be whenever you close the school. So the board backed down and changed its mind. The next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools. But there wasn't the money for it.

It would be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time.  to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one-on-one way. Just because  Because if you're going to teach it to a large amount of students, I'm not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them would probably be making cracks

 you know, with limited money. And I live in a nice neighborhood. I've lived there for 11 years. I've never had any trouble whatsoever.

 Now I was in the Marines. But basically all we did was just go back and forth from like Philippines to Vietnam, then from Vietnam to Hong Kong.  from Hong Kong to Vietnam.

 I'd be taking in foster kids. I raised a little boy from the time he was born until he was six. Well, he was my friend. She's a single woman and she wanted to adopt, but she said she wouldn't adopt.  If he was going to have to, a child would have to go to daycare. And this was when my daughter was, started kindergarten. And I said, if you get a baby, I'll take care of him until he starts school.

Recording: (4523/ 10721) 
 And they had a strong public support over there. It's a really tight-knit community. It's quite different. Columbus needs to learn a lot from that area. And it's a matter of just putting  I guess your hands and you're practicing your faith, which we 

Recording: (4524/ 10721) 
 Hmm.

 If it doesn't affect them, it's not there. And if they don't have to... 

Recording: (4526/ 10721) 
 Oh, it'll be. 

Recording: (4527/ 10721) 
 And it just sort of sparked an interest in me, I guess. And it just grew from there. 

Recording: (4528/ 10721) 
 I think they've got more money. I don't know if that necessarily makes them a better school. I think a lot of it is really what you, as far as  as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it. My family, my brothers and sisters, they all went to public schools and they  took advanced AP classes and they worked real hard. And I think that they have options.

 They were actually able to select a couple. They talked to a lawyer who arranges the options and she had a file and they threw a bunch of questions and answers type things.  were able to limit to three couples and they liked the first couple they met. 

Recording: (4696/ 10721) 
 just kind of move there a little bit. There you go.  I got out of the service, my parents were older and kind of felt an obligation to be around them.  to help take care of them. 

Recording: (4697/ 10721) 
 I mean I was very good in math. Very good in math. I mean I did pretty good in all of the subjects.  chicks. 

Recording: (4698/ 10721) 
 but it doesn't always apply every single case. You know what I mean? I am against capital punishment. The guy that they  executed here in Ohio last fall. Did you know about it? 

Recording: (4699/ 10721) 
 that they get the socialization that they need at home and they're not relying so much on their peers and their peers' opinions. Because I, for one example,  the Pokemon craze. My son didn't know what Pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it. And you know, it's just like stuff like  that. It's just like they don't know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face, you know? 

Recording: (4700/ 10721) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (4701/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (4702/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4703/ 10721) 
 Definitely, it would be nice, but no. 

Recording: (4704/ 10721) 
 That's cool. 

Recording: (4705/ 10721) 
 I keep thinking about that all the time, but I'm like, I want something where I can be off during the summer so I can take my kids and we can go out west or, you know.  Because my wife's in the same boat, she'll retire two years after I do and our kids will be young. I'm a five year old and I only have six years to go, so we're talking 11 years  So. 

Recording: (4706/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and he's got control over that because I mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman that babysits and she did very very well she did all that.  stuff that I would like to be done. She took them to the library. She had nap time at a certain time. They were, you know, laid down and it's just totally different.  the grandmothers. 

Recording: (4707/ 10721) 
 So it probably wasn't unexpected. We just weren't prepared for it. I don't think you could be prepared for it. 

Recording: (4708/ 10721) 
 you know and I just thought I just don't I just don't like this is not so is this something that when I look long term is this something that I want to deal with for the rest of my life and I said no it just doesn't you know and I think that you have to  to look at and see if you're compatible with somebody before, you know, people get into situations and they marry people that you just, from the outside you can look and you can think, are you nuts?  you know that is never going to work. So I think that you just kind of have to take into consideration, you know, are you compatible? Do you really feel like this is something that's going to work and be positive?  Okay. 

Recording: (4709/ 10721) 
 It was just... So I didn't object to that one at all. 

Recording: (4710/ 10721) 
 I would find that hard to believe. 

Recording: (4711/ 10721) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (4712/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4713/ 10721) 
 I'd say of, I think the VVA generally sees on the average 5, 7, 10, something like that a day.  Now, not all of them are homeless. 

Recording: (4714/ 10721) 
 You know? 

Recording: (4715/ 10721) 
 She said that it's like, I don't know, some people who work there, like, I couldn't imagine working complete nights, you know? I mean, I like working 2-3, 2-11. I think I'd rather work like.  Maybe like noon to eight, that'd be better, because then it's like, I mean I'm more toned to staying up late anyways, because of like...  How it is or whatever but like I don't want to have to get up really early either like I can never imagine having a nine-to-five job like that'd be horrible 

Recording: (4716/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean. 

Recording: (4717/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4718/ 10721) 
 The government's always good for money. 

Recording: (4719/ 10721) 
 Yes. But it was interesting. They did have assemblies where they had religious  assemblies. Religion wasn't all invasive in this school, but they did have assemblies.  and for religious holidays and that kind of thing. And I remember thinking, it's 

Recording: (4720/ 10721) 
 But yeah, it's a similar situation to being involved in a car accident.  But I Could say I said she part part thinks the same way now she'd been here, you know, and have  trouble with boys and everything you know when she's growing up and I probably would have could have probably would have been an ass about that kind of stuff depending on how bad 

Recording: (4721/ 10721) 
 It's a pretty dangerous drug I would say for the most part. Not so much the getting high part of it, but just what goes into it. 

Recording: (4722/ 10721) 
 Well, we were in Vancouver, so it's not that far away. We didn't hear about it for a couple days, but I heard that that's all that was on. Every aspect of his life, every aspect of the search.  But do people really need to know that? Do they need to have a driven home? And I think at that point that's where the media, their sensation  and 

Recording: (4723/ 10721) 
 to the other side. 

Recording: (4724/ 10721) 
 is a law that you have to pay for your accumulated time. So I couldn't get a job out there because I had about six years experience they had to pay me for.  So I came back into Columbus, and it's a lot harder to work in Columbus public, but I know the territory. I know where I'm going.  you 

Recording: (4725/ 10721) 
 No, I think I thrive on stress. I think it keeps me going or something. But I do have to do something that is accomplishing  I don't want to sit in an office, I've already done that, day in and day out, working for other people that I don't even approve of, that are making way too much money anyway.  And after 

Recording: (4726/ 10721) 
 Okay. I have two students. Well, one is a student here currently. 

Recording: (4727/ 10721) 
 and then on out and the enemy was over there. Well, they put us in the front of that mountain right down there. 

Recording: (4728/ 10721) 
 like, you know. 

Recording: (4729/ 10721) 
 I make little side bets, not necessarily money. You know, just haha for fun.  Sometimes I did get money for it though. It wasn't too bad. I mean, you know, it's not like some kind of racketeering deal. 

Recording: (4730/ 10721) 
 Ah, they seem to. 

Recording: (4731/ 10721) 
 Is it hard to keep up with her? 

Recording: (4732/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (4733/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4734/ 10721) 
 I started at the real bottom of it. 

Recording: (4735/ 10721) 
 the younger kids wouldn't think anything about it. 

Recording: (4736/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think basically normal hours would be like 8 to 12 and then you go home during lunchtime because that's the big meal of the day. You go home and eat with your family. That's really important. 

Recording: (4737/ 10721) 
 You 

Recording: (4738/ 10721) 
 Ew. 

Recording: (4739/ 10721) 
 Clintonville. 

Recording: (4740/ 10721) 
 in LA and then over the next two, three years my sister comes back and forth, no actually  I lived here for several months, I lived there for several months. 

Recording: (4741/ 10721) 
 I did have a white kid my son live in there and that's about it 

Recording: (4742/ 10721) 
 I'm not built that way. 

Recording: (4743/ 10721) 
 And I don't know, Commons I didn't miss. Bus service I kind of missed because Aaron's car is out on West Campus.  But I went home and got my dad's APAS. He teaches in the dental school, but he only teaches on Fridays. So he has that APAS available all the time.  So our car is parked right next to the building. 

Recording: (4744/ 10721) 
 Not so much when I was teaching it, because I think 

Recording: (4745/ 10721) 
 they were helping out the new guys. 

Recording: (4746/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4747/ 10721) 
 They were the majority, huh? 

Recording: (4748/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's true and she likes it, she's really good at it and drives my stepdad crazy because she'll always be like, hey Pete can you come over and put these cabinets in?  I do anything else but um 

Recording: (4749/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4750/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (4751/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4752/ 10721) 
 Okay, let's go. 

Recording: (4753/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4754/ 10721) 
 to approximately a thousand, which his son is mainly operating. Yet he goes out and works too, helps out at this age.  But he is concerned because they've just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developers to come in and  And already they are ready to take over a couple of farms that are fairly close to him, but it affects the whole township. 

Recording: (4755/ 10721) 
 You puke up. 

Recording: (4756/ 10721) 
 which was the purpose of his book, I suppose. 

Recording: (4757/ 10721) 
 and although that's trans meridian we go write that down because i don't know that name you know so 

Recording: (4758/ 10721) 
 intangible. I'm saying you have somebody there because she's giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but what she's bringing about is developing a character in a person to bring about the  spirituality and a person that's going to carry them all through life. She's also tithing, more than tithing probably, which I always  I said the author said 10% tithing knew inflation, he knew great about economics, 10% is 10%. 

Recording: (4759/ 10721) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (4760/ 10721) 
 Well, I think it really still goes back to the mom and the dad and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy.  act this way, would that make my mom and dad happy? Because until you're about five or four, your parents are pretty important to you and what they think. So that's when, you know,  You have to instill that stuff. They learn by watching you do it too. 

Recording: (4761/ 10721) 
 Actually, I live in Clintonville now and it's real convenient, but the houses are so old and I'm just tired of living in an old house. 

Recording: (4762/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4763/ 10721) 
 Really? What did he tell you? 

Recording: (4764/ 10721) 
 I don't know what you mean. 

Recording: (4765/ 10721) 
 mom's a severe alcoholic. 

Recording: (4766/ 10721) 
 You're still here? 

Recording: (4767/ 10721) 
 objectives because when we went into the service and then went overseas, our objective was  do away with Hitler and Mussolini.  I'm just thankful that he wasn't carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something. 

Recording: (4768/ 10721) 
 Yeah, things that are like simple chord changes, and you can just fool around with on them and stuff 

Recording: (4769/ 10721) 
 His, my boyfriend's aunt and uncle, their kid has that really hyperness. 

Recording: (4770/ 10721) 
 Not for the train. 

Recording: (4771/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4772/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4773/ 10721) 
 I have to get a job and support myself, so. 

Recording: (4774/ 10721) 
 Yeah, right. First of all, they're not really in love with you. And secondly, you're wrong. So when I came here, I didn't date.  you 

Recording: (4775/ 10721) 
 getting like you know 90s and above but 25% are getting F's and D's 

Recording: (4776/ 10721) 
 years. 

Recording: (4777/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it is a really disciplined school, but it's a lot of rebellion at the same time. 

Recording: (4778/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we did. We had a, they're called LAN parties. They're parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook them up to, into a network and then you play games. 

Recording: (4779/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (4780/ 10721) 
 All right. 

Recording: (4781/ 10721) 
 So you knew, you've heard about that probably. 

Recording: (4782/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (4783/ 10721) 
 what's bad about where I work at, it's not so much racism as, whereas if you're my supervisor,  using this example and I'd do something wrong. 

Recording: (4784/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4785/ 10721) 
 Oh my god. 

Recording: (4786/ 10721) 
 That's going to be a problem. They said bring water. They have no dress code, which is nice. So I'm just going to wear shorts, some good walking shoes, and a t-shirt because it could get rough.  It can get real rough, I bet. 

Recording: (4787/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4788/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4789/ 10721) 
 I think it would help. I do. I am against religion in school. I just don't think they should push that on people. 

Recording: (4790/ 10721) 
 I was raised. 

Recording: (4791/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4792/ 10721) 
 She always had these spiral notebooks and she'd stop and get an idea for a poem.  from something she was working on. I don't know what, but anyway, she wrote quite a few poems, some of them real good poems.  I thought, most of them of more or less a religious nature and moral nature. 

Recording: (4793/ 10721) 
 You 

Recording: (4794/ 10721) 
 So she's doing that. 

Recording: (4795/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they're just so 

Recording: (4796/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (4797/ 10721) 
 I do think there's some and I don't think they'd probably get exposed to like the different walks of life. I don't think they'd probably be exposed to you know the gay lesbian  I think that would probably just be blown over and they didn't go very much in depth about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty, but on the other  hand for me that was fine I don't know our friends that have an 11 year old that's going to public school I mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (4798/ 10721) 
 None at all. He's always had very definite opinions of how his life should be. 

Recording: (4799/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4800/ 10721) 
 to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes. And it's not right, it's not fair, but that's the way it is. So I didn't  want to go into law, didn't want to go into paralegal. I was looking into that and lady kept pounding me and telling me, you know, maybe you could get in it to make a difference.  I'm like, why would I want to make a difference if it kills me? You know, because I know myself and I don't put up with crap. You know, I see a liar, I bring him out. 

Recording: (4801/ 10721) 
 like. 

Recording: (4802/ 10721) 
 You do. 

Recording: (4803/ 10721) 
 us. So, I don't know. I think a lot of it's the family unit breaking down in general, you know.  And secondly, I think to be honest, I think the media has gotten a little carried away. They sensationalize it.  they're going to get recognized, they're going to have their name go down in history. Unfortunately, I think that has something to do with it too. It's frustrating to 

Recording: (4804/ 10721) 
 You don't have too many options, you know? 

Recording: (4805/ 10721) 
 I see, I mean, you see, the computer can't be wrong, he said. 

Recording: (4806/ 10721) 
 too much. 

Recording: (4807/ 10721) 
 No, we actually had student tickets that people didn't want clear up on C deck, but we enjoy it because a lot of times we walk. 

Recording: (4808/ 10721) 
 Oh, because some of the newer jets, there's like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner. I mean, it's there are prop planes that are like five times as noisy. 

Recording: (4809/ 10721) 
 And then a couple years later, he was working on a job in the Columbus Coated Fabrics plant,  that makes coated fabrics. The main thing is auto upholstery, car upholstery. Anyway, they had big  rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and those fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system. 

Recording: (4810/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you gotta remember it was all swamps back when I was a kid. Like I said, I grew up down here. It was mostly farmlands when I grew up around here. 

Recording: (4811/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (4812/ 10721) 
 Some of them are athletes. They're pretty much just preppy, student council. I'm good at school but bad outside of school. They go out and party outside  but they join all like the students against drugs programs. 

Recording: (4813/ 10721) 
 Now I haven't been over there since then. 

Recording: (4814/ 10721) 
 It's like, you know, yeah, like a hundred hours a window in one week. Oh, man. 

Recording: (4815/ 10721) 
 it's a good place. they even stopped playing the ghetto music. they have this jukebox and it was horrible. they played the same three songs with horribly offensive lyrics and no melody whatsoever.  whatsoever. 

Recording: (4816/ 10721) 
 For me personally, family being close, both sides of the family are here. For me, familiarity. I don't like a lot  of change, a lot of new things. For me, I was involved in, I swam for OSU swimming and got real involved with the OSU sports and just the sports  sporting programs and I love Ohio State football so I like the sports. There are a lot of activities to do too now with my little boy going to Kosai and the zoo. 

Recording: (4817/ 10721) 
 have of Germans are those of Bavarians and not real Bavarians, but stereotypical Bavarians, beer drinking, bratwurst eating, sauerkraut eating.  later hose wearing 

Recording: (4818/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4819/ 10721) 
 back in the early 70s. And then I transferred to Worthington in 76, and I've been there ever since. 

Recording: (4820/ 10721) 
 I bet. Yeah. 

Recording: (4821/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he's... Yeah, he's 26. 

Recording: (4822/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly. That'll solve the problem. 

Recording: (4823/ 10721) 
 right 

Recording: (4824/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (4825/ 10721) 
 they have specific programs for the children. I think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that if a kid has bad behavior or  a bad attendance that you send them home. I mean, I think that's the most ridiculous thing. Like, surely that's not a punishment for a lot of these kids. And, you know,  at least in England on these things I've seen. They send them home and these kids are just doing whatever, going around the neighborhood shoplifting, bullying, hot wiring. 

Recording: (4826/ 10721) 
 Oh wow. 

Recording: (4827/ 10721) 
 Okay. I'm thinking people who backpack are pretty cool. 

Recording: (4828/ 10721) 
 Oh, yeah, they showed they cut open this pulling this baby out of this little hole of this lady's stomach And I just I had heart surgery when I was younger and so I've had lots of needles and those types of things  And when it comes to needles and that kind of stuff, I'm just kind of squeamish about it. So that stuff, I just don't want to see it. 

Recording: (4829/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4830/ 10721) 
 of the year, I mean, it just got to the point where I'd had enough and I didn't want to go anymore. 

Recording: (4831/ 10721) 
 But right now with his attitude the way it is, I'd say that me and my family are better off not having him stirring up a bunch  of conflict or whatever. 

Recording: (4832/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4833/ 10721) 
 Yum. 

Recording: (4834/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think so. I think in high school there was, or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school. Because there were pregnant girls in my high school.  you 

Recording: (4835/ 10721) 
 And, well, actually, a neighbor boy whose draft number was  smaller than mine. 

Recording: (4836/ 10721) 
 Geez, something doesn't sound right through the airways or through the writing. Something's mysterious going on here. And he found out they were having difficulties. Well, divorce became acceptable.  Before it was a no-no. Now it's acceptable. And then you had the celebrities becoming more notable. Oh hey, we don't get married.  Then we have the idea of doing away with cash. Gold metallic backing. 

Recording: (4837/ 10721) 
 That's a good way. 

Recording: (4838/ 10721) 
 Yeah, over the years we've had situations like that, you know, a pregnancy here and there, things that people needed to get worked out, or someone being worried about  a neighbor being abused, a child being abused and not knowing what to do about it. So yeah, but you know, I, it's.  I'm just lucky. I'm so lucky. 

Recording: (4839/ 10721) 
 Okay, one, two, three, four, five. Testing, testing. When I was  The kid, my father, got this tapered car in the days when they were those big, you know, the wheels. 

Recording: (4840/ 10721) 
 Aren't you holding it? 

Recording: (4841/ 10721) 
 Well, that's what everybody, when I tell people I play it, that's what everybody says, but it seems to me that any instrument can be hard, depending. I mean, I can't see how anybody can play a.  clarinet, for example. But there are some things that are hard about playing the French horn. One is that you can play many different notes with the  single fingering. 

Recording: (4842/ 10721) 
 and you uh... it's just like the game battleship pretty much you know a four a two a seven and uh... well for three dollar one of one  probably four out of five you know in that I haven't bought that many of them but in that race  right there four out of five is not too bad. I got my mom one on her birthday she got $15 and  you 

Recording: (4843/ 10721) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (4844/ 10721) 
 I  When you're little is when I think you learn loyalty. I love the old Detroit Tigers from the 80s. That's when I learned to like. 

Recording: (4845/ 10721) 
 Yeah, if it's a nice day on the weekends, I... 

Recording: (4846/ 10721) 
 So he's going to be somebody who can complain about something. Well, that's another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook.  You know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water Make some toast, but you know that's about  all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking, even if they do have to cook for their family. Not everybody, not every female likes to cook, you know, they just do it because 

Recording: (4847/ 10721) 
 and they can't find it and you're like, alright, alright, look on the catalog where it says MEM number, that would be your membership number and people are like, oh, alright, alright. But, I don't know, like, I  I really want to get a job that's in a warehouse or something, something really easy where I can just load boxes or something.  Never have time to really I mean like I try and do like can I try and do yoga? But it's like we work to 32 11. So it's like by the time you get home. It's 

Recording: (4848/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (4849/ 10721) 
 I mean, I don't know enough about it to really say, but I can't. I mean, I don't know where they got that. 

Recording: (4850/ 10721) 
 She was, but I admired her more. Because until the moderates get control of the Republican Party again, that's going  to be the litmus test. It was just like back in the 60s and the 70s when the extreme left wing had control of the Democratic Party. They would nominate such people  as McGovern, who I voted for but had no chance of winning. Over the years, I have moderated my hardline  left. 

Recording: (4851/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4852/ 10721)

 Sure. Um, I grew up in Lima, Ohio, and which is only about an hour and a half from here north. I came here in 1991, I believe.  here being Columbus. I got married about three years ago and right now I'm in the process of doing a little bit of everything. I've worked all my life.  I've been doing this for about two years. I've been working part-time and doing crafts.

 You hitting on me? Get the hell away.

 It all gets, I don't know, it all works itself out. Every other day you start him on taxes and he'll just start fuming. 

Recording: (4860/ 10721) 
 kids start dressing and getting in a clique together, you know, it'd be hard for them to intervene and say, oh, what's going on in your life? What's your, what's the problem? You know, that's, that's not really  should be their role. But if they care enough, they should call the parents and say, look, we're worried about your son. He misses a lot of school or he's  starting to dress really, you know. Sometimes, and it shouldn't be that dress has a lot to do with it, but it seems when kids go a different way, it does involve dress.

 Double A major.

 OK. So he got expelled from Catholic school for behavior problems.

 Do your thing. 

Recording: (4864/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4865/ 10721) 
 Not really. I mean, I don't think they'd come to any more difficult conclusions than guys had coming up to. 

Recording: (4866/ 10721) 
 Helps the curve. 

Recording: (4867/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4868/ 10721) 
 I don't know. Those kids lacked something in their upbringing.  And I don't know what it is. Thank goodness none of my kids ever took that sort of attitude.  And I'd like to think that my wife and I set them a good example.  you 

Recording: (4869/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's what they suggest doing is two years of med school, get your PhD, and then do your last two years of med school.

 So we walked across the street to the church.

 He is. 

Recording: (4872/ 10721) 
 They're also talking about the actors, the reason they're ending it is because  I think that's a really important point.  The character development is the most important part, I think. So I think that'll be a failure. But that also sort of tells me that they're going to leave things kind of open. 

Recording: (4873/ 10721) 
 I know. I know. Well, it's good to have that. I think it would be good to have that leeway. But I'm not sure I would trust myself because there were definitely times when I was teaching when I would have more  of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others. And I wanted to be fair in terms of not cutting down the ones that I didn't like that much.  Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (4874/ 10721) 
 Nah. 

Recording: (4875/ 10721) 
 So they knew that this Bush name would bring out a lot of money. Which it has. He's got a lot of money to work with. And you know that doesn't seem fair either.  there. I don't think the average person in the United States, the average person, doesn't think that your policy  Politicians should be bought you know 

Recording: (4876/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I guess. I just have the nerve to scratch and stuff. Like, my rings, I'll twist them because they bother me. Like, I don't wear this all a lot.  It's one of the days I did.

 disability and I have different abilities now, same abilities I used to do but I have to do them a different way. Just because my  brain functions on a different level and I can't explain that to anybody and I shouldn't have to but I'm always forced to.  But trying to find a job, you know, resulting from this has been difficult and that's, you know, 

Recording: (4878/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4879/ 10721) 
 but he'd bring in a nutritionalist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah

 That's the grocery we use. Yeah. 

Recording: (4882/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4883/ 10721) 
 So he did it. Well, he's always had some problems. His problem  I'm saying focused on things, unless it's something he's extremely interested in, then you can't get him away from it. If it's something he, it's, just an example, in school,  He would sit there and he'd be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they're trying to teach something in class or it's working on a writing assignment or something. They have a half hour to work on a 

Recording: (4884/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4885/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (4886/ 10721) 
 a hunter and everything you know I knew it when you shot something that died it wasn't it wasn't a game you know and  I'd hate to think that that would cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody else. Shoot another human being, I mean, that doesn't...  I don't even know why there should be any concern for it. 

Recording: (4887/ 10721) 
 he was on KP one day and he said they had a big, an area out away  from any of the other buildings where they burned trash and that sort of stuff. So he said, the mess sergeant said, should we make our ticket?  of trash out and burn it. You probably better just take some gasoline to throw on the stuff to get it to burn. 

Recording: (4888/ 10721) 
 run quick, put plastic on.  Oh, I don't know. It seemed like it's a tough call because it's a very unusual situation here at Ohio State where they have a union and they have so many different  skills in a union. You think of unions, you think of auto workers, you think of pipe fitters, you don't think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (4889/ 10721) 
 It's kind of frustrating but it's probably good for me because it's hard for me to  Just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to believe, you know. I just want to convince them, but I can't do that. So it's a good exercise for me.  look at it that way. Just letting them go ahead and

 Yes.

 references when I speak. When I'm hanging out with friends, someone mentions a subject and I'm like, hey, Simpsons made fun of that at some point.  That's the effect that it sees on me. I don't think that's too big an effect. People are always used to, you know, like quote Shakespeare or something. I guess that's  ten times more elevated, so like, oh, but that references the Shakespeare line or something, but I mean, it's a part of our culture and I'm a part of it. 

Recording: (4895/ 10721) 
 hot wiring cars at the age of 10 or something. I don't know. I think I do have sort of very  opinions about people who are having all these kids and don't take care of them at all.

 Because he, well I've had five babies, you know. I really have to work, when you talked about that, the older you get, I have to work really, really hard to stay in halfway decent shape.

 Yeah, I don't know where they're going now, but

 I couldn't imagine being locked in a room for a few days. 

Recording: (4899/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4900/ 10721) 
 And because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and think for myself and so I'm exactly what they always said they wanted. It's just that they can't handle it.  handle that. And so when I was in seventh grade and I got in a lot of trouble about the whole racial thing because I'm from a school where I was mostly  White students were 

Recording: (4901/ 10721) 
 Yeah. And that's the thing about schools too. I totally disagree with uniforms. Unless it's all slacks.  all of it because you get the girls in the uniforms and they're short and they can't enforce that they don't enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me  that this one teacher put the girls up in the front row. I should have went and met him. I should have said, hey, you know, he haven't met me in 

Recording: (4902/ 10721) 
 Well I think it starts with the family but the problem is in the last 30 years we've emphasized, I shouldn't say 30 years, post-World War II. Post-World War II is where we broke the  family up. And let me tell you how I analyze this. During World War II we took the little lady out of the house and said, hey, we need you on the production lines making war machineries.

 And he looks more like that side of the family. And he was born, we couldn't believe it. We didn't know there was redheads on my husband's side of the family.  of the family and then we found out that he had a great grandfather with red hair and blue eyes. 

Recording: (4909/ 10721) 
 you know, they're supposed to or whatever. And I know some families where the men, the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking.  and the wife does you know whatever she does. I mean it's individuality again. So

So I figured I'd take that time off and I'm going to Otterbein to get my master's in education.

There's one off of Bethel, or no, it's off of Henderson  cahoots and then there's the red hot peppers or something I saw the other day. I can't even believe they're like right across the street from each other. You know and it's funny because you read the  paper and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so I think it really affects it.

Recording: (5011/ 10721) 
 I mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain. It's just coming down all over the place, hail and lightning. 

Recording: (5012/ 10721) 
 I mean you could probably write about a thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your, how many years do you have? Two?  Three. 

Recording: (5013/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5014/ 10721) 
 40 is like the limit. 

Recording: (5015/ 10721) 
 I think they need to educate me on what's important to them and I'll, you know,  I'll honor and respect as much as I can, but even people within different, I mean a Catholic isn't a Catholic.  in my opinion, I mean there are some old time Catholics, I mean like my mom, I mean that they just are very strict 

Recording: (5016/ 10721) 
 Well, no, they don't. 

Recording: (5017/ 10721) 
 Doesn't happen overnight. 

Recording: (5018/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5019/ 10721) 
 So really that's about it. I have a dog who's outside right now and that's it for my kids. 

Recording: (5020/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (5021/ 10721) 
 I'd be a lot more accepted, I think, here. Even though it might be kind of, I wouldn't do that on my own. But if I'm, I felt like that was what I was doing all the time. So I  Full time. 

Recording: (5022/ 10721) 
 You know what I mean? I mean, I hope we're getting to the place we know that. 

Recording: (5023/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5024/ 10721) 
 there and everything that they'll tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else and like an authoritative figure and not believe a damn word they say. 

Recording: (5025/ 10721) 
 I see that. 

Recording: (5026/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly. 

Recording: (5027/ 10721) 
 of  to be able to do anything else any guy can do. 

Recording: (5028/ 10721) 
 Yeah, so... 

Recording: (5029/ 10721) 
 I want I don't want somebody I want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (5030/ 10721) 
 can get aggravating. And when you get to be older, you know, some of those issues can be very aggravating. 

Recording: (5031/ 10721) 
 See, I don't want that to happen to me. Because I just, that's, I mean I had a guy that I did start dating when my son was a baby.  It just he got he fell in love with me 

Recording: (5032/ 10721) 
 I can't imagine that it would have, I mean I'm sure Brazil would have been an even more different experience, but I think it was more just a resentment for sort of everything  about America and what they're fed. It was a real love-hate relationship. 

Recording: (5033/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5034/ 10721) 
 I certainly spent most of my time in the areas that I grew up. 

Recording: (5035/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5036/ 10721) 
 long car trips. One of the families is in Oregon.  the coast. I forget the name of the town. Not far. It's along, I think it's along the coast in Oregon.  near Eugene or something like that. And the other is in Louisiana, I think it's 

Recording: (5037/ 10721) 
 along the Lassie line and leave it to beaver. 

Recording: (5038/ 10721) 
 Yeah, basically for the entire summer. And then if I like it, I'll be enrolling. 

Recording: (5039/ 10721) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (5040/ 10721) 
 He was tough, but he was always tough. And we didn't realize it for years. We didn't have anything to compare it to. He's the only one kid we got. The psychologist told us that.  You know we were talking about things that happened when he was growing up and I said you must have had a terrible time growing up raising him because he was not an easy kid. We didn't know any different. 

Recording: (5041/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5042/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5043/ 10721) 
 No. 

Recording: (5044/ 10721) 
 But if that PhD was given to you, if they lowered the standards for you to get into graduate school, wouldn't that be challenging for you?  They lured it for me. My sister didn't oh she had a rough time getting about now. I can get in here. I got a lower stand 

Recording: (5045/ 10721) 
 Those are unsettling times though, you know. 

Recording: (5046/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5047/ 10721) 
 They probably would have been about seniors in high school or so. 

Recording: (5048/ 10721) 
 But that's because I'm not home a lot. And like I said, my wife's here. Now her mom just moved to Texas. So she's living down in Texas. And she's got  brothers and sisters all over the United States. 

Recording: (5049/ 10721) 
 Not in my lifetime. He'd have to probably be a closet gay. 

Recording: (5050/ 10721) 
 things that the Catholic Church won't like to admit that they're wrong on. And they are wrong.  sit there and ask me to atone for my sins, yet they won't atone for the sins of all the priests that are molesting children still to this day. And they protect them. And that's not right.  And I'm very, very outspoken about that. So rather than banging my head on the wall to people who wouldn't listen, I just decided to let it go. 

Recording: (5051/ 10721) 
 staggered backbeats and stuff. So I can play bass and I have a processor thing and stuff that I fool around with, just doing stuff like that. Some of my friends play on drum machines and stuff like that.  do stuff like that more like it's not it's not like you're playing right like you're not spending records just like making 

Recording: (5052/ 10721) 
 John, no. 

Recording: (5053/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I've been a fan forever pretty much. I didn't really have any other teams. 

Recording: (5054/ 10721) 
 bump. 

Recording: (5055/ 10721) 
 I think this year it's going to be even worse. Stocking up. Water! 

Recording: (5056/ 10721) 
 There you go. 

Recording: (5057/ 10721) 
 I think just having like such a low cost really helps. 

Recording: (5058/ 10721) 
 That was great. 

Recording: (5059/ 10721) 
 Ernest had hiked up her skirt and I'd rolled up my pants leg, where I'd probably not over an E.D. But I think I was good talking to her.  That was all we ever got out of it. 

Recording: (5060/ 10721) 
 under whatever system is popular that day, or card games. 

Recording: (5061/ 10721) 
 Why even add that? 

Recording: (5062/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5063/ 10721) 
 I can't say that it's an expectation. I still say that it has to come from the top down. 

Recording: (5064/ 10721) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (5065/ 10721) 
 I just think you can't call for across the board raises. There are definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they're getting. 

Recording: (5066/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. It's at the same building actually. It's said it's used for different things. 

Recording: (5067/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5068/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5069/ 10721) 
 I didn't even recognize that many of the names. 

Recording: (5070/ 10721) 
 just for the courses that I need. 

Recording: (5071/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5072/ 10721) 
 That's adults. 

Recording: (5073/ 10721) 
 Ugh. 

Recording: (5074/ 10721) 
 God.  Oxygen is in that fluid too. It's in that mist that goes over the fields. 

Recording: (5075/ 10721) 
 He's seven months. 

Recording: (5076/ 10721) 
 I turned him into a zombie. 

Recording: (5077/ 10721) 
 that. 

Recording: (5078/ 10721) 
 So how many years did you actually were there teaching? Three. Three years. Wow. It was fun. I recommend it. 

Recording: (5079/ 10721) 
 But. 

Recording: (5080/ 10721) 
 It's just very comical. I was just like, oh. 

Recording: (5081/ 10721) 
 the mall issue. 

Recording: (5082/ 10721) 
 It's just there we go again who's right who's wrong I have no idea 

Recording: (5083/ 10721) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (5084/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (5085/ 10721) 
 I'm trying to work on my license for skydiving now. 

Recording: (5086/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (5087/ 10721) 
 And it's really sort of interesting. 

Recording: (5088/ 10721) 
 that are the big problem children, because mom and dad go, how can I get them to do something and stay out of my hair? Oh, I know. I'll buy them a Nintendo. I'll buy them this Sega. I'll buy them this.  look they're out of my way you know because you know 

Recording: (5089/ 10721) 
 Yeah. It's awareness.  again. I mean, you know, put two and two together. You get some young teachers right out of college and then you put them with all these high school girls and these girls are looking  like 20 and 22, you can't even control the attraction there, but you can be aware of 

Recording: (5090/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5091/ 10721) 
 Mm-mm, he would absolutely have to build my trust for a long time. 

Recording: (5092/ 10721) 
 Good! 

Recording: (5093/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I work on the auction up there. So I sort of avoid the main campus. It's been a long time since I've been around here. 

Recording: (5094/ 10721) 
 himself in the two elections he ran in. Most real Democrats, the Warren Beatties of the world, and many, you know, congressmen and senators dislike Clinton.  because they didn't think he was democratic enough. I like Clinton because as I said over the years I've learned that extremes in either party  party don't get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who's a moderate 

Recording: (5095/ 10721) 
 It was probably the best thing for me. 

Recording: (5096/ 10721) 
 right after you're done doing all of the spiel about why you think they should accept Christ in their life, they say, okay, that's good for you.  That's the general feeling among people our age, our generation. I mean, what generation are we anyways?  I'm 20, so there's like the generation X, they're the generation right after me, and then there's generation Y2K. 

Recording: (5097/ 10721) 
 the lower grades. We have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade, but not many. But I think that young men, young boys would do better.  in a setting in school if they had a man earlier on, rather than having to wait until they're in middle school to relate to a coach and up until they're in high school.  Until then, it's always been a woman. 

Recording: (5098/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5099/ 10721) 
 Yeah, imagine you learned it in a hurry. 

Recording: (5100/ 10721) 
 Some of the classes I'm taking are probably kind of dangerous, though, like the fumes from the paints and stuff. So I can't.  Have to wait until those are over. 

Recording: (5101/ 10721) 
 for two bucks, you know, you can't beat that. 

Recording: (5102/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Well, you had a good reason to be bothered. 

Recording: (5103/ 10721) 
 and the people that would be decent parent aren't because of the situations and whatnot. Just my family, nobody in my family, my sister doesn't have kids. I don't  have kids. We're in our mid to late 30s. Our friends just had one. I do have some friends that have like more than one, which is great.  because they're just great parents. I know those kids are going to be going in. But then I have other people that, like my other friends that just had one, were trying to help. 

Recording: (5104/ 10721) 
 and the cops on the other side of Chris and now Chris is just near me, trying to be near me. He has no idea what the hell is going on.  I this this sinks in too and I was like you you don't you did they tell you any dude he said I have no idea what's going  going on. And I couldn't do anything about it. I couldn't tell him, I couldn't communicate. I was totally incapable. 

Recording: (5105/ 10721) 
 for everybody so you wouldn't go to Ivy League, you don't even want to look here. 

Recording: (5106/ 10721) 
 I mean, my middle brother was always around. He wasn't very social in high school. 

Recording: (5107/ 10721) 
 I could see that thing, he'd be ducking them, you know. 77 years old, I can't imagine being hurt by him, you know. 

Recording: (5108/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you can't say a noun is always going to be orange and it's going to be slippery. Language is so much more abstract than math and science.  So the abstract areas like history and English and reading and literature, that's where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in  somewhere in the languages. They either can't write, can't read, can't spell, can't do all three, or aren't very good at 

Recording: (5109/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5110/ 10721) 
 And so I think I'll probably end up changing. I don't know what to. It would probably be more towards the education line. 

Recording: (5111/ 10721) 
 sure. Well that and they like Tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and I did I was reading a book and I let her out I let her back  in and I started reading again and I'm looking around and here's mud. So it's kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know you live here it's not the  that big of a deal, you know, because I know my sister would freak. 

Recording: (5112/ 10721) 
 Yeah, now if you, the thing to do is if you know the call sign. 

Recording: (5113/ 10721) 
 So there was a wadi they call it, it was like a little deep oysh. 

Recording: (5114/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (5115/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5116/ 10721) 
 do my billing and stuff. Microsoft money. 

Recording: (5117/ 10721) 
 But my son, he's so... I mean, I don't know if you've ever met anybody that's totally into politics. 

Recording: (5118/ 10721) 
 If we stayed here, probably. 

Recording: (5119/ 10721) 
 When I was a kid, if a neighbor yelled at me, I better make damn sure he didn't tell my dad. 

Recording: (5120/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (5121/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he's teaching us system five. It's just funny. 

Recording: (5122/ 10721) 
 that's how I would like it to be. 

Recording: (5123/ 10721) 
 Right, you know, because every businessman goes, I want to be there at, you know, and it doesn't work that way. You know, you can't, you just can't physically do it. 

Recording: (5124/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, sort of. 

Recording: (5125/ 10721) 
 Well, you need to go. 

Recording: (5126/ 10721) 
 I don't know. This freedom, semi-quasi-freedom. There's an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom.  And the Indian people know the big difference of that. 

Recording: (5127/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5128/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5129/ 10721) 
 Right, you can get it walking down the street. 

Recording: (5130/ 10721) 
 I'm sure you played with it too. 

Recording: (5131/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5132/ 10721) 
 But there didn't used to be, especially in restaurants and everything, and now it's such an open market and they know that they have to accommodate everybody's taste.  I mean, before, no, I'd have to go into a restaurant and a salad, baked potato. There was nothing, really nothing, unless I go to a buffet and then all the food soaked  cooked down, I mean honestly, you know, it's like no nutritional value. 

Recording: (5133/ 10721) 
 He's still in Columbus. He's like some sort of business. I don't understand business whatsoever. Yeah, that's all I know.  It's lost on me. I'm sorry. I don't have a finance head. 

Recording: (5134/ 10721) 
 right across from the courthouse, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (5135/ 10721) 
 or the festivals in the summer that they have downtown. I mean, those are really great. And they're crowded, but they're peaceful. There's not.  There's a lot to do and great music. 

Recording: (5136/ 10721) 
 But that's because I don't think Americans travel as much as the Europeans do. I guess because Europeans, they have more public transportation accessible. They get the trains.  that you're on trains and the buses and just by personal car you can go across the border and then go visit.  like, you know, countries like, like it's so condensed. But here it's like we've got our oceans and it's like we got to like fly. So, so that 

Recording: (5137/ 10721) 
 because conceivably they wanted, what was it, a $2 raise or something? And then they also get free tuition, but only, as I understand it, only a very small amount.  percentage get that free tuition? 

Recording: (5138/ 10721) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (5139/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (5140/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5141/ 10721) 
 But the whole, especially with the first few shootings, you know, with the children, I mean... 

Recording: (5142/ 10721) 
 See what kind of things you're ordering, where your hits are on the internet. 

Recording: (5143/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you really do. Yeah. 

Recording: (5144/ 10721) 
 I don't think that really matters honestly. I mean it's, I mean by the time you get into the Boy Scouts you're usually  eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and I think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like  I 

Recording: (5145/ 10721) 
 must have 

Recording: (5146/ 10721) 
 casting off authority and that kind of stuff. It was about someone making a bad choice, gaining power because of it, and then ultimately seeing the folly of the ways  and dying in the classic tragic hero sort of way. And so I'm looking forward to how they build up to that  point. A lot of people in high school, what the hell are you talking about, Bo? But yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing how things go. 

Recording: (5147/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5148/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (5149/ 10721) 
 Yeah, where the trees were mature and they didn't really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees. 

Recording: (5150/ 10721) 
 It was pretty far. The city actually had a million people that I lived in most of the time, but it was the government that ran it actually was still  communist. 

Recording: (5151/ 10721) 
 So how do you know? How do you know? 

Recording: (5152/ 10721) 
 And you either accept it or you don't. 

Recording: (5153/ 10721) 
 So I don't know whether he had a boat or anyway there was a boat available to him and he rode across the island. 

Recording: (5154/ 10721) 
 with him or anything like that. 

Recording: (5155/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5156/ 10721) 
 be a modern quote-unquote type building in 1962 and it's yeah it's it's flat there's a flat roof with a  Clear story in the middle that has nothing in it. Just it's just empty space over the over the worship center So when you would sing in that?  that is a choir spread out along the front. If you were under the high place, your voice would go all the way to the back. But if you were under this flat ceiling 

Recording: (5157/ 10721) 
 Oh I can whip up a mean fish especially when I go out we're closer to the fishing area now I caught dinner the other night  And heck just about anything I can make turn in I like to get a  patting on a certain kind of omelet I'm not gonna you know 

Recording: (5158/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5159/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5160/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure where my father would have been, and my father was very liberal, more so than my mother. Because if it's not something that's part of your culture every day,  and you've been told it's wrong and the Catholic Church said it was wrong as most religions do, I'm sure he would have had some  concern, but I think his intellect would eventually have worked it out, especially if he sat down and talked with him. And he wouldn't have done, you know, there wouldn't have been any gay bashings. 

Recording: (5161/ 10721) 
 meet kids that kids like. 

Recording: (5162/ 10721) 
 like it's okay i mean it's like a country school which was always over to as i was like me and my friends are always like the way they sever along here and so that was like they speak of the kipi rd  And like that was I guess weird kind of like being the odd people in an  in a small Midwestern farming school is kind of odd, I guess. I don't know. 

Recording: (5163/ 10721) 
 They can't see nothing wrong with that. 

Recording: (5164/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5165/ 10721) 
 I thought it was 43. 

Recording: (5166/ 10721) 
 I know, yeah, I know, it's ridiculous. I'm just, I find that just crazy. 

Recording: (5167/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5168/ 10721) 
 I had to take care of him, but then I saw my wife taking over some of my role at home. So we swing him, that's what I said, a team player. We knew what we had to do.  My son might come home and say, well gee, he might smart off. My wife would say, hey, that's your dad. Give him respect. 

Recording: (5169/ 10721) 
 Yeah, because it's the Midwest. Yeah. 

Recording: (5170/ 10721) 
 A lot of online magazines, music magazines. 

Recording: (5171/ 10721) 
 Yeah, like have someone come and tell them you have this much time or I wouldn't recommend you stay on this program this long.  I know there's programs that if you get on it and they pay you, you have to pay that money back after you get on your feet. Well, I mean, I think someone should be  able to come out and tell you about these things and let you know what you can and have to do to do this. 

Recording: (5172/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5173/ 10721) 
 I told her, well, that's just my identification there. You look on my license, nobody can copy that. You see where the A, U, and M is my last name. 

Recording: (5174/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5175/ 10721) 
 with my kid. 

Recording: (5176/ 10721) 
 Well, at the time they were having a lot of trouble at the school and they just wanted to get rid of some people. 

Recording: (5177/ 10721) 
 don't go into elementary ed that much. 

Recording: (5178/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it was very hard for me to stay in school. I could have easily quit like that because the teachers didn't, I went to a Columbus public school and they didn't care.  I mean, I went through elementary and middle school with straight A's and B's and got there and I was on C's to D's, you know, and it just was really, the teachers didn't care.  You know, if you learn, you learn. If you don't, you don't. If you don't come to school, you don't. They don't care. That was how my school was. So, I don't...  There 

Recording: (5179/ 10721) 
 a child in children's services that came from horror. 

Recording: (5180/ 10721) 
 I've heard some of them talk about it. 

Recording: (5181/ 10721) 
 was working out there. 

Recording: (5182/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5183/ 10721) 
 I just, well, I didn't understand as much as you probably do. I just was like clueless as to what I needed to do to become an art major. And I go to my  advisor and they'd tell me what to take and it was the art advisor but I didn't really think I had to do anything special like I didn't know about the portfolio review  and all that stuff. And that was probably my own fault for not asking questions. But so it took me a while and then I just kind of went to Columbus State and went

Recording: (5186/ 10721) 
 leave it alone for hours like I did this morning, but yeah. 

Recording: (5187/ 10721) 
 Never thought he was any better than anybody else. He was always there to help out if he could. But then some people, like you say, some people weren't that way. 

Recording: (5188/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's the bureaucracy. It'd be too much of a struggle, I think. 

Recording: (5189/ 10721) 
 No, math is just, you can say, okay, here's three blocks, you can touch them. One, two, three, take two away, now there's one. I mean... 

Recording: (5190/ 10721) 
 I'll stay. Yeah, I'm in the guinea pig class of this program through the medical school  where after three years of undergrad, I go to med school here, like without MCATs or anything. 

Recording: (5191/ 10721) 
 That's what I would think in that case. I mean, because the dominant culture is always going to be accessible to them. 

Recording: (5192/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5193/ 10721) 
 I think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister's wet, stinky hair. Because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason. So, wet, stinky hair.  wet because I was crying into it and then more time passes. So some indeterminate length of time later, I look over at the police officer who  standing on one side. The cops are there basically to make sure I don't freak out and that's finally sunk in. I was like, the cops are here so you don't freak. I'm like, well I'm not really in any danger of freaking out, am I? 

Recording: (5194/ 10721) 
 Because they like it. They like school and that's why they came to college. Football was secondary. 

Recording: (5195/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's how he gets so much money. He says, I will be paid this much, and I will be given this much minimum per day, or I'm not working for you.  And they usually say, no, no, no, we won't do that. And then they'll call back a week later. OK, we'll take you. He has some really good stories about that. Oh, yeah.  He just has qualifications with running businesses, is that why? He has qualifications with businesses and also with Unix, which is? 

Recording: (5196/ 10721) 
 each other, you know, using the kid as a medium, or they're too selfish and don't listen to their kids, or they didn't  I don't want to say selfish, but let's face it, like we said, you know, even having a dog takes some time out of your schedule.  not spend enough time with the kids you know they're working what not and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and 

Recording: (5197/ 10721) 
 Have you ever met somebody like that? 

Recording: (5198/ 10721) 
 Well, it's, well let's put it this way. I can go out and make money without even making money off of government agencies if I wanted to.  If I wanted to be a crook, I could be a crook. And I could have people rent me a house, low income, I could move in there. 

Recording: (5199/ 10721) 
 And it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute, nobody, the kids, the principal, or the other teachers. But now it's like, oh, thank you for coming. Oh, thank you for coming.  I said maybe that worked a little bit, but now just in the last two weeks, I think a lot of the retired teachers who weren't messing around with it have come back in.  I don't know exactly what to, yeah. 

Recording: (5200/ 10721) 
 Cuff is Catholics United for the Faith. She graduated from Miami University of Ohio and got affiliated with Campus Crusade for Christ and so forth.  and went out to DeKalbion, working for Northern Illinois, then went back working for the inner city area of Chicago and found herself, she liked Steubenville better.  And when I relocated here people say you're crazy young lady. You're 25. You're moving to Steubenville. They're migrating out of here 

Recording: (5201/ 10721) 
 and you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there. Now, in Port Columbus, you couldn't do that. But you could over there, because you can walk around on the ramp over there at OSU.

 that we should have never been in. We were, let's see, we come around the mountain like there's a mountain here. 

Recording: (5203/ 10721) 
 Mm.

 Oh, really?

 No, I don't.

 which every kid in the world plays with. 

Recording: (5208/ 10721) 
 It was mostly Caucasian and very few Asian and other ethnicities. 

Recording: (5209/ 10721) 
 And so I think it gets driven home. I think the media does that in a lot of places. They pick something that's sensational and keep... They're making it.  even more sensational, like when John Kennedy died. 

Recording: (5210/ 10721) 
 Oh man. 

Recording: (5211/ 10721) 
 It was like giving them a license to be a screw up. A lot of the nurses even who were former addicts, when it came down to doing procedure and doing business,  business  I'm a former addict, I'm allowed to do that. 

Recording: (5212/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5213/ 10721) 
 I think that basically that's in a nutshell they've reached a point in their life where, you know, they're cowards as far as going out and killing themselves, but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking.  themselves a death or smoking you know whatever you know smoking crack or whatever and then you  and just living in a hell, I mean. 

Recording: (5214/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly. And it's just ridiculous, but so many people don't seem to think that way. I do think, yeah, access, it would help if access were restricted.  restricted, or at least if they were more careful about it. I mean, it seems like even the laws that there are in place now aren't necessarily followed and, you know, that kind of thing.  you 

Recording: (5215/ 10721) 
 It's difficult, you feel alone a lot of the time. And I'm not as liberal as I used to be.  age that gets tempered a little bit, but still tend to be a little more liberal. And it's a, you know, it doesn't matter who I vote for, they're going to lose.  And I just stay out a lot of discussions. It was interesting to me, our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed 

Recording: (5216/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5217/ 10721) 
 what I'm saying when I talk to them. Or my mother, very nice human being, and a bunch of people I don't know. 

Recording: (5218/ 10721) 
 me. 

Recording: (5219/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5220/ 10721) 
 Some of them are all of the above. And some of them aren't. There's quite a few of them that have adjusted well to society when they came home.  thing I think when what happened is that there wasn't any joy about like World War II and Korea and everything. It's like you came  off got off the plane and nobody really cared. 

Recording: (5221/ 10721) 
 It's just a rule. 

Recording: (5222/ 10721) 
 Right. And I'm sure it will, especially when you already recognize that. You know, if you already know in advance what kinds of things you're going to be helping along, it's  lot easier than trying to figure out what's going on here, you know? 

Recording: (5223/ 10721) 
 That wouldn't bother me at all. 

Recording: (5224/ 10721) 
 He's an aeronautical engineer. He started off here in Columbus at Janitrol. They went out of business. Then he went to Urbana for graduate school.  I'm  in the city which is kind of heating and cooling air conditioning systems and so he's using his air flow design. 

Recording: (5225/ 10721) 
 Not so much old Star Trek, I like Deep Space Nine of the new ones. Back when it was new I liked the next generation.  Deep Space Nine came out and had a grittier, darker story that wasn't so cookie cutter in fashion. There was a greater degree of  continuity from episode to episode and more character development. It wasn't like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad people. The characters 

Recording: (5226/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5227/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5228/ 10721) 
 Like, not really. I mean, we played with friends, we never played anywhere. Just fooling around in people's basements and stuff. Never really organized enough to try and play.  What did you play? Guitar and bass. And what kind of stuff did you do?  Jam oriented stuff, you know, like the dead like that like I don't know like like like dead more like kind of like reggae type stuff to just 

Recording: (5229/ 10721) 
 They get better and better and better.

 mhm 

Recording: (5231/ 10721) 
 I don't know, I guess that's one way to get you into the business.  I don't know. How do you prepare yourself for teaching in front of a large audience? That's something I would have to, anyways, ease myself into. 

Recording: (5232/ 10721) 
 So, yeah, those places were probably about 30 years old. You know, fire hazards, insulation just, you know.  Fire hazard everywhere. 

Recording: (5233/ 10721) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (5234/ 10721) 
 Well, librarians traditionally have problems with, it's like a form of censorship, big brother things. Librarians have always had problems with that.  I don't know, it's hard to balance it. If somebody's out there actually doing criminal work, criminal activity,  causing damage, you want to know about it, but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else? I don't know how to balance it. 

Recording: (5235/ 10721) 
 Um, not really. He, I mean, he obviously went to church too for at least a few years.  while my parents were still together. But, I mean, since then, I mean, there's really nothing about it. 

Recording: (5236/ 10721) 
 Totally left that part out. No one felt me in about no throwing up or anything. That really made me mad. 

Recording: (5237/ 10721) 
 I don't know how to tell you that. 

Recording: (5238/ 10721) 
 Everybody lives on a farm. 

Recording: (5239/ 10721) 
 Hmm.

 Well, his two main characters in his cartoons were Willie and Joe. 

Recording: (5241/ 10721) 
 in the US. 

Recording: (5242/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (5243/ 10721) 
 That's ridiculous. That's amazing to me. 

Recording: (5244/ 10721) 
 And then my family moved to Clinton Valley. We kind of lived up there. 

Recording: (5245/ 10721) 
 Grandchildren. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Recording: (5246/ 10721) 
 Not really. 

Recording: (5247/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure. I mean, I know no one's come to like, hey, you can get on this and you can get on that. I mean, I know my teacher, she said, I think it's called.  ADH or something and they pay you to go to school. 

Recording: (5248/ 10721) 
 Well, there's plenty of stuff. Yeah, well, it's not like sex. It's a little bit safer, but.  It's kind of just go out with your equipment and if you catch one you catch one if you don't then you don't but  But I've caught plenty of dinners. Lunch, breakfast, all that. 

Recording: (5249/ 10721) 
 It has this little bridge that goes up to the front door and a creek. It's cool. 

Recording: (5250/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it is. 

Recording: (5251/ 10721) 
 You know, okay, this is what I'm doing wrong. Let's not do it again. And then nobody asked me out for a few more years. 

Recording: (5252/ 10721) 
 six years ago. 

Recording: (5253/ 10721) 
 See, I would be all up in the room, too, looking, reading. I would be just like my mother was, even though I hated it. But I would do that. 

Recording: (5254/ 10721) 
 there could still be like a think tank of executives that could be very liberal in their thinking and just you know for social for social  Not so much social change, but not encouraging sweatshops within the corporation, stuff like that. I don't know how I would get involved in something like that, but I would like to.  It'd be interesting. 

Recording: (5255/ 10721) 
 You know, and nobody does the 60 hour work weeks like some people apparently are accustomed to around here. 

Recording: (5256/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5257/ 10721) 
 Who's going to witness this now? There's no one here. 

Recording: (5258/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5259/ 10721) 
 uh... that i have to do something like it's more of a this big procession to do anything you have to put on like all these coats were more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like go to the park and sit and  it's fine, but like here you know you get slush everywhere and you gotta think of something to do. You just can't like drive around and waste time because it's because it's miserable. 

Recording: (5260/ 10721) 
 You're from where? 

Recording: (5261/ 10721) 
 I really don't think we do for the most part. I can't say I see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything.  Do you think our country is ready for a female president?  Although I don't really see too many sexist problems, I definitely do see guys still being 

Recording: (5262/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 Thank you very much.

 these spiral notebooks around and she'd just write in them. And since she passed away in 1979, I have run across  Well, I just finally decided, well, those notebooks are down there, and if I need one for something, I'll just go ahead and use it. And I've run across a couple of them.  a couple of her poems that I didn't know anything about. 

Recording: (5265/ 10721) 
 I don't know. She doesn't move anymore and she has to. I'm the one that loves to exercise.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5267/ 10721) 
 It's a cartoon, I believe it started out.

 OK, dripping down. 

Recording: (5270/ 10721) 
 Hmm 

Recording: (5271/ 10721) 
 There's no concept behind it. You're right. You're right. To some degree, the...  area commissions are supposed to work on that and help unify. I used to be on the university area commission and the campus  That's one of the things we work on, although some of the other commissions in Columbus are almost strictly architectural. 

Recording: (5272/ 10721) 
 So made me squirm a little bit always in my seat. That happened, I was kind of like, I know who he's talking to.  My mother's two sisters married Southern Baptist ministers. 

Recording: (5273/ 10721) 
 I think through education, it's just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe  don't get that at home. So they're really looking to choose the right thing to do. 

Recording: (5274/ 10721) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (5275/ 10721) 
 So I can sleep in. 

Recording: (5276/ 10721) 
 so I don't know, maybe it is a little bit more dangerous. But I think that comes with a bigger city. When you get more people, there's obviously gonna be some more problems.  And I mean that's really that's really all that I noticed it's obviously a lot more build up it's gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (5277/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5278/ 10721) 
 And you learn what you have to to get through the test, of course. I did that when I was here at school. 

Recording: (5279/ 10721) 
 I didn't like his last middle name. 

Recording: (5280/ 10721) 
 and obviously a lot more dangerous. I definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like  college or whatever. 

Recording: (5281/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5282/ 10721) 
 There was a little bit, well quite a bit of it was, yeah. Some of the people in the group didn't play sports, but it wasn't all from one sport or another. It was football.  It was usually the best football players, the best wrestlers. 

Recording: (5283/ 10721) 
 That would just be too scary for me. 

Recording: (5284/ 10721) 
 that did yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he struggled yesterday well let's lower the  this  Hey, time out. Let's get Scooby to our men's. Let's let him out there and shoot. He gets to our men's, try again.

 But it wasn't because it caught fire. And that time, he was burned on the back.

Recording: (5292/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they went and won the Super Bowl and then went back and lost the Super Bowl. 

Recording: (5293/ 10721) 
 That was always too subjective for me. 

Recording: (5294/ 10721) 
 Ugh. 

Recording: (5295/ 10721) 
 I was going to say most of them are. 

Recording: (5296/ 10721) 
 for the rest of my life and so be it. I got a conscience and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there.  You know, that's basically where I've been, you know, I've lived here my whole life. Like I said, I went to college, I played baseball. Due to injuries, you know,  knees and shoulder. I just I was very I was pro caliber you know I played baseball with with Paul O'Neill and 

Recording: (5297/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5298/ 10721) 
 leave the church. I don't go there anymore. The only time I've gone there was for my nephew's baptism and my grandparents funeral. And that's the only time you'll find me in there.  I went to a wedding too, but it's difficult sitting in there because of the way I follow now and actually seeing  things for what they are. 

Recording: (5299/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5300/ 10721) 
 in his own mind. Regardless, it's part of that bad spirit that people have created. Not the devil, not Satan, to the native people he doesn't exist.  And to me, he doesn't exist. He's a piece of shit, but he's real.

 She did, but we were out. 

Recording: (5304/ 10721) 
 And I don't know, I think having the word honors gives some kids enough prestige that they don't totally freak out about not going Ivy League.  you 

Recording: (5305/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha 

Recording: (5306/ 10721) 
 would make any difference or not. 

Recording: (5307/ 10721) 
 not too far from here. 

Recording: (5308/ 10721) 
 Really? I haven't noticed that yet. 

Recording: (5309/ 10721) 
 because it was also a nice like 100 is such a pretty round number. 

Recording: (5310/ 10721) 
 Probably it is, you're right. I asked him what language did he have to learn to get it. 

Recording: (5311/ 10721) 
 Then when I found out there were so many openings in special ed, so and then I found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for LD because  A lot of these LD kids have language deficits and language problems. They can't express themselves on paper or they don't process  things correctly, auditorily, so that's the perfect background to work with LD kids. I didn't know I was doing that at the time. 

Recording: (5312/ 10721) 
 But it's parents that fight for the society and what's in your community. You know the parents for each individual child, they have to all form together.  as a group and almost be a parent to all these kids as a group. You can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school  school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents don't even know where they are. It's the kids' responsibility to get and go to school. Maybe the mom and

 all of that plus by the time you get to first grade you're supposed to have all the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could say them  in order and recognize them. You didn't even have to know how to spell the word or write them down. Now they want you to know the numbers 1 through 100.

 Well, I would say in Springfield, yeah. 

Recording: (5317/ 10721) 
 Well, I think it's more capable of being violent because of the information available to people about bombs and stuff like that, you know, or before, you know, somebody  somebody get mad at somebody, you know, they might shoot them or something, but not kill 100 innocent people for no reason.

 So family, familiarity, and just the community, I think. If you had to name like a family  Crime, I think, is going up.  up and up. Traffic is horrendous. But I mean you need to go through that right now because Columbus is expanding so much that we need that. 

Recording: (5319/ 10721) 
 Yeah, woo. And at the time, I was like, I'm not going to get anything out of this. And it was misery.  What not but I've met people that have been in much worse situations and at least I can kind of relate to them

 Oh yeah, and I'll probably step on your toes here, but I'm not a firm believer of mom and dad both working. My wife worked until we had children, then she stayed home, and once they got  into school, she worked at a school. So when they were gone, she was gone. When they were home, she was home. And my parents didn't do that, and I hated it. I hated coming home from school by myself every day.  day. There was nobody there to talk to, you know, and I did it for years. And I just feel that, you know, I hope you don't have children yet. Do you?

 He just looked up at you like, what are you talking about? He smiles at me when I talk to him. 

Recording: (5330/ 10721) 
 Yeah, so, you know, I felt like, you know,  know, the Polaris Mall would benefit Columbus and all the way around, you know. As far as  You know what was going on with that Jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about North LeMans.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5339/ 10721) 
 and I hate hearing myself on tape too. 

Recording: (5340/ 10721) 
 I, you know, from my perspective, which is skewed, of course, to me, I think it just seems that way. I mean, it was, we're only talking about ten cases, that's not very many, you know, I mean.  You could, by coincidence, have them all be African American. If I were African American, I think I would have a different perspective.  And I don't live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police, so I'm not in touch with it. 

Recording: (5341/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's on Olentangy down there, north of there.

Recording: (5344/ 10721) 
 There generally tends to be at least one or two Republicans I vote for each election. Sometimes I voted straight Democrat because I just, you know, I even voted for Dorothy Teeter the first time she ran for county commissioner.  because I liked her style and I thought she was nice and I liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so I didn't vote for her after that.  But the first time she ran for county commissioner, I did it one because she was a woman and I like, you know, when possible I like to vote for women.

Recording: (5347/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean, I tried and tried. I just see it that he's not changing. And you know, you keep hoping, you just keep hoping. But it's all upon him.  and obviously he doesn't love me enough to really want to change and settle down. He still wants to do those things he's doing and I just need to  move on. 

Recording: (5348/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5349/ 10721)

Recording: (5352/ 10721) 
 Is that the way Jesus Christ would have brought that here? Well, some people have their opinion. I said, no, no. I said, you wear that collar.  you do something about that. If you don't, then I realize what a spineless person you are. But you'll never find me in your church again. So...  I've done what I've done, but there's a lot of people out there that will read a book on Native American spirituality and they'll become self-proclaimed spiritual leaders.

 I plan at this point to pursue history to the PhD level. Anything, of course, can happen.

 Right now, but I knew him when he was eight ten months sober. I work every day 

Recording: (5359/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there was just something about that sting far better, far more than the paddle. Paddle was kind of a whop and then it was ended up with a sting. It kind of got your attention.  Many remember.  I mean, my mother used to say for every law that was written, there is another law written over here that will nullify that.  And actually, as I've grown older, I've found it's worse in today's world. As I said, it's the civil rights movement, and you have a right to this, and you have a right to that.  I think is the most thing that ever was passed. I don't think there should be any more.  And then they'll be, well, but there are people who get murdered in such a electric chair. Electric chair? I still believe in it. Because if someone is proven...  And I don't believe that they should have 10 years of, what do they call that, legal process where they use. 

Recording: (5360/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5361/ 10721)

 gays, homosexuals and all those. 

Recording: (5365/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5366/ 10721) 
 I think it's the right position to take. But like abortion, that's one of the big issues that divide people very quickly.  I think it's moderating somewhat as the gay activists continue their campaigns. But that's one where a candidate has to tread very carefully.  I was proud that Coleman said it and didn't back down on that. They told me a little bit about his character. 

Recording: (5367/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5368/ 10721) 
 Usually whatever ones I can find. You got Columbus Alive and just not quite that. 

Recording: (5369/ 10721) 
 I was living with my mom and half and half, like joint custody or whatever, I was living with my mom and half with my dad and then when my dad moved to Florida I moved with him and then my mom ended up  move getting remarried like my dad had remarried by that time too and I'm remarried and this and they lived moved out to Sunbury and like this house on five acres or whatever and  And so then when I came back, I just lived with her up there. 

Recording: (5370/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5371/ 10721) 
 Usually Clintonville. My mom, she's not a big fan of driving. She doesn't really drive very much, which is good. I've ridden in a car with her one time.  She just would prefer not to and that's okay with us because she's got a driver's license for ID and those types of things. But for the most part, so she kind of stays like Clintonville area.  Yeah. 

Recording: (5372/ 10721) 
 That's okay, too. 

Recording: (5373/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (5374/ 10721)

 Right, right. 

Recording: (5380/ 10721) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (5381/ 10721) 
 Well, I know, but you know, it struck me as funny at the time because that's the way it was worded. 

Recording: (5382/ 10721) 
 Do you want this donor to be this, this, and that? Some people will say that. I feel sorry for those people. And I pray for those people, because prayer is the most powerful thing.  you can have. That's going to get you through. Nothing else, I don't care what challenge you have in front of you, you put in His hands and  and you have enough faith to practice it, it'll come through. It may not come through the way you think you want it to, but somewhere along the line, you're going to say, 

Recording: (5383/ 10721) 
 Like they have this, they have like two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens. And like, could you imagine like?

Recording: (5385/ 10721) 
 since she went back to them. 

Recording: (5386/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5387/ 10721) 
 people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or anything else happens to them. 

Recording: (5388/ 10721) 
 You know. 

Recording: (5389/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5390/ 10721) 
 I mean I think that's the best way to address it. And as far as the homosexual, I think there is kids who say, well maybe I'm gay, I don't know if I'm gay or what. Well, hopefully  And they'll know their true identity eventually. 

Recording: (5391/ 10721)

 Well, my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if I slept at night instead of staying up. 

Recording: (5397/ 10721) 
 I'm really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me that's like I don't want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff I just want to get going and do the rest  to this stuff, so. 

Recording: (5398/ 10721) 
 I had enough friends who said to me, can you make money with computers? And I said, yes, you can make money with computers. And they said, what, could I make money with computers?

Like right now I'm phasing an 8th grader out and into the regular English, but he worked really, really hard and he's very bright and he's still a terrible speller, but he  he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspells something 

Recording: (5402/ 10721) 
 Yeah, much too fast for me. 

Recording: (5403/ 10721)

Disposable. That's a problem we have in our society today because of one thing. We're trying to commute 

Recording: (5411/ 10721) 
 That's a real major question, isn't it? No, I don't think it's too bad.  Well, we could go into the issue of the Columbus Board of Education. What's his name? He is always. 

Recording: (5412/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (5413/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5414/ 10721) 
 most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or whatnot are doing most of the crime. So once they're locked up,  up, yeah it costs more money to house them for life, but they're saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore.  anymore so they don't have to catch them, they don't have to process them, etc. So I would really like to see that. And plus I think once that really

 like it's like we're taking catalog words over the phone it's not really a big deal like they're not seeing how we're dressed at all I mean they tell us which is where college shirts and stuff but nobody does like they don't really enforce it  And they too, they yell at like, Knife, like for hugging or whatever. Like they told us that one day that we couldn't hug. And they were like, no, that's like you can't hug in here or something like that.  They're like, it takes away from the professional attitude. It's like I don't even know what to say to people like that. This is like such a different. 

Recording: (5419/ 10721) 
 But it's necessary for the way I follow. Especially for men. Women have a purification  month.

 you 

Recording: (5434/ 10721) 
 Is this weird? 

Recording: (5435/ 10721) 
 And of course a lot of that hinges on the fact that my son is a student and they're very pro-education. So my son, he's back home now, but I wish he  would go too. He just joined this fraternity. 

Recording: (5436/ 10721) 
 Okay.

Recording: (5441/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I contributed to too many people. There's too many people. There's not enough commitment. It's too easy to get divorced.  The competition, I mean there's just tons and tons of just people everywhere and young people today, I don't know what the statistics are  going to be but I don't think they have a good idea of what marriage even is. And also before marriage was a commitment to

Recording: (5447/ 10721) 
 It's like, sometimes I think about people, you know, they call, and especially when I talk to, sometimes people call in and I talk, you know, I get the same people or whatever.  Once well, especially if like there's people have real specific weird names or something that I can remember They'll call back and I'll think about him. It's like how I have this you know it's like we have this weird  like five minute relationship or something like that, like every couple of weeks or something.

Recording: (5450/ 10721) 
 There's not a big established gallery system and everything, so a lot of things were just available. You could walk in and show anywhere. I met a lot of people  doing that. I mean I'm mainly friends with the same people I met then, artists my age.  I don't belong to any formal groups in Columbus, but it's a real strong network of people.  you 

Recording: (5451/ 10721) 
 You know?

Recording: (5468/ 10721) 
 I'm out. 

Recording: (5469/ 10721) 
 We're not going to make as much money. The people are going to say, gee, I'm not going to them. I'm going to go someplace else. Again, it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in our society. We care less about anybody else.  If I have problems, the government is going to help me out. That's a mindset that's been entrenched for 40 some years. It's a mindset that if you talk to the older generation,  generations are dying off now that said we would never had in our lifetime. It's a rule nation in our country and if you were old enough to remember Khrushchev, I believe Khrushchev is

 the beginning of the end. Yep, I grew up in Upper Arlington. Yeah, really those five miles make such a  a difference though. Yeah, because I live on campus. 

Recording: (5472/ 10721) 
 But then that hurts the administrators in the sense that they're there to provide an education. So it'd be rough.  and like my high school they put up cameras and they locked bathrooms like at certain times you couldn't go in them. It was getting, and they had like, we were on the front page  the 

Recording: (5473/ 10721) 
 I think, I think through education that's, it's just going to only help. 

Recording: (5474/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but I mean, we're not in a depression and the employment rate is fine and health care, we've got some improvements there.  I mean I wouldn't say he's done a horrible job but I think that you just spend so much time focusing  on other things and look at all the money that we wasted where we could have spent that money on something else you know and you end up doing that. 

Recording: (5475/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (5476/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 He was in so much trouble and that was the main reason why I didn't stay with him. He was just draining on me and pulling me down. He was never really there. He was in and  out of jail all the time and I would go through the whole bureau of child support, that whole thing and that was a total mess.  He would have wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff. Well, it turned out he could just move. 

Recording: (5480/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, that's the worst part there. A lot. They could really double. They took, our neighbor is in the sixth grade, and they took a whole  whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade. 

Recording: (5481/ 10721) 
 A couple, three times too, but on the phone and everything. And then I sat there and said, well, you can call me every name in the book, do whatever the heck you want to, but I'm still your father. 

Recording: (5482/ 10721) 
 He was adjusting on us and we couldn't do it, we didn't catch on to where it was right away, but by the time we started looking for our  holes which weren't deep enough, we realized that he was in a clump of cactus.

 I'm like, you know, what hospital is that? You know, what jury? You know? So a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multimillion dollar  lawsuits are is a lie. Even the lady that I mean sued McDonald's for spilling the coffee  on herself because she put it in her crotch with the lid off you know there ought to be a common-sense clause in lawsuits you know her own stupidity

Wait till you get married. You'll, you know, and I don't eat any animals at all. And it was just a conscious decision. 

Recording: (5539/ 10721) 
 Part of it was my fault. I wasn't very good at discipline in the classroom.  That was probably one of the biggest problems I had. 

Recording: (5540/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5541/ 10721) 
 I had my head was that far below the surface.

 It was about a bunch of teenage ravers. 

Recording: (5549/ 10721) 
 I think the teachers are every bit as good as the students.  but I think there seems to be the whole administration up through the board and just it's not as  I don't know how to describe it. It's like the teachers are sort of, it seems like they almost have the feeling they're on their own.  Well, I'm going to go ahead and get started. 

Recording: (5550/ 10721) 
 And I heard the thing, you know, you're not my real father and all that. We went through all that. 

Recording: (5551/ 10721)

Recording: (5553/ 10721) 
 The public transit system, I mean, I know they're doing the best they can, but I don't see how we're ever going to get out of this without  light rail and I'm really bummed.

 you're right on the top. 

Recording: (5555/ 10721) 
 in a fight and they just said that we want to be looked at as just other kids you know in high school but yet when they  makeup and they spike their hair and they have all these piercings. You know, it's like they don't want to be like everybody else. 

Recording: (5556/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5557/ 10721) 
 don't know if that's what percolates. It's very different in the public schools than the Catholic school. In the public school, you have all the problems of society. In the school you have the drugs,  You have the absentee parents, you have the delinquency. On the Catholic school, you don't have that. For one thing, it's oriented around the church, even though we're not Catholic.  It's still oriented that so there's a lot of values that permeates everything. Well, they don't do that in the public school because if you do that, somebody's gonna get ticked off. It's the wrong way.

 kids because a lot of times maybe they don't get that at home. So they're really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that's their avenue to go.  there. 

Recording: (5562/ 10721) 
 stuff like that. I think they might have found one or two guns. That to me was... but my high school is 2,000 people so I guess  by sheer numbers, one or two persons would bring a gun. 

Recording: (5563/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5564/ 10721) 
 I don't know if you really feel like that whole health care thing, which nothing ever happened with, really. And I think these people have a lot of really great ideas, but they  They don't ever really put anything into action, they just kind of skate along.

 yeah i thought it was going to be like not so structured but it really is and like especially i mean it i know it's like all first year classes are basically the same and it's just kind of like how  I don't know. I thought it would be different, like more of an adult type thing when really it's just they treat you the exact same way. Like, I don't know.  Yeah, I think that's true and like I lived in 

Recording: (5570/ 10721) 
 the right person they're talking to. But too many times it's the other way around. 

Recording: (5571/ 10721) 
 I mean, fact of the matter is, if being gay is a genetic disorder, then that should have no effect on  the kids because they should still be normal I guess or whatever you want to say. 

Recording: (5572/ 10721) 
 There's a huge wind tunnel, yeah. 

Recording: (5573/ 10721) 
 to people who don't get along and we look at the problems. It was centered on that. I'm getting off topic. I want to go back to Voyager, what you were saying with the  gender roles. I liked at first having Captain Janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint, but I still think that  the women on the show, particularly Seven of Nine, are used as sex objects.

 So, I don't know, just lucky.

Recording: (5639/ 10721) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (5640/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5641/ 10721) 
 Well, I'll have a, maybe when I'm 100, I'll have that figured out.

Recording: (5643/ 10721) 
 right we will bury you we'll bury you internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have dysfunctional people we are we're dysfunctional families if you ever were  If you work on pastoral care activity, you'll find out that people are so concerned about their families, they fail, they think, because their families are broken up, they've got  single parents here, they got divorced here, they don't know what's going on, they're on drugs. Well, the problem is we never got involved.  Thank you. 

Recording: (5644/ 10721) 
 You were.  You had to go home because mother was ill. 

Recording: (5645/ 10721) 
 I don't think she'd have it any other way. 

Recording: (5646/ 10721) 
 Living in Columbus all my life. My dad's dead. He's been dead for about 25 years. My mom's still alive. She's not in real good health. My wife moved from Columbus to Arizona.  and then she moved back here and we got married. I grew up here. I used to hunt. In fact, as you know, we're Henderson, Olentangy, and Bethel Road. I used to hunt all up and through there. 

Recording: (5647/ 10721) 
 We do that a lot too. 

Recording: (5648/ 10721) 
 They did send home a packet to the parents because I remember being really upset and not wanting my mom to talk with me about it. 

Recording: (5649/ 10721) 
 I have it. 

Recording: (5650/ 10721) 
 another thing we need to teach your kids because John Doe Jane Doe is doing it does not mean that is right have the courage to be yourself and say no  Some people might think you're terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (5651/ 10721) 
 It's saltwater fish. 

Recording: (5652/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I grew up in Columbus. I was born here. I went to OSU for school. I was an undergrad.

 My sister-in-law is one of them. She is just too stupid. 

Recording: (5654/ 10721) 
 just getting himself settled into the community and with his job and everything. My mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while. Most of my early  early childhood memories are from where we lived in Mansfield. It was a real don't talk, don't ask community. I mean, you really didn't know your neighbors  unless you went over and said hi. They never came over. Yeah. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We lived in the suburban area. 

Recording: (5655/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (5656/ 10721) 
 And you know, you have a hard thing there. But then if you teach the teachers that they're not going to be quiet and they're not going to, you know, look at this flattery. 

Recording: (5657/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5658/ 10721) 
 when I got here but I was in one of those you know youth stupid psychopathic relationships shall we say and I kind of needed to disappear and  And we never told him where she had just moved. 

Recording: (5659/ 10721) 
 And for some reason they omitted me then. 

Recording: (5660/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I got a class. 

Recording: (5661/ 10721) 
 say, you know, we want to give you this option, we prefer you don't do this, but if you decide to do it, we want you to be protected. 

Recording: (5662/ 10721) 
 Yeah, probably. 

Recording: (5663/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 I read it.

 vandalism, you're serving jail time and you get pretty badly punished for it. In some cases they'll even chain you up and beat you in public for it.  I think, not to sound too vengeful, but I think if more things went that way, that there would be a much less problem with it.  is

 something you can figure out what it says from the context. So we're in the process of phasing him out so that he won't have to, he's had help I think since he was in kindergarten. That's the other  other thing that's really an enigma about these kids, 90% of the time their IQ is like 115 to 130 and I mean they're very bright but  yet something isn't 

Recording: (5669/ 10721) 
 No, it'd probably be something with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind. 

Recording: (5670/ 10721) 
 It's just a different time now. I mean, I remember one of the things I saw when I was a kid on a newscast, you know, with a Vietnamese guy.  a Viet Cong guy getting his brains blown out on national TV, you know. And that didn't make me good.  I'm gonna do that, you know, so I mean I made me want not want to do it, you know, because my brother was in was in Vietnam. He was in the army 

Recording: (5671/ 10721) 
 Definitely, I'm such a slacker here, it's great. 

Recording: (5672/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, we didn't go to court. 

Recording: (5673/ 10721) 
 mhm 

Recording: (5674/ 10721) 
 So we're talking extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are, how they work. So class one was demystifying the computer. We took it apart, we labeled everything inside, I gave them all a piece, I said put  back to get. We turned it on, we saw if it worked, we went back in, figured out why it didn't work, took it apart again. This wasn't something they can do hardware, because hardware has no money in it.  it was so that they're not scared of the magic box. 

Recording: (5675/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5676/ 10721) 
 We both love sports. We love college football. 

Recording: (5677/ 10721) 
 and the safety of the neighborhood. And there are a few things, really, that go into it. 

Recording: (5678/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5679/ 10721) 
 I don't go to city center too much although I like it being there if I want to go to it. 

Recording: (5680/ 10721) 
 You know, stuff like that's always been around, but it seems now that the guns are more... You can get them easier. Well, it's like me, I could be carrying a gun right now.  What are they going to do to me? 

Recording: (5681/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5682/ 10721) 
 it's better in terms of the city government seems to be the people seem to be more aware of what they're doing and it is not. Oh well I'll just.  do this, it's kind of like, you know, there's some brains down there. 

Recording: (5683/ 10721) 
 being goofy. 

Recording: (5684/ 10721) 
 She was originally from Southern Ohio, but while I was gone she came to Columbus and so I came here when I was discharged.  I served an apprenticeship in a sheet metal worker's shop.  shop work, we did erection work too and commercial work.  you 

Recording: (5685/ 10721) 
 right. 

Recording: (5686/ 10721) 
 We're up there, it's all go, go, go. 

Recording: (5687/ 10721) 
 The more laid back. 

Recording: (5688/ 10721) 
 No, no, they didn't. They didn't pay for grading or preparing your classes or researching anything. So  Right, but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job. I I liked it when I did it I liked the  introduction to the arts class because I had to develop my own curriculum for it. Right. They had a when they told me I 

Recording: (5689/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5690/ 10721) 
 and makes her look good. 

Recording: (5691/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5692/ 10721) 
 and make maybe $10,000 profit. And she would say, well, I don't know. For a long time, she was always real skeptical because I would just make up these numbers or just have this idea.  And finally she says, oh, Rachel, I don't know. It always works out for you. You always get that. So just do it. And it's just some intuition kind of thing. 

Recording: (5693/ 10721) 
 How many I don't know it doesn't matter been in many ones that were too hard for me 

Recording: (5694/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5695/ 10721) 
 And my—but now my daughter's—my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college.  I think that they are, one of them particularly is  I think in good moral, good sort of guy. And the other one I don't feel like I know as well, but 

Recording: (5696/ 10721) 
 around more than somebody else. 

Recording: (5697/ 10721) 
 Harry, yeah, I'm like, oh my God, what did we do? Like my grandmother's name was Olive. When I was born, my dad said, why, she looks just like your mother, to my mom.  And I've turned out to do everything that she did. I've turned out to teach, she was a teacher. I've turned out to be, you know, real good in the kitchen and baking.  Crafts like she did knitting and crocheting and I do that, but I'm sure glad they didn't name me Olive 

Recording: (5698/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you're not alone. 

Recording: (5699/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5700/ 10721) 
 none of the traditional light at the big tunnel with a bright light at the end or they were floating above themselves looking down at the  themselves at the accident scene, seeing a dead relative, something like that. 

Recording: (5701/ 10721) 
 I mean, we would like when he was 14 years old, we wouldn't let him go out and take a walk at three in the morning and he couldn't understand that. I'm sorry. I don't think that's being.  a bad parent to tell you no. 

Recording: (5702/ 10721) 
 Okay. Well, I'm not adopting that role. And fortunately, the judge of our game isn't listening to our conversation, so I feel kind of safe. A mutual friend.  much better friend of mine than of hers, but she's more attractive than I am, so we figured it all balanced out. We decided that made him unbiased. 

Recording: (5703/ 10721) 
 Well, he taught math, but they had a general curriculum. It was just like he taught seventh grade. They gave him math, science, supposedly social  studies and all the stuff that, I mean it was just, it was very poorly run to begin with. So we would go out and try and find books  for the kids. You heard that he hadn't bought them books, so we had to buy them. I mean, they got reimbursed.  Yeah. 

Recording: (5704/ 10721) 
 And then my other sister just recently got divorced this year, or I guess it was finally ended last year.  she's got two kids, raising them. They're all, most of them except for Linda and Bobby. Bobby's the one in Connecticut and Linda's in Akron.  But everybody else is within 10 minutes of each other. 

Recording: (5705/ 10721) 
 And that's what I like about it is the ambience and the river and the apartments are just very, very plain.  But, uh... 

Recording: (5706/ 10721) 
 Oh my. 

Recording: (5707/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (5708/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5709/ 10721) 
 See, I'm not sure if universal health care would be the thing. I think it was my freshman year, my sister and I went to Donasila, the 

Recording: (5710/ 10721) 
 I don't think so. 

Recording: (5711/ 10721) 
 Um, not really, because I think, you know, if, if they're going to, they're going to  to  oh I have a condom I'm going to have sex. I mean actually this is a very hot topic in England right now because they've got the highest 

Recording: (5712/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5713/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5714/ 10721) 
 then you're really going to get out of it what you need to. 

Recording: (5715/ 10721) 
 You can hit the road if you want. Of course, the only thing he had was nothing 

Recording: (5716/ 10721) 
 where it took me to. 

Recording: (5717/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5718/ 10721) 
 the 

Recording: (5719/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well people don't have the priorities that they should. What do you do? You work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die. What did you do  Did you learn anything? Did you teach anyone? Did you have an opinion about anything? That to me, if you don't have time, then you're just floating along.  I'm trying to take it up space now. 

Recording: (5720/ 10721) 
 Not much. 

Recording: (5721/ 10721) 
 I think in Spanish here they had two murders over there and it was publicized in the Columbus area. 

Recording: (5722/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5723/ 10721) 
 And that's what we did. And so he's just like my own too now. I go and volunteer. He's in kindergarten. I go and volunteer in his classroom too. So it's kind of like, I hope I get to do this forever. 

Recording: (5724/ 10721) 
 I'm sure you guys took those classes. They're horrible. They take 17 hours of labor. They put it into six minutes and you think, oh my God, I'm going to die.  You know these women are like, I just want to die. You know, and you're like, why are you showing me this? 

Recording: (5725/ 10721) 
 and I've always felt good about it, but people always said, oh, you don't even crave a Wendy's hamburger and all this stuff. And once you make a decision like that, you don't  People crave things like that. You don't even think about it. 

Recording: (5726/ 10721) 
 Yeah, Hoosier. Yeah, so things pretty much in Columbus Public Schools,  They don't actually sit down with you. They automatically assume that once you get to this level, you're ready for this level and you go on. 

Recording: (5727/ 10721) 
 Ugh. 

Recording: (5728/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (5729/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5730/ 10721) 
 She's grown, she's expanded her horizons, if you will. 

Recording: (5731/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5732/ 10721) 
 I made a difference. 

Recording: (5733/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5734/ 10721) 
 She wants to go to Columbus State. Wants to get into one of their engineering tech programs.  And I hope she does. She never failed.  She's mature in many ways, but she's had to be responsible for herself her whole life. 

Recording: (5735/ 10721) 
 years in high school, two years after high school to pay my way through college. I taught school for about eight and a half, nine years and during that time got my master's degree in remedial reading.  I taught for, I think I said this, about 8 1⁄2, 9 years and my life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teacher's association or teacher's union.  and that led to a job in political action because I'd always been active in politics from high school on. The first campaign I worked in was for John Kennedy in 1960. 

Recording: (5736/ 10721) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (5737/ 10721) 
 in a heartbeat try and help them. But I don't think they make an effort to put out any, you know, 

Recording: (5738/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5739/ 10721) 
 They have a very nice standard of living, all of them do. 

Recording: (5740/ 10721) 
 and so they offered to move them back. 

Recording: (5741/ 10721) 
 of a murderer. 

Recording: (5742/ 10721) 
 That's about right. That's about right. I think it's intro vitriol. Intro vitriol. That's all there is.  you 

Recording: (5743/ 10721) 
 And it was pretty. It was fun to be the first class in the school because everything's brand new. 

Recording: (5744/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5745/ 10721) 
 Which one's that? 

Recording: (5746/ 10721) 
 Oh you have? It's like, man, after I heard that I said, that's not even worth calling, I said, they're gonna be rude. 

Recording: (5747/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5748/ 10721) 
 But I had a note in before I had the heart attack. I'd already had two heart attacks. I had a note in it. I needed to be on first shift or I'd probably have another heart attack. And they went out  put me on first shift. Then I had another heart attack. Put me in the hospital. Then I had another heart attack when I was in the hospital. And when I came out, that's when I gave them another note stating  and I needed to really be on first shift. 

Recording: (5749/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5750/ 10721) 
 was five. 

Recording: (5751/ 10721) 
喂 

Recording: (5752/ 10721) 
 up to us what we wanted to do. We were, we'd get up, leave at 930, be home by 930 or whenever it got dark. 

Recording: (5753/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (5754/ 10721) 
 Just a teeny bit. 

Recording: (5755/ 10721) 
 He was a railroad clerk. 

Recording: (5756/ 10721) 
 sexuality and all 

Recording: (5757/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5758/ 10721) 
 Once it was filed, the judge scheduled a hearing. And for whatever stupid reason, the soonest they could hear the case was one year.  from the date we filed. So you can see when you get in the bed with you know and involved in the  legal system in terms of filing a multi-million dollar lawsuit or whatever, any kind of lawsuit. 

Recording: (5759/ 10721) 
 Good, my son. 

Recording: (5760/ 10721) 
 Yes, to some degree they should, but there we go again. It's just like the people when I worked in bars. They'd always want to hold the bartender responsible. But say you could come up, I'd give you a beer and you could give it to me.  somebody else. 

Recording: (5761/ 10721) 
 and then I'm probably going to be working on my portfolio the second term. 

Recording: (5762/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5763/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I loved 161. I loved it around there. I loved all those cool restaurants and everything. 

Recording: (5764/ 10721) 
 When you think that our major resource is our children and our offspring, then we better not, you know. 

Recording: (5765/ 10721) 
 anyway. And I'm not saying in general, but with the experiences that I've had, certain families where they don't, socioeconomically, just not as well off.  you 

Recording: (5766/ 10721) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (5767/ 10721) 
 and  larger story between now and the end of episode 3 is like the Republic falls and the Empire takes over and all  the Jedi are killed by this cute little eight-year-old kid. 

Recording: (5768/ 10721) 
 I like seeing them grow up together. 

Recording: (5769/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, I think she really kind of knows that from conversations with me and stuff while she was growing up. You know, my values and stuff.  basically are more religious oriented, you know, than I would say my wives, but  So I think she knows what I value as being important, what I value as being not important. 

Recording: (5770/ 10721) 
 And, oh, they saw the ragged end of the war. 

Recording: (5771/ 10721) 
 understanding. 

Recording: (5772/ 10721) 
 My boyfriend would love to mess with this. I just want you to know that he'd be like, ee, ee, ee, taking it apart, putting it back together. 

Recording: (5773/ 10721) 
 is the hard drive, the CD-ROM, the 3.5, the 128MB RAM chip, and the USB-C.  the CPU. It's the only thing that's factory anymore. No, they probably wouldn't.  I don't know. I don't know. I'm a really good 

Recording: (5774/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it ain't gonna change that. 

Recording: (5775/ 10721) 
 but it fixed it. 

Recording: (5776/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5777/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5778/ 10721) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (5779/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (5780/ 10721) 
 And I was 39. 

Recording: (5781/ 10721) 
 Yeah, she did that yesterday. 

Recording: (5782/ 10721) 
 Clinton's position on it? Well, he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hoped that it would drop. I mean, what you hear and read lately  is that it really hasn't changed much. But again, I think part of that, too, is society's not ready at some level to accept that.  that. And gays in the military is one thing, but then people are talking about gay marriages 

Recording: (5783/ 10721) 
 The lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw in her mouth and couldn't breathe and breathed in all the sand and died.  first thing they put in the paper is that another Native ceremony shows us how Native American spirituality should be outlawed. And if you look at any kind of  spirituality, religion that's out there. Native Americans are the only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can't have. That there's blood quantums 

Recording: (5784/ 10721) 
 I mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where I mean I can't say there's anything really different. 

Recording: (5785/ 10721) 
 that it shouldn't be. On the other hand, I'd hate to see a 13-year-old have a baby because she was afraid  you 

Recording: (5786/ 10721) 
 People would knock on the door and they would yell that they weren't home or something. 

Recording: (5787/ 10721) 
 And I just told them what it has to do with my belief system, so you're in violation of the First Amendment. And then they realized that I wasn't stupid.  So, you know, they just made things more and more difficult for me. So I just decided to, since they weren't going to change, I was just going to leave.  So, it's a hard way to choose to walk if you're an idealistic person. 

Recording: (5788/ 10721) 
 London, Paris, Prague, Budapest, Amsterdam, Venice, Vienna, Berlin, Munich. There's probably some more on there, but that's all the ones that jump off. There's like a little hit list in my head, obviously.  another hit list in my Palm Pilot and life is good. 

Recording: (5789/ 10721) 
 You alright? 

Recording: (5790/ 10721) 
 Yes and no. I mean, we have high schoolers in there. There's no requirements for what school you go to, but we get our internet service.  partially through Ohio State. And the vast majority of college students go here. 

Recording: (5791/ 10721) 
 I'd like to seen it pass just for the fact to see what the hell they would have done with the money but I don't blame people for voting for the one not vote for the other because you're talking about something  I had an engineering, a civil engineering friend years ago and I worked at Axon Chemicals which is over in Dublin and I lived over where I'm living now.  Every year they were doing work on 270, you know, so I'd get pissed off and be bitching at him about it and everything, you know, and he'd go, you don't realize, you know, by the time we get 

Recording: (5792/ 10721) 
 and call her Tammy when she's little. 

Recording: (5793/ 10721) 
 Actually, I live at Riverwatch Towers on Lane Avenue. Much nicer than the dorms. Oh, no, it's like right across the street.  Oh yeah. I got like two roommates. I highly recommend the roommate thing.  I guess it's kind of like a hostile environment. 

Recording: (5794/ 10721) 
 Oh, you do know? 

Recording: (5795/ 10721) 
 She's so bright. I mean, she really is. I think it's one of those things where she just doesn't turn in her stuff, you know? And she's 12. 

Recording: (5796/ 10721) 
 So am I. I missed your question before that. 

Recording: (5797/ 10721) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (5798/ 10721) 
 a baby, a biracial baby, which worked out. Jesse's the sweetest kid in the whole world. And my mom's friend Collin's a teacher, and she watched  Jessie for a good three years during the day. I mean, I'll call him hater, obviously. But, I mean, she really enjoyed that.

 Or they didn't say loud enough that you had the right to. Well I was never told I had the right. I never was told I could make the phone call. And if they can convince them and the  poor policeman can't, I think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything that's said and taping it so it's so clear that there's no way that they can deny it. And then yet  got that thing allowed. It's illegal. Civil rights. You can't take what I'm saying. It's like we signed the paper for you. Then get them to sign when they go in there.

 Growing up my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs and so I was always interested in the food industry but more so with  planning of the parties and deciding what the clients needs are. I really like working in that aspect with nice chefs and really creative food.  It's nice because basically every job is usually different. I'm doing a function tonight for 300 people. 

Recording: (5862/ 10721) 
 Of course, the multiple choice, there's a right or wrong answer.

 There were people I met through friends. Actually, one of my friend's parents had a friend that was gay.  and just be over there or whatever. I mean, I can't say there's any big difference between. 

Recording: (5864/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5865/ 10721) 
 But what does it tell us about our people? We're so naive. We've got to look inside ourselves and say, what can we bring to society that could be more  beneficial and most of the time it's listening. 

Recording: (5866/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it is. What I can't understand is some people live in Upper Arlington and they send their kids to private school.

 mass communication to everybody with interpersonal communications. That's the key in my opinion. Personal versus interpersonal communication.  and it's zero over here and we're almost a hundred percent over here, but when we're in this interpersonal or global or massive, whichever term is the most appropriate,  John Doe who speaks here, he hasn't the faintest idea who Jane Doe is over here. 

Recording: (5873/ 10721) 
 it's gotten to the point where there's more than five million outside.

 And I think, of course, we would all hope that abortion wouldn't be, that nobody would have an abortion. That would be the perfect world.  nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one. But I also think, you know, I mean, yeah, there shouldn't be, there shouldn't  shouldn't spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you're pregnant. But I think the subject has to be mentioned just in passing.

I think you should name a kid, something that will fit him at 83  and eight and in between, like we named our son Robert. When he was little he was Robbie, now he's eighteen he's Rob. When he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can  be Robert, Paul, you know, and in kindergarten all I had to learn to write was ROB or ROBBY.

 so me, I don't, like I said, I don't try and dwell on the negative, you know, but it's very easy to get sucked into what's wrong out there.  And it's also very easy to get sucked into the attitude. Well, I'm gonna change this You know if you can you do what you can do  as a human being. That alone is good enough. 

Recording: (5889/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (5890/ 10721) 
 all those things that I've mentioned before, but I think that really it goes back to that. What can we do to change it? I think as I said, basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person  and what's good for everybody, not just me, me, me. 

Recording: (5891/ 10721) 
 I don't think it's necessarily that. I think it comes back to the lack of self-discipline. 

Recording: (5892/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5893/ 10721) 
 Ha! 

Recording: (5894/ 10721)

And they made it very clear to me that they knew the program and I didn't. 

Recording: (5952/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (5953/ 10721) 
 The women really don't need the sweat lodge, but it's there for them and they do participate. 

Recording: (5954/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5955/ 10721) 
 I know. 

Recording: (5956/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5957/ 10721) 
 And then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh, well, you know, you got to look at that You got to be more aware 

Recording: (5958/ 10721) 
 My daughter's a schoolteacher, has been teaching for, I don't know, ever since she got her degree. 

Recording: (5959/ 10721) 
 We usually use the word earlier in your statement, what we should buy. 

Recording: (5960/ 10721) 
 I like him personally and when he was running for mayor I would have voted for him. I met him and everything, but I guess he just plays the devil's advocate all the time.  at the school board meetings. I heard this is just a rumor. You want gossip in here. 

Recording: (5961/ 10721) 
 We feel we're better off leaving them there. 

Recording: (5962/ 10721) 
 Yeah, not me, it's too expensive. 

Recording: (5963/ 10721) 
 Well, generally they have some area. I don't think I've ever met the kid yet, the special kid, who has no area.  that he doesn't excel in. Like once I had a sixth grade girl who still didn't know her timetables in sixth grade, but she had a Beverly Sills opera voice.  and in every single school production, she was the lead singer. I had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level. It seems like when God takes away 

Recording: (5964/ 10721) 
 kids. 

Recording: (5965/ 10721) 
 I'm sure, yeah. I mean, he doesn't throw women in her face, no women call the house or anything. You never know what, she doesn't, you know, question him about where he's been or anything like that.  I just can't believe that. I just think that's terrible. 

Recording: (5966/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5967/ 10721) 
 definitely and it really makes you aware of your own mortality. I mean things you see every day. I mean you never know it could happen to anybody anytime just like that accident yesterday with um  Right. 

Recording: (5968/ 10721) 
 Oh, it was nice, actually. I ate a lot more healthy and it was cheaper. I was getting money on my BuckID. So I actually got paid.  heat every day. 

Recording: (5969/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5970/ 10721) 
 That's funny. 

Recording: (5971/ 10721) 
 We have fun. 

Recording: (5972/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5973/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly. So, you know, once you get to a certain degree of frustration,  and you need to relieve that somehow. So that's pretty much why we moved. 

Recording: (5974/ 10721) 
 You know? So I think maybe not universal health care, but for children I think it would be helpful. 

Recording: (5975/ 10721) 
 because we want to be because it's a privilege not because oh my god I go to another play you know my daughter just did a play downtown with Columbus Junior Theatre and I  I could be in the audience every time.  to have no interest in seeing play baseball or swims for Ohio Wesleyan you know or apply they they wouldn't they don't even want to be 

Recording: (5976/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5977/ 10721) 
 So what kind of example is he setting for everybody else? 

Recording: (5978/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (5979/ 10721) 
 So I don't know whether they did any damage or not. 

Recording: (5980/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5981/ 10721) 
 know. 

Recording: (5982/ 10721) 
 Well, quarterback's got an injury to his hand. I mean, he still does good. He just needs to focus in on who he's throwing at instead of throwing at 50 miles.  down the road. He's done that a couple times yesterday and watching out who he's throwing to.  Might help too. 

Recording: (5983/ 10721) 
 You know, so it's, you know, if you have a problem, if you want to talk to somebody, well, if somebody you know personally doesn't, they know somebody. 

Recording: (5984/ 10721) 
 But most of the time it's not bad. So there's that. It's an opportunity for the  musicians in the college to play in an orchestra and what else do they get out of it? I don't know. Prestige, I suppose.  Yeah. 

Recording: (5985/ 10721) 
 And as a result, like their kids my age and stuff like that that I've talked to, I mean, they have no idea what's going on. 

Recording: (5986/ 10721) 
 Yeah, those are nice. 

Recording: (5987/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5988/ 10721) 
 Downtown abandoned warehouses that get rented out for a night. 

Recording: (5989/ 10721) 
 you know, just experiencing someone for who they are. And so she's 

Recording: (5990/ 10721) 
 And as with a lot of the resentment that's felt that I experienced toward Americans,  So rather saddeningly, I think our culture is starting to really infuse itself into Europe,  I mean, I see instead of us becoming more like them, you know, them becoming more like us. Walmart has bought, you know, a big retailer there, so. 

Recording: (5991/ 10721) 
 And nobody's worth that, you know? So that's what I'm saying. It's so retarded. I don't mean to use that word in a bad way, but it's ridiculous.  put it in that way, but that's a better word, that people have to throw out a case that they may have  a legitimate case because they can't afford the legal help. So I think that's wrong in this country. The land of the free and the home of the brave. Yeah, right. 

Recording: (5992/ 10721) 
 Sometimes people just go on and on about things like I got a or like they have like some like insane problem like I don't know why they're sharing it with me like  You know like I had to get this you know I had to get this chair cuz my brother-in-law He sat on it and broke it man. I got in a fight with him about that. He had his wife involved  a lot going on about it it's like like uh... his wife is a bitch or something i don't know i don't know what they expect me to say 

Recording: (5993/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5994/ 10721) 
 They're about two hours west of Omaha. So it's different for them. 

Recording: (5995/ 10721) 
 Yeah, she went down to Western Missouri. 

Recording: (5996/ 10721) 
 Right, right. There I studied music and chemistry and ended up with a double major, bachelor's degree there.  Not doing really the same time. 

Recording: (5997/ 10721) 
 I know another thing about the kids nowadays is, and Devin experienced it with her, I sent her $100 one time just for her and she sat there and said,  I called her up a couple days later, or about a week later or something like that. I said, what'd you do with that, what'd you get with that money and everything? She said, well, you know, I bought a Gap t-shirt and I,  CD and I said, mm-hmm. She goes, what do you mean? That's what I bought. I said, you bought a CD and a blouse? 

Recording: (5998/ 10721) 
 So when we got married, we were together a year, we were engaged a year, and we knew as soon as he finished school, within three months, we got married, bought a house, was pregnant  with Megan. 

Recording: (5999/ 10721) 
 I tried to wait, I guess a couple weeks I'll be having another. 

Recording: (6000/ 10721) 
 I like it a lot. It's changed a lot since I've been here. It's really come a long way in terms of the  the amenities of civilization. You know, restaurants and museums and we get all the good movies now and the Wexner Center has been a big boost. So there's, you know, it's a whole different  town than it was when I first came here. But it's still relatively cheap and it's easy to get around and it's got a lot going for it. 

Recording: (6001/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6002/ 10721) 
 I think that with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing, I think people are starting to look at it a little differently. 

Recording: (6003/ 10721) 
 and it makes you a better person because you got the spirituality inside you driving you and that's what's going to take you home.  I often ask the people, you asked me about marketing. 

Recording: (6004/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6005/ 10721) 
 But she was never interested in boys or in sports in high school or makeup and clothes and things like that.  yourself up for ridicule in high school for that. And that's what happened. She'd come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff. And finally she just stopped going. And within a couple months she got  got her GED. 

Recording: (6006/ 10721) 
 I've always been into art. In high school I went to art, like a ball.  I was for fine arts and I've always wanted to do art because I can't do anything else. No, no, it's mostly  I'm not good at math. I could probably major in English or something like that, but not math.  감사합니다. 

Recording: (6007/ 10721) 
 That's where we need to correct. 

Recording: (6008/ 10721) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (6009/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's just so funny, you know. I know we talk too long, but this is so much fun. 

Recording: (6010/ 10721) 
 Not an immediate family going back like you did there. I know there's a murderer in our family. There have been horse thieves.  I'm going on back now. I'm not thinking in terms of the current family, but basically what I was talking about a while ago is current families. Somewhat current. 

Recording: (6011/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (6012/ 10721) 
 It's all documented. 

Recording: (6013/ 10721) 
 Or you're just gonna go back because you don't know any other way at the time. 

Recording: (6014/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they have a deal on Monday and Tuesday. I think it's like after 5 p.m. 

Recording: (6015/ 10721) 
 And a lot of times unions, they actually seem detrimental to production and to the actual individual needs of the members of the union.  Because if a union becomes powerful, you can feel free to call off and things like that. That can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees  a lazy union as a representative of these workers so they're more apt to go outside. 

Recording: (6016/ 10721) 
 But she was great. I mean, we didn't, I didn't think that then. I don't know why, but she was very manly, but she was very, she was very good, but she was, you know, just not feminine at all. 

Recording: (6017/ 10721) 
 Right, right. Well, let me ask you about somebody else who's not that well known. Do you know John Gorka? Have you heard of him? He's really worth looking into.  He's funny, he has good songs. He's a folk singer really, along the lines of maybe Arlo Guthrie or somebody. I mean he does electric stuff.  sometimes, but he also does acoustic and he writes most of his own songs. Yeah, and if you ever see something by him, you should get it. 

Recording: (6018/ 10721) 
 You can't 

Recording: (6019/ 10721) 
 Well, we use. 

Recording: (6020/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6021/ 10721) 
 and wife out working and making incomes as everyone in the United States today feels they must.  hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about need versus luxuries. I want, I want, I want. Well, I  My judgment is that we're spending today probably 80% of the income on things that they 

Recording: (6022/ 10721) 
 went to Worthington High School and in the end of my third year it became Worthington-Kilbourne High School and Thomas Worthington High School. 

Recording: (6023/ 10721) 
 I think that it would have been better for me if we had lived in New York. 

Recording: (6024/ 10721) 
 Why do I think that is? 

Recording: (6025/ 10721) 
 enough to satisfy me. So that was good. 

Recording: (6026/ 10721) 
 I was in 78. And then I've just, I have stayed there and it's grown a lot and the work chain  It's an interesting place to work because, well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening.  stay out in front of what library innovations, in front of web and net innovations and try to incorporate it all. 

Recording: (6027/ 10721) 
 yeah um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time i just went and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i didn't go like under their insurance or on the same floor  I just kind of met up with them. 

Recording: (6028/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (6029/ 10721) 
 the government. It's whoever wants to be. 

Recording: (6030/ 10721) 
 at the age of 10. 

Recording: (6031/ 10721) 
 She's in my class. 

Recording: (6032/ 10721) 
 So anyway, we had a fine field day that one day, firing at them. The next morning, about 10 o'clock,  We heard a shell coming in and it was an air burst back of us about 500 yards. 

Recording: (6033/ 10721) 
 I do not like busing. I just don't. I think it's kind of like you get what you pay for. 

Recording: (6034/ 10721) 
 if they're over 40, because their company is giving money back to the community for this and that. That's how they're trying to show that they care about this.  mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the downtrodden or you know, but you're right, I think it's terrible.  that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do, better science skills than we do, better language skills than we do. 

Recording: (6035/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (6036/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6037/ 10721) 
 No, I don't fear none of the kids. 

Recording: (6038/ 10721) 
 Or I got to drive further north. So there's not any really good businesses right around where I live. That's the only thing.  So I think they need to come in you know get the downtown going. When I was a kid I loved to go downtown. 

Recording: (6039/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6040/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well like I played music and stuff with a lot of my friends. I don't know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around watching TV and like I don't know just running around everywhere  whatever, but like, in high school it was always just real like, you know, you put in a tiny little bit of effort and you get a B and that's it.  That's good enough I guess. 

Recording: (6041/ 10721) 
 by the politicians, by all the people that have been put in charge to protect people, to protect ideals, to protect principles, throw it out the window for money.  And then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt, it got down to just a dollars and cents bartering for  what my life was worth. And it's the bidding started at $125,000. Now I feel I'm worth more than that. 

Recording: (6042/ 10721) 
 Well... 

Recording: (6043/ 10721) 
 And we met, I was working at a restaurant in Short North, and they were having a Christmas party and his brother worked there. And he brought my husband and I went there and that's how we met.  I'm not a... 

Recording: (6044/ 10721) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (6045/ 10721) 
 Yeah, drugs, right. Yeah, so that's what she's interested in right now. She's looking to see if she can find some place to work this summer.  even if it's just a day a week, some clinic or something, just to see what goes on day to day. 

Recording: (6046/ 10721) 
 I mean, if we were that racist of a city, then we wouldn't be that accepting to gay pride marches and the blackout that we had on campus a few weeks back.  you 

Recording: (6047/ 10721) 
 So the way the university here is run, I can't agree with most of the stuff they do. 

Recording: (6048/ 10721) 
 College-wise I don't know anyone of college age that's gay 

Recording: (6049/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean, I didn't have back problems or anything like that, but it was just like the feeling, it was like I'm not right. 

Recording: (6050/ 10721) 
 Under the conditions that had to prevail, I was treated well enough. 

Recording: (6051/ 10721) 
 Yeah, so, mm-hmm, right. 

Recording: (6052/ 10721) 
 Great. 

Recording: (6053/ 10721) 
 I'm the one that's eventually going to get in trouble. 

Recording: (6054/ 10721) 
 We just started reselling. 

Recording: (6055/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6056/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (6057/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6058/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I think, I'm a firm believer that little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than looking in the mirror and going, look at them hips. And you go,  this way and you go, I'm getting a gut. And you know, it's like, that's so negative to yourself. Would you tell your mom that? You know? 

Recording: (6059/ 10721) 
 Well, we believe that that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again through Joseph Smith because  He had a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw God and Jesus Christ.  know this is all really I mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but and and he was told that there were no none of the churches on the earth were 

Recording: (6060/ 10721) 
 I wish they could. 

Recording: (6061/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (6062/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (6063/ 10721) 
 Not really, I mean, yeah, there's some little flaws, but. 

Recording: (6064/ 10721) 
 I don't know. For a while we got it stopped. The thing that is confusing to me is that sometimes  Sometimes we'll get something stopped for 25 or 30 years or 10 or 15 and then we go back. It's like, hey, we got moved ourselves out of that.  going back to it now. And I think, you know, the papers keep saying that our crime rate is going down and 

Recording: (6065/ 10721) 
 So he did, he went out there and threw some gasoline on it, not knowing that one of the other KPs had been there ahead.  hit of him and thrown gasoline on it. So there was, I don't know how much gasoline on it. When he threw a match on it, 

Recording: (6066/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (6067/ 10721) 
 Well, not really much of the answering the phones and stuff. It was more of my employees that I worked with. It was just  So pretty much I worked with adults that act like we were in high school and it was groupie, you know. And I'm not like that. I try to get along with everybody.  And it was just, I never ended up fitting in with everybody and just things were gossip and I don't go for that. And I ended up quitting that job and I felt like 

Recording: (6068/ 10721) 
 Okay, I thought well what you guys like some 

Recording: (6069/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (6070/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (6071/ 10721) 
 Well, it's not just in the schools, it's in society. I mean, violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things.  It's hard to imagine that there's an easy fix or if there is a fix. It's kind of frustrating because you can't point to one thing.  thing and say this is what needs to be fixed. Again, it's pervasive. It's like the, I don't know if you heard about this in the news, a woman, two women were having an argument, 

Recording: (6072/ 10721) 
 Not that I know of. None of the other sports teams were so inclined to, like, push their athletes to cut weight. 

Recording: (6073/ 10721) 
 That movie was good. Makes you think. Like right now I'm cold. When you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. Like coldness. 

Recording: (6074/ 10721) 
 It is a couple miles 

Recording: (6075/ 10721) 
 Oh no, and it turns out it was the faceless aliens set a trap for the guys and I didn't like the way  it was resolved, but I like the fact that it wasn't resolved the way that they set it up. So I think that, I mean, we supposedly know about Samantha. 

Recording: (6076/ 10721) 
 I think their coach is the best, Joe Paterno is the best. 

Recording: (6077/ 10721) 
 said to me, that can't be wrong because the computer said that was a word. I said, that is a word. Come with me. I'll show you what a vestibule is. 

Recording: (6078/ 10721) 
 Yeah, just ridiculous amounts of stuff. I'm like, I don't want to do that. 

Recording: (6079/ 10721) 
 Right, and just going over it and over it and over it. 

Recording: (6080/ 10721) 
 Not necessarily, but you know, I'd like him to be the candidate. 

Recording: (6081/ 10721) 
 It's like each neighborhood's got a little different personality. 

Recording: (6082/ 10721) 
 That's what you better have. 

Recording: (6083/ 10721) 
 we want to clean or anything, they would probably say, you know, they might think it was kind of weird, but they would let you, you know, but they would be like, you want to do this and we don't have any  money to pay you. Oh, but we don't, you know, we don't want money. That's the whole point. 

Recording: (6084/ 10721) 
 My wife was a very conscientious, hardworking woman. She established a secretary.  business there at our home for several years, and anything that went out of there was right.  I mean, and she did quite a lot of typing for students over here, graduate students. 

Recording: (6085/ 10721) 
 Oh, that was the Monica Lewinsky. 

Recording: (6086/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, she's been known to do that too. 

Recording: (6087/ 10721) 
 No, that's... 

Recording: (6088/ 10721) 
 I think they're doing different things, like different people in the program. But I kind of decided to take the easy route. 

Recording: (6089/ 10721) 
 it's an example. In school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics. I couldn't even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and I took geometry and algebra. You'd think, and I  these straight A's in algebra. When I got to jump, I thought, why am I taking this? So that wasn't so good. But still, the way they were teaching it now, and they're teaching it entirely different now.  And I think Linda explained how they were doing it with Matthew and said she couldn't even help him. So you know, it's in the same way with politics. 

Recording: (6090/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6091/ 10721) 
 ancestors from or whatever, and then you would tell them, and then, you know, on the same turn they would just sort of like sneak in and be like, oh, you're not whatever of this European thing, you're, you know.  I was sort of. 

Recording: (6092/ 10721) 
 and where my mom was a young high school student, just graduating from high school.  They got together there, moved to California. 

Recording: (6093/ 10721) 
 He's got this thing like 30% sales tax and no other tax at all. 

Recording: (6094/ 10721) 
 Oh, you get your choice, Canada. Well, that's... 

Recording: (6095/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that could really bite you in the back though, winning all that money. I'd be quite content with $1 million, but $10  $10 million is kind of like an overkill. I mean, do you think anybody in this town has $10 million? Well, maybe a couple people, yeah. 

Recording: (6096/ 10721) 
 Yeah, when I first went to Oberlin, I was a performance major in French horn. And looking back on it, I wish I had maybe thought to major in music education.  or at least have a little bit of background in that, because I'm thinking it would have given me a little more dimension.  in terms of my teaching possibilities. Although I'm certified to teach now in chemistry and 

Recording: (6097/ 10721) 
 So we're kind of doing that and then I figure I'm probably going to wait tables at night and finish going to school during the day. 

Recording: (6098/ 10721) 
 Because that's like me, I watch the Three Stooges and you don't see me putting no crowbar up nobody's nose. 

Recording: (6099/ 10721) 
 now I am have very little contact with them and so that the last thing I think okay where are we 

Recording: (6100/ 10721)

You know, I was 21.  I start to feel like this response with 25 should not be an adult you know and I wonder at what point do you really feel like you're you are on that other side or you're one of the grown-up people  instead of one of the little people and maybe that's when.

 The parents have so much responsibility, but the kid has so much responsibility, and then society has so much responsibility. So, you know what I mean? Basically, all I've ever seen is...  Well, like these kids that get in the house, they go to their house, they find a gun, and they want to hold the parents responsible. Yes and no on that. If the parents had the gun,  the house and they had the ammunition locked up, say, in the trunk of their car. What if the kid brought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun? 

Recording: (6173/ 10721) 
 He told them, and they said, well, yes, you are. He said, what are you going to do, send me back over to Vietnam? But they sent him home.  But he was, he was not a very enthusiastic soldier, I don't think, at any time, and especially  especially after he came home.

 I think the society in general is declining in a lot of ways. Our morals are declining and our intelligence levels are declining.  Maybe not level, I mean IQs are still high, but people are settling for less. I have a big sign in my room that says, never settle for less than you're very big.  best. Because I really think people are getting lazy. Even adults. We don't even want to wait 25 seconds for microwave popcorn.

 That's one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was we were shopping for school systems just as much you know So and I don't want to buy a house, and I don't want to have  to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system. It seems like since we've bought our house, the houses are just doubling and tripling in value.  Yeah, I don't know, ours has increased quite a lot since we've been there, but we've been there, I guess, about 10 years. 

Recording: (6293/ 10721) 
 I've been in the same house for 17 years.

 Mhm. 

Recording: (6299/ 10721) 
 Because they have enough money to buy new things and they don't want to necessarily send it down, I don't think, to the Salvation Army or the... I don't know.  I think that they think that there's a better way of giving away and like Goodwill they resell and Salvation Army they resell. 

Recording: (6300/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean I know so many people who, you know, when they get pregnant get so, are so conscientious about what they eat and I mean they won't  take antihistamines in hay fever season and so many things that they won't do and they're so conscientious about it. It's hard for me. I mean, I just don't know anybody who  who smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that. On the other hand, I think it's a choice. 

Recording: (6301/ 10721) 
 I'm glad I interrupted your dinner. Fine. Some people would be really nice, and other people would just be unbelievably rude. It was so funny.

 Well maybe it's crime is going down in the sense that it's applying, you know, it's criminals aren't as active, but there's more and more of these acts of violence.  Maybe it's because they're so dramatic. Did you notice it?

 Well they are now in a sense. It's easier to go somewhere else I think in the web. On TV if you have, you know, like...  Four local news channels and they're all saying the same thing and emphasizing the same things. There's no choice there if you want the news. You're going to get it one way or the other.  or the other, but on the web you can go somewhere else. And you know, major newspapers are all over the web.  Bye.

 No.

 Right, yeah. I've run into just a few problems at Antrim. Since I do like to jog, even though I'm very slow, most of the people that take their dogs  there take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and whatnot which is okay you're not supposed to do that but when I'm jogging with my dog on a leash and all the other dogs come up  It irritates me.

One of the diagnoses is probably ADHD, which he has trouble with working memory on how to get a project  done and stuff like that. We taught him how to do timelines and Gantt charts and things like that.

 Kinda, he's kinda, you know, stumble foot still, you know. One and then, you know.

 I'm very proud of the way her and her sister are, but I just think it's because mom was home and there was somebody there to listen to them. And it doesn't have to be mom.  Mom can go work and dad can stay home. There's nothing wrong with that either, but I just think they need mom or dad there every day when they come home so they know when they come home and they've had a really bad day and some  something's really bothering them, they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it's like, well, how's school? 

Recording: (6347/ 10721) 
 Yeah, one is still in high school and she's ready to, she wants to go on to college. So she's pretty much ready to go. I mean she's got one more year of high  school but and I held her back in kindergarten so she's an older graduate she'll be 19 when she graduates and then on the other hand graduated when she was  17. So, then my youngest daughter, Amy, she is, she's doing real well. I mean, she's getting really good grades, A's

 Really? 

Recording: (6354/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think they'll be very helpful. I was going to OSU to deliver the baby so I decided to take the classes there and basically my mom had reminded  me over and over again, so I called OSU and I scheduled on.

 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (6356/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6357/ 10721) 
 Actually, they are working on it. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. They've just instated some bonus schemes where  As the poverty level I think is considered 13,000 pounds a year.  and if you're below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain extra bonus beyond. So there's a bonus for back to work. 

Recording: (6358/ 10721) 
 Oh yes! 

Recording: (6359/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly.

 I didn't even get a computer because I was so afraid of what they could be able to access. There was nothing barred at all when they first came out.  And where are all those software people? They're not responsible for Y2K. They're not responsible for all this internet access to all this stuff. So it's really hard. 

Recording: (6364/ 10721) 
 Oh no, no they move you around all the time when you teach kids with learning disabilities. They move you to where the population is rather than move the  kids to you. So yeah, I've been in Columbus and Worthington are the two systems I've been in, but you know that within those systems they can move you around from school to school.  I'm in at the same one now for, this is my seventh year at the middle school.

So, while I think Dole was correct, I think she shot herself in the foot. She would have never gotten the nomination.  as long as the party remains the way that it is, being controlled by the extreme right wing, which is a problem for the Republicans. They need to move towards the middle.

So they said, you know, you'll see larger airplanes when it's hollow  time so they can put more people on.

 Yeah, I don't know why. Columbus was just stubborn about it until the last year. They hadn't been able to get subs 50%.  substitutes 50% of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms. Well I don't know if the parents made  anything about it but I guess finally you know when you have 50% of your classrooms uncovered they came to it and it

But I think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it, you can  have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment.

And so I'm like, okay. I sit down. I said, your father killed himself this morning.  Oh, and then there's like a sort of a whiteout period there, so you don't get like decent details on what occurred. I don't actually think anything exciting occurred.

 you know, because they'll be grown up in a blink of an eye. So if I, I mean, if I put my career or whatever on hold, it's going to be worth it in  in the long run when my kids are grown up and they can be like yeah mom was there they taught me a mom and dad taught us you know all of our  life application skills that we need to know now and I think that that'll be better in the long run for them.

In other words, the way you qualify in the state of Ohio is  you have a 30 point discrepancy between your actual IQ and your daily performance. In other words, let's say you have 100 IQ, but in all of your classes, your performance is  like a 70 IQ person would. So if there's a 30 point discrepancy in there and people see that you're bright and but yet you're just not

Recording: (6413/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I love that show. I have nearly every episode on tape, but this past season I've been really disappointed with The Simpsons.

 All you do is you just keep your records of what you spend on things and then there's a form you fill out and how much you have if you've taken any depreciation you need to  basically put that back in and deduct your cost. And then there's a percentage that goes on your Schedule E that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income, and then it's just taxed.  It's just, it's really not that hard. 

Recording: (6422/ 10721) 
 Yeah. But those tend to be my least favorite concerts, although our conductor tries hard to make it interesting.  for orchestra members by bringing in some music that's interesting, challenging, or whatever for orchestra.  We're lucky to have him. He's an associate conductor for the Columbus Symphony. 

Recording: (6423/ 10721) 
 Why can't they fake ours to make it easier for us to understand? But usually there's no problem. The only problem we usually have is somebody like yourself who has never flown.  and it's taking lessons and you have about 10 or 15 hours and we tell you to do something and you like, well, I think I know what they mean.  just keep flying and it's the worst thing you can do. The best thing to do is say, okay, I heard what you said, but I'm brand new at this and I've got no idea what you mean. Can you try it again? And they'll go, okay. 

Recording: (6424/ 10721) 
 I don't know. Actually, probably if I went up there now, I would like it. But I don't like it as well as Columbus.  at all. Mainly, I suppose, because of the university. 

Recording: (6425/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we're getting impatient and we're getting, it's sort of like the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually, maybe 30 years from now.  there'll be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now I think we're we're really not  doing justice to the curriculum. And I say to my friends, I say, teach these kids well because they're going to be

 Yeah, but just to see the church might be fun. We, about how many years ago, seven or eight  years ago decided to build a new worship center building. And because we were really too big for the  sanctuary that we had.

But she chooses to be still at home and be a part  of our life. And my son, both of those kids have four points, I mean they really work hard in school because they know it's important. And my son, he was  the only one that was in seventh and eighth grade, he took that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at 16, and so I'm really

 That's a rule coming down hand down.

 Mm-hmm.

 Oh yeah, it's so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and looking at your house, the neighbors right behind you, you're staring at them sitting on their deck. We got all woods and a creek and then  the golf course. So that's hard to find in the city limits because we're inside 270 still.

 No kind of, you know, it just seems like our society just has that.  be just horrible to a person because they're bad. Well, you and I know that a bad person doesn't become better by being bad to them.

And it was just, they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or two's worth of candy and hid it out and they'd have an Easter egg hunt for them at school.

 Bleh.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (6588/ 10721) 
 God's in that, you know. Even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off in the wintertime, God's in that steam.  A lot of people can't understand that. But, so the laws of thermodynamics say that it's  for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can't be heated to an adequate point of withholding heat.

 Nobody ever you know what they wanted me to do is put him on a riddle And I didn't like him on riddle. I didn't like what it did to him

 Mmm. Yeah, give some charity and keep care of your bills and Probably go on that vacation you've been dying for like you're making my brain water here  here over Australia. 

Recording: (6592/ 10721) 
 But I think you have to exercise the mentality once in a while too, and that is trying to make it grow into other levels of atmosphere. 

Recording: (6593/ 10721) 
 So, I mean, it's something I'm comfortable with. 

Recording: (6594/ 10721) 
 See people now all of a sudden there's a rash of fires. You read that in the news and people keep doing it. I think society as a whole has gotten a lot more violent which may be  kids more violent. 

Recording: (6595/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we met at where we there's a singles ward where we call ward it's on 12th Avenue down here and  It's just where all the single people under 30 go to church and there's dances and different activities. 

Recording: (6596/ 10721) 
 No, no, they take the money whether you're in it or not. You have no choice. You have a choice as to whether you're a member or not, but they still take the money. And if you cross the line,  they'll take that money back. So anybody that... yeah you know you're better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time. I did some of that.  It's tough to, you know, Columbus has a big, you know, job market. Everywhere you look there's help on it. But it's tough to get a job where you can do that. 

Recording: (6597/ 10721) 
 for a long period of time. 

Recording: (6598/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (6599/ 10721) 
 And he was always like really red faced and the kids would say, you know, he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back. And that was one of the better schools in Columbus.  And I just saw a lot of that. I just saw a lot of principals driving big fabulous cars. 

Recording: (6600/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (6601/ 10721) 
 And there are some people that deserve to be fired. And there's no way that you can really differentiate just because they're in a union. 

Recording: (6602/ 10721) 
 Usually what happens is Bobby Knight doesn't worry too much about me, regular season.  Yeah, that's the way, that's the way you really should be. I mean, you got to be ready for tournament time, you know.  Everything will do.

 this would concern but I do think I don't know I mean with  With the birth control that is available and all the options that there are, sometimes  I find it hard to be sympathetic for these people who just have so many children that they can't feed, they can't take care of.  you

 you

 Whether it's a written goal or not, that's what they're doing. 

Recording: (6610/ 10721) 
 I live on the southwest side and work in Dublin. I don't get to campus very much. I get to campus, but it's usually up to the WSU Studios. 

Recording: (6611/ 10721) 
 Okay, that's not... It was better before. There, that's better. That's okay. I'll just try that. 

Recording: (6612/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6613/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6614/ 10721) 
 right? 

Recording: (6615/ 10721) 
 It was back in the 60s. 

Recording: (6616/ 10721) 
 어. 

Recording: (6617/ 10721) 
 Some of the really hard questions, why do bad things happen to good people? People can't just accept that bad things happen to good people.  happen to good people. They want to know why. I don't know why. I mean, yeah, I have a personal relationship with my God, but we're not on  on a conversational, I'm on this side of the table, you're on that side of the table. Why did this happen? He doesn't see fit to tell me why something happens, unless it pertains to me.  you 

Recording: (6618/ 10721) 
 Yeah, because I... 

Recording: (6619/ 10721) 
 You know. 

Recording: (6620/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6621/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (6622/ 10721) 
 but I just didn't hang out with the entire crowd. 

Recording: (6623/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6624/ 10721) 
 What does your wife do? 

Recording: (6625/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6626/ 10721) 
 So, but yeah, I think, you know, a lot of times you think, well, you know, I didn't even know you said, I won't call.  You know, all you do is call me, but it's not the same thing as being there. And she's, well, I remember one time when she was having a stomachache, she was like,  12 or 13 years old, you know, and I said, well, what's the matter? She goes, my stomach hurts. I said, oh, are you on your period or what, you know? 

Recording: (6627/ 10721) 
 Yeah, the one thing they've done is they've put on bigger airplanes because it used to be you know like a say a 737 would go from here to New York City and now it's a 737.  So that adds more seats. So instead of, because when I first got there I couldn't understand at OSU when it was like Christmas time or something it would just be  you drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you're like, oh boy. 

Recording: (6628/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6629/ 10721) 
 I don't really work with them, all I basically do is I know a lot of people and everything and they tend to come in there for help and I just kind of help out with the... 

Recording: (6630/ 10721) 
 I spent it in an unorthodox way, but I had fun doing it. 

Recording: (6631/ 10721) 
 My brother knows about it and my mother and that's the only ones in my family that are even aware of it. Because we just don't want to be bothered with all the questions. 

Recording: (6632/ 10721) 
 Let's put it this way, if your kids are in my yard doing something and I yelled at them, you're liable to come down to my house and either shoot me, sue me, or have me locked up, right? 

Recording: (6633/ 10721) 
 I do tomatoes anyhow. I'll pay the extra higher price for the better ones. 

Recording: (6634/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6635/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 That's true. 

Recording: (6637/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he says he knows VMS as well, but he doesn't like to do it, so he doesn't do it.

 Yeah, that was very exciting. 

Recording: (6639/ 10721) 
 that ran down, oh, 100, 200 yards from the gun position. So we took off down there.

 Okay.

 Yeah, and every. 

Recording: (6644/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I have two older brothers. One's 10 years older, the other one's 15 years older. 

Recording: (6645/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6646/ 10721) 
 Well, the opinion, kind of, like the general consensus around Upper Arlington is that OSU is not a good enough school. 

Recording: (6647/ 10721) 
 her husband is, believe it or not. They're not really, I wouldn't call them neat freaks, but we tease them because my parents and her live within a couple miles  of each other in Dublin and you have to take off your shoes when you go in which is really, it's amazing how good their carpet looks. 

Recording: (6648/ 10721) 
 I am signed up for architecture right now, which I like architecture, but I think there's probably more time into it than I'm ready to actually commit into it. 

Recording: (6649/ 10721) 
 Well, it was just communication wasn't there. 

Recording: (6650/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6651/ 10721) 
 Yeah, she was like a community liaison with our corporation. So I was a super  supervisor on my job and sometimes I would have very, very difficult clients that I needed advice.  from her on how to go about working with them. And I would call her and she would just be

 Yeah, it's probably about four years left. I'm almost done with all my GECs and everything like that, so that's about done. 

Recording: (6656/ 10721) 
 home. We interact. The school is great. You have people that are on the clock. Whoop, time to quit. They're gone.  Those people don't know the meaning of life. They will never know the meaning of life. But if they stay around, try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that's  problems at work and are willing to work with that person. I say willing to work, not knowing they're going to be compensated because they'll be compensated 

Recording: (6657/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (6658/ 10721) 
 Okay. I bet I'll go home and I'll wonder and wonder and wonder about this. 

Recording: (6659/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm.

 but

 and there were several couples who got married. 

Recording: (6663/ 10721) 
 because that's more boring. 

Recording: (6664/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there were white skinheads at our school that were racist against me for hanging  around black people. I didn't really have, I guess, I'm sure there was black people that were racist too, but I didn't, you know.  You know, not in school I didn't have problems really. 

Recording: (6665/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it was just like there was a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like  like preppy kids or like hick type kids you know 

Recording: (6666/ 10721) 
 really lucky that we had our difficulty at that point and it was minimal. But to me, having been used to everything being perfect.  You know, it was like for him to have.

 It's different.

 And most of your people that own guns that are killing people are usually your poorer people.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (6672/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well, it's just a grilled cheese omelet. Make it like grilled cheese, except omelet and cheese.  cheese and all your goodies inside. I've got a little secret recipe to throw in a little bit of this and that in. It tastes pretty good too.  to

 downtown, which is where one of my orchestras plays a lot. We sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them and what we didn't.  Maybe it had some feedback. I think the new building is acoustically very good. It's certainly much better than the old building.  Old Worship Center, because I don't know if you've seen a picture or anything of the church, but the Old Worship Center was designed by a modern architect to 

Recording: (6674/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6675/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6676/ 10721) 
 and go back and ask them. As I would ask my English teacher in school, anybody that said, well, what did this poet, what was his,  he wrote this poem and I gave my interpretation. No, no, no, that wasn't it. They'd share their thought. I know that was  He's been dead. 

Recording: (6677/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6678/ 10721) 
 I had always maintained that back in the day Darth Vader was a tragic hero of the Star Wars thing. It wasn't about the innocent  of Luke Skywalker in Rebellion and 

Recording: (6679/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (6680/ 10721) 
 Well, we put all kinds of information out on our own website, which there's so much it's very hard to find what you want.  That's the problem with information is the more you put out there, the harder it is to find what you want. But if you can't get to it, if it's not out there, you can't find it.  It's a problem for us and for libraries because there's just a barrage of what they're getting. And it's not just from us, it's from the literature. 

Recording: (6681/ 10721) 
 I was in the Cub Scouts. 

Recording: (6682/ 10721) 
 Right. Yeah. 

Recording: (6683/ 10721) 
 Oh, were they, they were already in the garage, did they not buy them themselves?

 all I've got available." She said, well you have to take it. I said, how do I talk to somebody else? She said, well you have to talk to me as long as you're in this college. I was like, where's the form? 

Recording: (6686/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6687/ 10721) 
 Well, some of them are, I guess, depending on where they go. But I had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid, she only has maybe one or  to  kids come in already knowing. That's how far behind they are. Used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name 

Recording: (6688/ 10721) 
 Yeah, like they all get the option, but I understand very few exercise it so You know if they were to not give them the the tuition that they could  that most of them aren't using and then give them the $2 an hour, but then you could say that OSU is helping to keep people down.  an odd balance there, it is. And like something like that doesn't seem too skilled to me so I don't really know why there's much of a union for that but yeah. 

Recording: (6689/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (6690/ 10721) 
 I think it was more just a family preference. I preferred family. 

Recording: (6691/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6692/ 10721) 
 There we go. 

Recording: (6693/ 10721) 
 No, the daughter's already taking golf lessons. 

Recording: (6694/ 10721) 
 They want to stay in the room, I know. I don't know, but I would know there was something going on.

 Yeah, man, I don't want to be over in the next County, you know driving in the middle of the sky going Yeah, a couple people down there floating around under me 

Recording: (6696/ 10721) 
 And it seems to be a fairly conservative university as well. 

Recording: (6697/ 10721) 
 It depends on what area you live in too. The area where I live in, you get little house because you're close to everything. Whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of the area you can  and get a bigger house. There's some really, really pretty ones.

Recording: (6699/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you go to class in one building and you go across the yard to another. Then you go to lunch and then you come across another in your locker.  All that stuff, it's just like a mini campus. 

Recording: (6700/ 10721) 
 I mean, not that I don't want to be on welfare, it's like a down when I want to go up, you know? 

Recording: (6701/ 10721) 
 Uh, as well, actually when I was at Ohio State I worked for the newspaper.

 She's the type that she's going to get through college. She's just one of those  that just moves right along. You know she's not the brightest you know but she's bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today.  And I was just like, well, I just want more help for my daughter. I just want somebody to jerk her down. 

Recording: (6704/ 10721) 
 And so you keep thinking, well, you know, they need more. But I was hoping they could use that land for something else. I don't know. There's, you know, there's so many, not building, but, you know.  know, something maybe, especially in Dublin, but it's probably will be good for Columbus.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6713/ 10721) 
 And the high explosive shells had 37 pounds of TNT in them. So they'd make quite a bang when they went off. 

Recording: (6714/ 10721) 
 Oh, there we go. Okay. 

Recording: (6715/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6716/ 10721) 
 He dropped out and that's where I come into play. I want to be the one that has that high school.  of us should have a high school diploma. He says he's going to probably go back and get his GED but it's like when, when do you have the time hun? You know, you work  so much. It's like, when can I get back to school? 

Recording: (6717/ 10721) 
 Franklin Park South is wonderful too, Franklin Park out east is beautiful too off of East Broad Street. Now that's volunteer also, their guards are volunteer.  They're on a grand scale. That's where the conservatory is.

 No, no, I'm, well, too many wires here, got it. No, it's basically 8-5, you know, Monday through Friday.  I traveled some and so I had to travel on a weekend so I got a comp time. 

Recording: (6719/ 10721) 
 Well, 

Recording: (6720/ 10721) 
 I moved into the dorms late September, last fall. 

Recording: (6721/ 10721) 
 you

Recording: (6723/ 10721) 
 But they always say don't let the animals sleep with you and all that. And with the cat, they curl up with you. It's hard to say. No, but you know what, honestly, eventually,  It took probably a year. 

Recording: (6724/ 10721) 
 Well, did you spend much time just passing through the airport in San Francisco? 

Recording: (6725/ 10721) 
 This is the only society that labels them mentally ill. 

Recording: (6726/ 10721) 
 you

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6730/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I did. 

Recording: (6731/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6732/ 10721) 
 Oh, okay, that was easy. 

Recording: (6733/ 10721)

 They just got different beliefs. She believes I mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (6737/ 10721) 
 and decide to go back for their jobs. If you notice, the first time that they voted, they voted down this proposal. The proposal that they're voting on this week is the exact same one. 

Recording: (6738/ 10721) 
 And I'm just using that as an example. I mean, your other drugs, I don't know much about them. 

Recording: (6739/ 10721) 
 Well, it's got to come from the top.  You know, I just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction.  So I would say you know it's an organizational problem. 

Recording: (6740/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6741/ 10721) 
 Right, you don't. 

Recording: (6742/ 10721) 
 They didn't like plot any weapon or anything like that, it was just fistfight, yeah. 

Recording: (6743/ 10721) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (6744/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6745/ 10721) 
 It started on my neck and went down, but it was automatic. And I mean, they had to take me to the emergency room. I didn't know what it was until... 

Recording: (6746/ 10721) 
 Just things like a waste of legislation, money. 

Recording: (6747/ 10721) 
 and it's it's one color text no pictures to always ask you what things look like and you don't can tell him and to it's like the computers are all screwed up like you type in  you know like typing computers and i'll say we don't have a movie obviously do and like the new look at a different way you'll be able to find like it's uh... that's really really got a stand 

Recording: (6748/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6749/ 10721) 
 they're in, you're just walking around like a crazy person all day. 

Recording: (6750/ 10721) 
 You know, decide where you're going. Why do you just waste all your time running around like that? 

Recording: (6751/ 10721) 
 First grade, the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed, but the principal wouldn't let her give it to him. He had to do what everybody else in the class was doing.  He was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade. And at the last grading period, every day she'd give him a math paper to work on. He said, I showed you on how  I'm not doing it. 

Recording: (6752/ 10721) 
 you know, society again is taking away everything from you. 

Recording: (6753/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (6754/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean you generally could, I mean they didn't broadcast it obviously but... 

Recording: (6755/ 10721) 
 It's just bazooka! 

Recording: (6756/ 10721) 
 The conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this. 

Recording: (6757/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and like, I don't know, that state's notorious for killing people. I think they killed someone last night. 

Recording: (6758/ 10721) 
 Well, my 29 year old, she's married and she has a child and she's having  She's expecting another one, and she's a senior here at OSU. She'll be graduating in June.  She's worked you know really hard and my son he's he's a 

Recording: (6759/ 10721) 
 Cool. 

Recording: (6760/ 10721) 
 they do offer sex ed but it's very scientific in nature. And then we did have a I think  actually in religion class where they paired you up, you were a couple and you had to go through budgets and chores and it was more that type of task. 

Recording: (6761/ 10721) 
 and they're at the Nazareth Towers, which is good because they get better care there. 

Recording: (6762/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6763/ 10721) 
 I did that until I came to a company that I stayed with for seven years and then they  to Dallas. So yeah. 

Recording: (6764/ 10721) 
 The, yeah. 

Recording: (6765/ 10721) 
 Some of them are pretty good at that. Some of them aren't, too. Some of them, like when you have them copy from this box down to this box, these little shapes in a certain amount of time.  If their visual perception is messed up, they screw that all up. The form goes this way, they draw it this way. Their brain flips it around on them.  trouble with N's and U's and B's and D's and they're still reversing you know normal kids that 

Recording: (6766/ 10721) 
 Well, in some ways, I guess it's necessary, but it's just, you reminisce about the way it used to look and, and, um,  I was just at a place last night. I was at this public comment meeting for the Little Derby National Wildlife Refuge.  that they're planning for Madison County. And there was some talk about that. And it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuge. 

Recording: (6767/ 10721) 
 Let's see. You usually go out to lunch at some fast food place, and then we get together and cook dinner. 

Recording: (6768/ 10721) 
 And it still is. And that was the problem with school. He just wouldn't do the work. I mean, you give him a test, and he could pass it and do really well, but he just wouldn't do the work.  you 

Recording: (6769/ 10721) 
 hating because he has all of these big government things and you're against big government. So I don't think people always see that, but between Gore and Bradley I don't see much difference.  quite frankly. Bradley's the more liberal. Gore, I think, understands the need to compromise, but I think Gore will be the candidate. I don't think Bradley will be able to go past  all of the work that Gore has been doing for eight years as vice president. 

Recording: (6770/ 10721) 
 I think so. He's not being forced to go in any direction that he's not ready for.  Yeah, I was going to college and going to work and I mean I think that their personalities are different too though so  So he was very independent, but I'm not sure that that's just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put. 

Recording: (6771/ 10721) 
 Yes, hopefully. 

Recording: (6772/ 10721) 
 A couple that are adopted will be able to get counseling for her. 

Recording: (6773/ 10721) 
 I don't understand that. And then when they do want you to do something, they abuse the hell out of you. You know, they give you a pager, a cell phone, they want to know where you are morning, noon, and night.  7 days a week and that's not their business. So the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate  I have a 

Recording: (6774/ 10721) 
 Yeah, the Brady Bill didn't really do it for America like they thought. I mean, yeah, you wait five days, big deal. Go out on 20th Avenue and  pick one up in five minutes. You know, I've seen all kinds of people carry guns that shouldn't. 

Recording: (6775/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6776/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6777/ 10721) 
 That's almost worse though, that it's not even a surprise. 

Recording: (6778/ 10721) 
 out this out to you, but he happened to be one of my fellow students out at Ohio University. Now, how he happened to learn all these things like he  I don't know. I didn't. Of course, he started out, I think the very first thing he was a township trustee like Paul was.  and ultimately became the mayor of Cincinnati. And he was a very effective, oh yeah, he was very, very effective. He was well liked. 

Recording: (6779/ 10721) 
 I mean, in some ways I think competition is a bad thing because in our society it's usually not fair. Someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further. But I mean, I like the fact  that we've got this super high tech tape recorder, not a big reel-to-reel thing. I like the fact that I could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than like...  going to the card catalog, finding out that there are books that are not in our library, and then where do I go from there? I like being able to look, oh, Library of Congress has it. I'll just drive out. 

Recording: (6780/ 10721) 
 real positive about it. But basically I lived here for my whole life and I grew up on campus. 

Recording: (6781/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6782/ 10721) 
 like  big but um it's kind of it's interesting here is you know you just go to like I mean sometimes they're at warehouses or or  Like auditoriums or stuff and it's just like dance music and lights and stuff It's real fun 

Recording: (6783/ 10721) 
 We're finished. 

Recording: (6784/ 10721) 
 You know, I think a lot of it depends on, I don't know if it's different parts of the country, but cultures and everything. Because, you know, it just seems in some  parts of the Midwest but maybe Kentucky and West Virginia seems girls down there a lot of them get married so young they just that's just what they want to do you know they don't but they're not thinking  of any future wanting to go to college or anything like that. I have to cough, is it okay? I'm sorry. 

Recording: (6785/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6786/ 10721) 
 I really hate that. Affirmative action and stuff totally burns me up. The idea is wonderful, but it's just executed very poorly.  poorly. I mean I saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get into places. I mean the Citadel was begging me to come. 

Recording: (6787/ 10721) 
 You could, but you could take it. 

Recording: (6788/ 10721) 
 I think the freshman class just ride along. I think the freshmen would be a little bit tougher. It would be tougher to be  walking around knowing different areas like me I didn't know where this hall was I was out there with 50 million halls around me and just stopped once and I said  I was like, where's Lazenby? And they, that way. Not too far from where I parked. 

Recording: (6789/ 10721) 
 are 

Recording: (6790/ 10721) 
 and  adjusting to being home and not being so yeah really and I mean I have to work at that because I've been so busy for the last  25 years, yes, makes it hard. 

Recording: (6791/ 10721) 
 I hate to be in the predicament of having to change anything. It would be hard to change for one group and not another. 

Recording: (6792/ 10721) 
 Probably would have been about six years ago. I ran in sixth or seventh grade. 

Recording: (6793/ 10721) 
 Yeah, my parents live in Akron, like north of Akron, Kiga Falls area. But like I said, I had an apartment down there, but for the summer I'm down here.  I'm a transient, always moving my stuff. 

Recording: (6794/ 10721) 
 because not only is he a chauvinist pig, but he's a bigot too. A racist. Yeah. So 

Recording: (6795/ 10721) 
 I don't know, I kind of see Al Gore winning just because he's the most like... 

Recording: (6796/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly, I know. 

Recording: (6797/ 10721) 
 I mean, that is a neighborhood mall. 

Recording: (6798/ 10721) 
 He's lying. 

Recording: (6799/ 10721) 
 I don't know. Like I said, I mean it's something, I basically see it almost as being the same thing as like cigarettes or whatever. Where...  I mean, yeah, it's bad for you, there's a lot of tar on it, things like that. But as far as what it, the effects it does to you, it's no worse than anything alcohol can do to you.  So I mean, I don't know, I mean, I'm not sure if they should actually go as far as to legalize it, but I don't think it's really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to do.  and 

Recording: (6800/ 10721) 
 Yeah, his mom couldn't take care of him anymore. And he was like, I think he was about 14 and he just, he didn't have really anywhere to go.  And luckily, these families had taken his different siblings, different families took them. I don't know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families.  that took care of him. But it was good for him because he's got that example. 

Recording: (6801/ 10721) 
 that like the parental influence isn't as much as, you know, before then. I think by the time that you are past adolescence. 

Recording: (6802/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's curious, isn't it? 

Recording: (6803/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. It's been glamorized and they don't they don't value human life either. I don't think because they're so  so much violence. You know you can't watch TV and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it's just like it's not really real.  because it's you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you're like see it wasn't real and I don't think they I think 

Recording: (6804/ 10721) 
 Well, Teeter's a school board member for Columbus. 

Recording: (6805/ 10721) 
 They have 

Recording: (6806/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (6807/ 10721) 
 아쉽다 

Recording: (6808/ 10721) 
 But it's just more of a close-knit thing, so it's more apparent how segregation works. 

Recording: (6809/ 10721) 
 Right. Well, not just one. My older brother would have been two and a half or three. 

Recording: (6810/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (6811/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (6812/ 10721) 
 So just trying to take my time, do what I want to do. Yeah. 

Recording: (6813/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6814/ 10721) 
 About once a week my wife sees her usually more than me 

Recording: (6815/ 10721) 
 Hediye etsene. 

Recording: (6816/ 10721) 
 He was from Brooklyn. 

Recording: (6817/ 10721) 
 They settled in Springfield, Ohio and then my mom met my father. He was from Petoskey. They met here at OSU when they were going to college and they settled here.  Columbus 

Recording: (6818/ 10721) 
 Right, but the ones that are racing are the ones that are the standards in the fields. Right, but more and more of those are also available on the web, but you have to subscribe  to them. So it's still an institutional subscription. Hey, that's a constant problem for the cereals people everywhere.  It's incredible what's happened with the costs. I've seen articles that say some of them have gone up $1,000 a year. 

Recording: (6819/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (6820/ 10721) 
 of  it's  I 

Recording: (6821/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (6822/ 10721) 
 or on your hard drive, because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft. Or I'll say to my students, have your mom look it over, have your sister look  it over, have somebody else proofread it, because you're not going to see the mistakes because you're too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say.  And you're not going to notice them spelled T-H-I-M or they T-H-A-Y. Yeah, or a sentence that's too long. 

Recording: (6823/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6824/ 10721) 
 to help calm them down. 

Recording: (6825/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's spring break. A couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids. 

Recording: (6826/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I do too. 

Recording: (6827/ 10721) 
 No. No, I'm interested. 

Recording: (6828/ 10721) 
 I never learned math. We had in fifth grade, we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables. He had a big pizza party planned for  for 

Recording: (6829/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (6830/ 10721) 
 Snap. 

Recording: (6831/ 10721) 
 You're like, hell no, I'm not paying for those damn cats. You're like, honey, it's just a cat. You know, it's my baby.  You can come home and visit at any time. I'm not paying you.  Alright. 

Recording: (6832/ 10721) 
 Yes, I mean, that probably, the circles I move in is what's coloring my whole view of Columbus. I mean, there's a lot, I'm sure there's a lot I don't know. 

Recording: (6833/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6834/ 10721) 
 So she mainly stays at home. 

Recording: (6835/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (6836/ 10721) 
 multiple health problems. He ran away for a while. There was drug abuse, alcohol, and he was essentially asked to leave high school. 

Recording: (6837/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6838/ 10721) 
 I think so. I think partial birth isn't such a big issue because I mean it hardly ever comes up. But I, with so many things it's like a, it's a foot.  in the door. If we can do that, then we can say, well, maybe not in the third trimester. And then we can say, well, not in the second trimester. 

Recording: (6839/ 10721) 
 not believe it, they know it. 

Recording: (6840/ 10721) 
 So it's pretty busy there, but it's spread out over the 16 hours, whereas in Port Columbus, sometimes you have maybe 75, 80  airplanes in an hour's time. 

Recording: (6841/ 10721) 
 You know, it don't matter what they are. 

Recording: (6842/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6843/ 10721) 
 So however this works out, you know, I don't know. I'm just like, okay. She just says, I just want to get it over with.  And see, now she, you know. 

Recording: (6844/ 10721) 
 She works at Franklin University. She's an assistant vice president there. 

Recording: (6845/ 10721) 
 Yeah, right. 

Recording: (6846/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6847/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6848/ 10721) 
 with both of them, but then the football players, you know, some of them were pretty much asses, you know.  way to put it, especially if they were got scholarships and stuff, you know, they were and they could be real nasty. But  I just can't say I don't know. I think maybe looking at it back. It's like oh I've got into arguments with a few of them and seen them later on you know and 

Recording: (6849/ 10721) 
 anymore you can change your brown eyes. You know they were born with it, it's genetic, someone else in their family has it. They can learn, they just don't learn the same way everybody else does. You have to break it  down into pieces or teach it a different way. It's like teaching a math problem two different ways, you get the same answer, but one way works better for you. Well, that's how they are. You know, maybe  Maybe they don't learn well by listening. Maybe they don't learn well by looking at a chart or something. Maybe they only learn well when they're up moving around, doing 

Recording: (6850/ 10721) 
 well he's polite I'll give him that much. 

Recording: (6851/ 10721) 
 came through and said it rated the paint an A, which meant according to their system A meant no 

Recording: (6852/ 10721) 
 I wouldn't worry so much about it. 

Recording: (6853/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6854/ 10721) 
 So I bought my house, you know, where I only had to drive two blocks. But then I had to move to Westerville. And one of my jobs there was I was a hiring supervisor for a department.  and we had about 150 people in the department. It was growing and I wanted  to hire minorities. 

Recording: (6855/ 10721) 
 Go out and have fun, person. 

Recording: (6856/ 10721) 
 I mean obviously everyone has their dark side, but I'd say in general people are pretty good people. 

Recording: (6857/ 10721) 
 Well, I enjoy this. But it'll be impersonal because here you are and I can't face you.  know whether you're really kidding me what you're talking about sitting there in that and that street cafe or not but I really do think we're going to be interconnected in that  sense and it becomes so much more impersonal. I guess I'm very strong about the term personal versus impersonal in communications. 

Recording: (6858/ 10721) 
 Eventually. 

Recording: (6859/ 10721) 
 Well, see, he moved into an apartment over on 11th Avenue. 

Recording: (6860/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. People say things like, well I wish I had a job where I got three months off every summer. And I'm just, I hear  people say stuff like that in the grocery store and I just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say, yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game I was grading papers at the kitchen  table. And if I go out of town on the weekend, I have to take my school bag and all my work with me. It never ends. I put in about 70 hours a week during 

Recording: (6861/ 10721) 
 a little but not not nearly like she is now 

Recording: (6862/ 10721) 
 I was thinking about putting my life on book, but I don't think they make that many pages. I have a 20,000 page book.  book. Yeah, 10,000 would be an introduction. Well, it all started. 

Recording: (6863/ 10721) 
 It's always been my feeling, and I try to be fair in the way I grade. I try to be as objective as I can.  Sometimes I, because I think it's important that people learn how to write, I would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short. 

Recording: (6864/ 10721) 
 I do really believe that if they would have something like that, that somebody would be  Even those shows, they're no good even for older people to watch. They aggravate me sometimes. I just try to walk through some of the stupid things they do.  I don't whether I've ever pointed out 

Recording: (6865/ 10721) 
 The only time I ever did. 

Recording: (6866/ 10721) 
 Oh my god. 

Recording: (6867/ 10721) 
 for more. 

Recording: (6868/ 10721) 
 acceptable so. 

Recording: (6869/ 10721) 
 Which I, she said that and I said. 

Recording: (6870/ 10721) 
 I help Janet somewhat, but not a whole lot. I have a project I work on, not as much as I probably should, but it's the Swan Cleaners project. And what we do, we have  little houses, donation boxes in all the Swan Cleaners. And there's probably about, probably a good 40, 45 of those.  throughout the city. So I'm in charge of that. I do some volunteer there. That's for the benefit of the Homeless Families Foundation.  you 

Recording: (6871/ 10721) 
 Well, I think a little bit safer idea than eliminating guns, because you know there's always going to be weapons out there.  Instead of eliminating the problem, more centralized it, make it a national law that you have to be a certain age.  Give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you're 

Recording: (6872/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6873/ 10721) 
 Right? But how old is your kid? 

Recording: (6874/ 10721) 
 and we monitor what they watch television wise. We do a lot of library things, get them to the library a couple days a week, try to keep them interested in  books. 

Recording: (6875/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there's some people there just get lazy. Then you got the college students. I don't know how many of them work, but most of them there's just from out of town.  down. 

Recording: (6876/ 10721) 
 to art, whatever it is, wherever it comes from. And there's not the old boy network, not as much who you know to get into.  things or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know. So it's not as closed off that way. 

Recording: (6877/ 10721) 
 But. 

Recording: (6878/ 10721) 
 Very boring. 

Recording: (6879/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure. 

Recording: (6880/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6881/ 10721) 
 You know? 

Recording: (6882/ 10721) 
 Sounds good. 

Recording: (6883/ 10721) 
 Yeah, because it's all continuously mixed. It's not real. I like it how the rave scene is kind of faceless because it's not more like rock  rockstar oriented and stuff, it's more like a serious type thing, but not so glam and fame oriented and stuff. 

Recording: (6884/ 10721) 
 Well, I'm not the mayor or anything so I'm not gonna make any promises. 

Recording: (6885/ 10721) 
 to control drug problem wise.  the  we're gonna do it matter what i mean same thing with guns if they want to get their hands on it doesn't matter what they have to do to it though the combine 

Recording: (6886/ 10721) 
 No. 

Recording: (6887/ 10721) 
 Like little Papoose. 

Recording: (6888/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (6889/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6890/ 10721) 
 But you know, and years ago, it's kind of funny, we seen each other and everything, and at some place down in East Sedona.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (6891/ 10721) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (6892/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6893/ 10721) 
 Don't really see anybody. I was totally ready to vote for Elizabeth Dolan and she opened her mouth and things came out and She had the best chance out of any  any woman that's ever run for president. And she was in a major party, which hasn't happened before. And it would have been really  funny to see what happened to Bob Dole over it. You know, be the first man after having run for the office. 

Recording: (6894/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, that's interesting. 

Recording: (6895/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and... 

Recording: (6896/ 10721) 
 never in Alaska or Hawaii, but for all. 

Recording: (6897/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6898/ 10721) 
 You know what I mean? 

Recording: (6899/ 10721) 
 What's embarrassing? 

Recording: (6900/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6901/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6902/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6903/ 10721) 
 Right, right. Well, it's sort of a problem as well that, you know, those, I mean, it seems, you know, from what I've read, if you wanted to make  a bomb it's fairly uncomplicated you know so. 

Recording: (6904/ 10721) 
 Oh, yes. 

Recording: (6905/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (6906/ 10721) 
 and work later then, which was fine by me. Or he'd call and he'd say, is it okay if I work a little late tonight? Would you care if I stayed here a couple more hours? Which I think is really nice. There are a lot of men that  you 

Recording: (6907/ 10721) 
 That's a thing. But the thing is, some people say, well, why did you do this? The thing is, why don't you talk to those people and say, hey, why not do this?  what I'm doing best. Now we complement the team. 

Recording: (6908/ 10721) 
 Originally Northside. 

Recording: (6909/ 10721) 
 whenever he runs, well, I thought he was going to be elected mayor too, but he didn't there, but I don't know what that was about, but.  You know, he's got his constituents, and they're going to re-elect him because he stands up for the minority. I think what he makes the mistake is—  labeling things racist that are not necessarily racist. But anyway. 

Recording: (6910/ 10721) 
 We are. 

Recording: (6911/ 10721) 
 that so that if you if whoever won you know would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time in my  better now. 

Recording: (6912/ 10721) 
 And no legal sanctions are going to make any particular difference to the attitude you have going into it. 

Recording: (6913/ 10721) 
 That would probably change my decision a little bit. 

Recording: (6914/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's a tour. It's a package tour. We have Rome, Florence, Venice, Pisa.  It doesn't interest me. 

Recording: (6915/ 10721) 
 Yeah, somebody's got to get, you know, put George Bush to the back. 

Recording: (6916/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (6917/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6918/ 10721) 
 waiting and they all want to go right now. You know and that's how most airplanes are. You know they don't think about anybody else. They think I'm here why aren't I first. You know so. 

Recording: (6919/ 10721) 
 All right. 

Recording: (6920/ 10721) 
 And that was it. 

Recording: (6921/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (6922/ 10721) 
 or they use the Bible to say, well, you know, God specifically says in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity. Well, who do you think wrote that? You know? 

Recording: (6923/ 10721) 
 And yeah, I would never want to go back to the old way, never. 

Recording: (6924/ 10721) 
 Yeah, so basically I learned with him. Y'all have to go do this, do that. 

Recording: (6925/ 10721) 
 because she enjoys cooking and makes it a little bit easier. I tend to overcook the meat. 

Recording: (6926/ 10721) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (6927/ 10721) 
 And you know that your parents are not going to say no to you anyways. 

Recording: (6928/ 10721) 
 A little geography wouldn't hurt. 

Recording: (6929/ 10721) 
 my current church and got plugged in there and I met someone there in  January of this year. We dated for two months and then I got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said, oh William  you're the person I'm going to marry. 

Recording: (6930/ 10721) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (6931/ 10721) 
 Yeah, right, because I always keep using my oldest daughter. She can get up in the morning and brush her teeth and just  Barely comb her hair, put on a shirt and a pair of pants and go somewhere.  to do that. And the oldest one, I look at her as, you know, I like myself and if you don't like me, well, 

Recording: (6932/ 10721) 
 I just hope he stays around. I don't know, maybe not, but I grew up without a father and I really have that against my father because he lived  around us. He never called us, you know, and I really got resentment against him. 

Recording: (6933/ 10721) 
 That'd be like, you know, what the hell, they putting on some kind of gay race to make you gay?  Yeah. 

Recording: (6934/ 10721) 
 and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage. That's where they met.  No, uh uh. I'd come down here two or three times, just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things.  When I moved to the city, it was a real big change because I used to live in the country and then I moved into smack dab in the middle of a downtown area. 

Recording: (6935/ 10721) 
 In the meantime, you know, you gotta pay the bills. So, I'm not sure what she wants to do.  She's had so many different kinds of jobs part-time jobs though. You know I'm when she was younger like 10 years  years ago she wanted to have her own talk show. 

Recording: (6936/ 10721) 
 He's an educator, which is all the more reason to homeschool. Because he sees it and he's like, yeah, they. 

Recording: (6937/ 10721) 
 you  You're not serious? No. 

Recording: (6938/ 10721) 
 Well, I've had the house for probably 6 or 7 years and we just need to move. It's kind of small. It's a smaller house.  My husband works in Gahanna so we were going to look for some houses up that way and maybe some land. We've been looking at some land up north too. 

Recording: (6939/ 10721) 
 No, they were from all over the world. I had one companion who was from Russia, but she was on a temporary mission, mostly all over America.  but there was a girl from Mongolia. There was girls there who I never was companions with them, but they were from Russia, different. There was a girl  from Moscow. My mission president was actually from St. Petersburg and his wife, they didn't speak English. 

Recording: (6940/ 10721) 
 I was a little bit on the piss side, yeah. 

Recording: (6941/ 10721) 
 One of the requirements is we have to be in the Honors College during undergraduate and fulfill all the requirements there. 

Recording: (6942/ 10721) 
 like to see what was going through their heads, you know. But that's something we'll never know. 

Recording: (6943/ 10721) 
 Oh, they do in ninth grade, and by 10th grade and 11th, they're a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they're going to have to go to college.  the only life they're gonna get, you know? They kind of get that realization, they start getting serious. Kids at middle school think everything's just a big joke, you know? I'm gonna play in a rock band.  You know, they all think they're going to be rock stars and drummers and, you know, they could care less about anything. It hasn't hit them yet. This is my real life. 

Recording: (6944/ 10721) 
 I'm about sick. Yeah. Did we get her? We've had her for two years. Yeah, we did about six months. We went to Hawaii and got his brother married. And then we came back. We knew  that would be the last long trip. We were going to wait until the spring but we couldn't so we went to a rescue service and got her. 

Recording: (6945/ 10721) 
 It would have been a lot better, I think, for myself and everything, you know what I mean? If we would have been able to have had Jornt Kesty with her and everything, you know, when she was growing up.  Because from or by her being out there, I mean, you know, you can just imagine she's you know, then being a girl nothing girl anything bad about girls being my daughter, you know  about things in school and weekends and stuff like that. So, or if I was closer to her, 

Recording: (6946/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6947/ 10721) 
 The teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital. Those things happen. 

Recording: (6948/ 10721) 
 Banking? Okay. 

Recording: (6949/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I really think both of them will be good parents someday. But she says, we're not ready. 

Recording: (6950/ 10721) 
 I feel like I should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting high. 

Recording: (6951/ 10721) 
 I don't think that's going to ever happen. I think we'll turn that thing around. I think this so-called divorce rate program, as I talked about a while ago, every  or 50% of the people who marry within five years are no longer together. I think that will change and that is a very significant thing.  I think in terms of getting back to the basic family. 

Recording: (6952/ 10721) 
 I mean, there's nothing bad about them or anything that they... 

Recording: (6953/ 10721) 
 Brother Jeb. 

Recording: (6954/ 10721) 
 and then there's the one that's like, oh, I wish I had two weeks off at Christmas. Well, I used to work at Harding Hospital as a teacher when I first went to Worthington when I said I got another  job. I got a job working at Harding Hospital as the principal but I was also a teacher. So I taught part of the day and I was also the administrator. Because they had a small  school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credits somewhere. So the doctors always used to 

Recording: (6955/ 10721) 
 help him be able to move into the fraternity. I think he can get out of the apartment by sub-leasing it. But he has  to get the $75 to give to the landlord to they charge $75 to do that to advertise and  Screen. 

Recording: (6956/ 10721) 
 It is. 

Recording: (6957/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6958/ 10721) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (6959/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you can't ignore it. Because that's something else. When I was in high school, I don't think I knew the word.  Now everybody knows. Anybody who's a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot. And so it's better if you can  and diffuse that, but I, boy, I wouldn't know how to approach it. I mean, I think it should be approached, but, ooh, I wouldn't have a clue. 

Recording: (6960/ 10721) 
 That's okay. I'm being Indiana. 

Recording: (6961/ 10721) 
 but having having done it before you know and uh... knowing where i want wrong uh... that would happen again  I've been off that shit for a while but that was again that was back in the uh actually it was in the 90s early 90s but you know I was been doing it when we were  We were a recreation type of thing, you know, not as a daily, you know, somebody come knocking 

Recording: (6962/ 10721) 
 What it is is most people don't want kids to live in reality. 

Recording: (6963/ 10721) 
 more expensive so everyone has a lot less. And here it's like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it's like, you know, picture frames or something there, it might be, you know, $25  for one, so you buy one here. Oh, they're $5 a piece, let's buy five. 

Recording: (6964/ 10721) 
 Oh, okay. Is that Silicon Valley? 

Recording: (6965/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6966/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but guns are always gonna be around, you ain't gonna get rid of them. 

Recording: (6967/ 10721) 
 No, I worked at the library when I was a student. 

Recording: (6968/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (6969/ 10721) 
 So 

Recording: (6970/ 10721) 
 computers that figure it out just zip, zip.  we had to locate our positions on a map. 

Recording: (6971/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (6972/ 10721) 
 You're right. I never went back home. 

Recording: (6973/ 10721) 
 That's it. 

Recording: (6974/ 10721) 
 that you had two dads. 

Recording: (6975/ 10721) 
 I called my mom first and I told her I'm on my way up and then called the IRS in Cincinnati and told them that he owns a business.  He's got this and this and this and he paid me and this other guy under the table this much and you're technically only allowed to have so many hours a day to be doing  free jobs, or tax free jobs. And I was agreeing with it until he got on my bad side. 

Recording: (6976/ 10721) 
 You see? 

Recording: (6977/ 10721) 
 Never I used to Have an office out there that business all the time, but I've never been out there to she actually lives in Kirkwood which is a suburb 

Recording: (6978/ 10721) 
 Yeah and they're all so different but he deals real well with people so he's really and he's even thinking of going into business for himself. Yeah he almost did that this  year and then he thought, no I don't want all the headaches. So he's like the top guy of the people that he works for. 

Recording: (6979/ 10721) 
 Well right now I think he knows enough. I'm just letting him be creative. He loves playing with his Legos and building things. I'm pretty I'm like wow I can't even build the stuff that he  He makes ships and cars and rockets and... 

Recording: (6980/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and the problem is seeing things in other people. I mean actually seeing spirits.  in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that's very true you know I could see in  in certain people's eyes when I was in the hospital, the confusion, the unsure feelings 

Recording: (6981/ 10721) 
 Well, they always did because the first time I had one I was 36 years old. 

Recording: (6982/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6983/ 10721) 
 it is yeah because pediatricians are able to dispense it and  I just felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible growing up. 

Recording: (6984/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, we just don't really talk about that very often and I'm just 

Recording: (6985/ 10721) 
 Nobody really admits it but oh I grabbed the paper because I want to see what the agreement was and it's pretty much the same thing and They're voting positively for it this time 

Recording: (6986/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6987/ 10721) 
 But I do believe if you know when you're in love and you love somebody you will not you will not cheat on them. 

Recording: (6988/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (6989/ 10721) 
 And outside of English, French is a horribly popular language for different countries to have as a second language. So I think it would be extraordinarily useful to me now if I had a greater understanding of French. 

Recording: (6990/ 10721) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (6991/ 10721) 
 always had the gun. Well, obviously that's not true, you know. My personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms if you're a Billy Gawaitian.  and everything, I'm not really sure the background checks really do that great of a job. 

Recording: (6992/ 10721) 
 So I guess, I mean, that was really, really hard for me. I would call all my family members. I had family members coming over to try to figure out what to say.  child needed but I don't know I couldn't tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go through that where he just did not quit crying. 

Recording: (6993/ 10721) 
 and they fly checks. Like if you write a check today and you deposit it in the bank, well that check has to go from your bank to clearing house. And that's all they do all night long. 

Recording: (6994/ 10721) 
 Yeah, oh yeah, the five-year-old just after the whole time, the minute she walks in the door, you know. 

Recording: (6995/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (6996/ 10721) 
 just like premarital sex. I mean, there was no way I would ever discuss anything like that ever with her. I mean, that was just something that you didn't 

Recording: (6997/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6998/ 10721) 
 Janet, we just had a man who took time to show us. 

Recording: (6999/ 10721) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (7000/ 10721) 
 and just start picking a fight with him. 

Recording: (7001/ 10721) 
 yeah, but I said fine. I don't even think about it. So it's kind of like 

Recording: (7002/ 10721) 
 I don't see any reason for it myself, but that's interesting. When the first, when the,  When time began, according to my, what I believe in and everything, it was man and woman got married.  And the reason they got married is because of procreation, you know, to keep the population going. I think that's the way it was set up originally. 

Recording: (7003/ 10721) 
 Don't you think? 

Recording: (7004/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7005/ 10721) 
 I'm going to give up this life here and go to the third world and live. Or let's do, let's reverse busing. Hey, okay, Upper Arlington, you live on the northwest side, why don't you go down the  live on the East side. 

Recording: (7006/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (7007/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (7008/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7009/ 10721) 
 Hehe, oh yeah! 

Recording: (7010/ 10721) 
 Mmm, yeah. 

Recording: (7011/ 10721) 
 That would be good. 

Recording: (7012/ 10721) 
 very slow, very methodical. We take them to dog, my husband's taken them many times when they had to have cataract operations, you know, so he's involved with  the girls too. 

Recording: (7013/ 10721) 
 I don't think my victim that was so close to me would want me to do. 

Recording: (7014/ 10721) 
 Oh, I see. 

Recording: (7015/ 10721) 
 right 

Recording: (7016/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's just like having alcohol around. I mean, gambling is a lot like alcohol. It can be addicting, it can screw your life up.  You'll spend your last dollar on it if you're that far gone. So pretty much anything can be one of those factors.  you 

Recording: (7017/ 10721) 
 what she wanted to do and he may have been stupid and a cad but I don't want to know about it. On day one when it hit the news I didn't want to know about it and on the end when he  was not impeached, I didn't want to know about it. And in between, I didn't want to know about it. And they just kept angering me because there were other things I wanted the government to do. And this  Congress is the worst I've ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse of where America is on such issues as gun control and 

Recording: (7018/ 10721) 
 better head start on development so 

Recording: (7019/ 10721) 
 Oh, they're very good. Like, you call. I usually just call and I walk down and by the time I get there, the subs are ready. 

Recording: (7020/ 10721) 
 were people that were opposed to the wildlife refuge, mostly people that lived there near their farmers. But it seemed like the one thing that almost everybody there agreed on  on was they didn't want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments.  Somebody was talking there about the difference between development here in the United States and in Europe and how development in Europe tends to 

Recording: (7021/ 10721) 
 Right, and all the babies in the hospital will be covered under my son's insurance, and she's covered under her father's insurance. So their medical expenses are not going to be very big. 

Recording: (7022/ 10721) 
 And a lot of them has been getting off the hook lately. You see this guy on hard copy. He killed this woman's husband.  because he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions.  Now, I think that there's things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide  you 

Recording: (7023/ 10721) 
 I like to talk about Columbus. 

Recording: (7024/ 10721) 
 Columbus 

Recording: (7025/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (7026/ 10721) 
 something and that burned his pocket. I don't know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or whether he went up on his own but he went up  to the store and I think, I don't know whether Mary went up and got him or what, anyway she found  So when I came home, she told me what had happened. I said, well, that just can't be. 

Recording: (7027/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there's a girl at the store I was talking to and she saw how I wrote my signature. If you look right there,  She asked if I was a doctor. 

Recording: (7028/ 10721) 
 Do I think they will? Oh yes, I think they definitely will. I think there's so much heavy political and financial... Well, I'm going to reverse that statement. There's so much heavy financial...  influence upon the political influence that it is almost a foregone conclusion. And if it doesn't occur within this year,  and there may be another vote in another year or next election. But I think that in fact it will go. 

Recording: (7029/ 10721) 
 And it's not just like one group of people. 

Recording: (7030/ 10721) 
 can have a gun. I mean if they want a college education. Yeah it's not fair. But for you  growing up and going into a lifestyle, I would prefer having their colleges paid for and them being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they didn't get an education.  I mean, that's a broad spectrum and I know it's not all that cut and dried. Yeah, it would upset me, but hopefully I'd step back from it a little bit. 

Recording: (7031/ 10721) 
 So I think she's getting a better education than he did, but it's because she's doing the work and she knows she's expected to in high school.  My son's the kind he'd rather play than work, and so he wrote a lot. 

Recording: (7032/ 10721) 
 Whereas, I don't know, Lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (7033/ 10721) 
 Big ball of fur. Do they have like little babies that carry in their pouches like kangaroos? 

Recording: (7034/ 10721) 
 We don't know who's in the airplane, but there are seaplanes that do come in and out of there. 

Recording: (7035/ 10721) 
 I think I'm gonna, I really like the riser military because it shows discipline, responsibility, respect.  Columbus public school and the kids will lash out on substitute teachers. I think it's really crazy. I think you should have a lot more  respect for your elders, your adults. 

Recording: (7036/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they're going to most likely raise it up to 21 since all these Kentucky and Maryland,  all those school shootings and I can't believe man I mean there's articles in there you wouldn't even believe if you haven't read them 

Recording: (7037/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7038/ 10721) 
 If you got an eight inch barrel on your gun, now you tell me where you're going to put it. 

Recording: (7039/ 10721) 
 Well, I know about the gorilla masks, and it's a women's organization.  to promote women artists and to object to the male hierarchy. Only men are in the museums and only men get the  big gallery shows and stuff like that. 

Recording: (7040/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7041/ 10721) 
 You like the university level. 

Recording: (7042/ 10721) 
 You look forward to coming home and the pet's waiting on you. 

Recording: (7043/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and because I, back when I was in high school in my AP government class, I was paying attention a lot, you know, like I read the Columbus Dispatch every day and I read  US News and World Report for my economics class and I was totally caught up with everything. 

Recording: (7044/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7045/ 10721) 
 You know what I mean? You can't do this, you can't do that. 

Recording: (7046/ 10721) 
 I always understood each other.  we understood each other much better than my mother and I did. We were able to communicate in very similar fashions. We didn't always agree, and in fact I  probably more diametrically opposed to him than anybody else I ever got to play with, but at least he understood what was going on from one moment to the next. 

Recording: (7047/ 10721) 
 Hehehehe 

Recording: (7048/ 10721) 
 And I don't know whether my second, I don't think my second sister ever went to school out there. But things were so terrible.  tough that then mom had taught school in Iowa where she grew up and got her teacher's certificate.  So I guess she and dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with us kids through 

Recording: (7049/ 10721) 
 So there's, from what I hear, one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it. 

Recording: (7050/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (7051/ 10721) 
 There's too much information and too much change. Librarians, this is against probably what the image of librarians are. They're very eager to embrace change.  The internet came out and when it got out of the area it was being used by universities or whatever for research, that's what it was at first.  Librarians were right there and they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it. PCs.

So I came to college and I got into the  honors engineering program called the Gateway Program.

 I personally agree with that, but that's just from my own moral beliefs and everything. But I don't know. I don't think that there's one solution.  that will fit every child and every situation.

 Well, honestly growing up it wasn t really called sex ed. They talked about the female reproductive system. Nothing  about men, which is kind of funny. It was always the women in that chart.

 I heard something the other day that really upset me. I was at this convention downtown, the convention center, and I wanted to  Ladies that was presenting one of the workshops as a college professor in English at one of the Ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in 1985  She teaches writing, technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world, reports and stuff.

You know, well, sometimes it takes a couple years to reload, you know.  But I've never been a guy have a fan of the Cooper either They just says some stupid things

 It makes me angry that people like that even get money.

 इह हूँ 

Recording: (7063/ 10721) 
 Oh, definitely. 

Recording: (7064/ 10721) 
 So I was shut out of the job market then. That didn't bother me. I thought, well, fine. That's when I got the job at Channel 4. But it's like anything else.  Some blacks use it for good, some blacks use it for bad. 

Recording: (7065/ 10721) 
 little different. 

Recording: (7066/ 10721) 
 the risks and what goes into it. And like I said, I mean, it doesn't really hurt anyone the high part of it. 

Recording: (7067/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 Maybe.

 the same every day and not just like a lecture and when we do homework and turn it in like you know it's like we do like a history class we do like role role playing things and  like 

Recording: (7070/ 10721) 
 I keep thinking, I want to go back and take some classes. I keep thinking I'd go back to school, but I can't even narrow down what I would want to take. There's so much stuff, or so many areas that are interesting to me.  you

 Well, the minor league hockey team, the Columbus Chill, they don't have it now, but because the Blue Jackets came in. But I think it'd be good if it goes, but.

Recording: (7072/ 10721) 
 We're buying it, yeah. And we should have paid off about five years. Then we're talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of. 

Recording: (7073/ 10721) 
 And it's kind of weird because when I went from middle school to high school, it was like a big growing up period. And I see them like, what are you doing that for? 

Recording: (7074/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7075/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 Exactly, yeah.

 As far as I know, she was planning on going to St. Louis University, which I wanted to go to the University of Missouri. 

Recording: (7080/ 10721) 
 I'm sorry.

 do it the hard way or the easy way. Well, I think everybody should have to do it the hard way. I mean, frankly, I think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it. 

Recording: (7084/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think they do. 

Recording: (7085/ 10721) 
 Not that I've seen, you know. 

Recording: (7086/ 10721) 
 if they hold enough of my views. I'm not going to vote for a woman just because they're a woman. And I'm not going to vote for a Democrat just because they're a Democrat. They better have at least  and I don't need 100% agreement with my views, but I'd like to be in the 90 to 95% range.  I don't tend to vote straight party line either. As I said, I've moderated from when I was in college to today. 

Recording: (7087/ 10721) 
 and then when I went out there she had security remove me off the premises that following Monday because I was supposed to go out and sign something for a  lease. Didn't really happen that way. I went and signed it and I came back to school Monday thinking yeah well another day another dollar or whatever.  get there and they go ahead and out the door. 

Recording: (7088/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7089/ 10721) 
 Like, I'm not really sure how the interview works to become a teacher.  I don't know. I think it's like a lot of times. They're really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever I mean They're lucky enough to even have a body  to fill the place and they're doing well enough. I mean, the kids are learning the material, I mean, sort of. I mean, it's working well enough, I guess. 

Recording: (7090/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7091/ 10721) 
 when you believe in things and you're at your most idealistic and you would think that kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that.  In addition to that, and as an undercurrent, it wasn't overt in the Clinton campaign, but I know when I talk to people, and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion  is a very divisive issue in this country. And I think it does mobilize people, but it also divides them, you know, definitively, almost like in Vietnam, almost 

Recording: (7092/ 10721) 
 I knew that kindergarten, because it's not required in the state of Ohio anyway, they really aren't required to be in school or enrolled in anything.  until they're six by September. When I found that out, I was like, oh, okay, cool. You know, I can keep him home. I mean, he's, he could probably go into the second grade. I mean,  I mean, he's very bright. He can read and write and add. So it's a challenge for me. 

Recording: (7093/ 10721) 
 Yeah, with all the controversy about that and Polaris. I don't know. It's Northland is such a  a good location for all the people around there and it's certainly not, you know, a neighborhood that people don't need.  shopping so I didn't see the difference of having both. I mean there's Lazarus everywhere, there's Sears everywhere, why not have it both places? I mean I wouldn't particularly go up to Polaire 

Recording: (7094/ 10721) 
 the CD in. Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (7095/ 10721) 
 plus the mental health aspect of it and everything. 

Recording: (7096/ 10721) 
 I think the divorce rate has gone up because it's more socially acceptable. I'm sure there's plenty of people 20 years ago that would have loved to have gotten a divorce.  had that been an option. I think a lot of it depends on the way you handle it. How you handle it after the divorce is final.  Do you see what does that make any sense at all? 

Recording: (7097/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7098/ 10721) 
 So I just see a pattern, you know, I just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually. 

Recording: (7099/ 10721) 
 And he does have a responsibility, but I think there could be a line drawn to how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been, you know.

 Oh really? Where are you from? 

Recording: (7101/ 10721) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (7102/ 10721) 
 It's just not wasted. 

Recording: (7103/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7104/ 10721) 
 And the problem is as a youngster as you grow up, you don't realize how much your parents did for you until you're probably about 35, 40, you don't realize, my goodness.  I'm dead you made a sacrifice because now I'm learning a little more what you did and then by the time you're maybe 60 50 60 now you got to take care  Take care of your parents if you have the morals to do it. Otherwise, you just ship them off to the farm

Recording: (7108/ 10721) 
 models to look at and not just playing round ball or the spiral. We need to get them out there and say, how are you going to perform in school?  I'm sure Michael Redd has some mentors out there. You see guys wearing number 5 and whatever the number is, 8 and whatever. Ok, there's a reason for it.  What's the other part of it? We don't do it because why? We don't want to bring it up. We don't want to bring some embarrassment possibly. 

Recording: (7109/ 10721) 
 Right, right. He would go for weeks, he would get mad at me and not speak to me when I was growing up for a week or two at a time. My mother would say, please, Nance, I changed my name when I went to college. I just decided  I'm out of here, everything's gone. And so she would say, Nancy, please just talk to your father, just for my sake, please talk. And I would think, I'm the child here, I shouldn't have to.  to be the one to make peace in this family. If he doesn't want to talk to me, I don't need him. I don't have to talk to him. 

Recording: (7110/ 10721) 
 I know I wish I knew how to sew. I can do buttons, that's about it. 

Recording: (7111/ 10721) 
 you know, concertina wire and barbed wire and all those, like a big, big brick wall and whatever, you can actually still see it unless they tore it down.  Okay, just like to preserve the history of it, okay Right  So you actually, it's neat because you were like a part of that history, at least when you were over there.

 Oh, that's right.

 Attention deficit hyperactive disorder. 

Recording: (7114/ 10721) 
 quote-unquote religious ways, but I don't believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person, because there's a lot of...  hypocrites are good at church. These kids, I think more, just more than anything else. I mean, one thing I remember hearing a lot about too  or they were picked on. 

Recording: (7115/ 10721)

 Damn, what a problem. Don't you wish you had those kind of problems, huh? 

Recording: (7119/ 10721)

Recording: (7120/ 10721) 
 I'm not.

 So it's gonna be tight for our family for a few months, you know, to get back on. 

Recording: (7133/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it was five weeks early delivering. So it was really unplanned as far as when we were expecting it. 

Recording: (7134/ 10721) 
 and I understand that mentality now because I went back but I'll tell you the reason I left was it sounds stupid but he took my teddy bear which I loved and I've had for  not since I was a child, but at least five years at that time. And he just, he knew I loved it. 

Recording: (7135/ 10721) 
 I don't know, it's possible, but I can't imagine it would... Not knowing how big it's going to get, I guess, I can't imagine. 

Recording: (7136/ 10721) 
 I don't know. I don't want to get shot. 

Recording: (7137/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly. You can bring that in-house, I think. I mean, I don't know, I might go out like we should and be completely wrong. 

Recording: (7138/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7139/ 10721) 
 And they're like, wow, let's do this too. We can make school let out for a little bit. They might not be doing it to. 

Recording: (7140/ 10721) 
 Oh, well, I was going to say, when you're talking about traveling, you'll be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling. I know I'm like, my husband goes to Europe and goes, you know,  He goes to California every month and he goes as little as possible. But the point is, if we wanted to be traveling, he could be going a lot more.  more, a lot longer. Now he just goes for a couple days time just to get back here because I don't like him to have to get, well he doesn't want to be away from us. But you're 

Recording: (7141/ 10721) 
 So I try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk. 

Recording: (7142/ 10721) 
 Wow, yeah 

Recording: (7143/ 10721) 
 I don't know.  What their friends did and what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as  anything that the school could do. But I know the school is a very powerful force in a kid's life. I mean, it is a kid's life. 

Recording: (7144/ 10721) 
 Heheh 

Recording: (7145/ 10721) 
 I wouldn't have been smiling from down there to up here when he dropped me off. He didn't even know.

 But it's like a democracy over there in Australia. They don't have a king and queen.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (7150/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I could. 

Recording: (7151/ 10721) 
 And it's just like cocaine and stuff like that. Your laws are different. Crack cocaine's one. The powder cocaine's another. And what they're saying on that.  I'm sure you read the paper. The way I look at it, I've had four heart attacks in my life.  Every time I have a heart attack, they swear up and down, I do cocaine.

Well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it's prescriptions and things you know I mean that you've taken  But they, I don't know, I think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore. I really do. 

Recording: (7154/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7155/ 10721) 
 and it's not fair to her or the other people. 

Recording: (7156/ 10721) 
 Yeah, by then it was junior year when we were wrestling varsity and everyone just figured it was two more years left. They could just struggle through it. 

Recording: (7157/ 10721)

Recording: (7158/ 10721) 
 Is there anything else you need to know or 

Recording: (7159/ 10721) 
 most of my friends are, they act like kids.

 Although, Janet, you just said yesterday that people are so overweight in Columbus because there's not very much to do, that actually

 Oh, yeah. 

Recording: (7164/ 10721) 
 people drive by and look at my little house there in the middle of it all. 

Recording: (7165/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7166/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I don't think that though. Women need to work and most families do need two incomes. Plus when kids go into high school, you have to  Pardon me, you have to worry about them, but you have to let them experience some of life on their own. 

Recording: (7167/ 10721) 
 I'm working here, but work-studying. 

Recording: (7168/ 10721) 
 Dope. 

Recording: (7169/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7170/ 10721) 
 And the administrators for telecommunications for the state of Ohio are working with us as observers because they don't have staff. 

Recording: (7171/ 10721) 
 So I kept my $1 and got a $1 ad in on. Yeah, there's.  And then there's these little bit more expensive cards you buy that  lottery cards one of them is called battleship that I've won a lot of money off of. 

Recording: (7172/ 10721) 
 because he's like, he'll like get out. He is like, I don't want to be in the bed with these guys and he'll get on the floor and he'll sleep on the comforters on the floor, but he's close and  He's happy that way.  I guess you could say she's into attachment here. 

Recording: (7173/ 10721) 
 Only with her, those students who are high achievers, who are very bright, talented, maybe truly gifted, who are willing to jump through the hoops. 

Recording: (7174/ 10721) 
 Chantalou helped. 

Recording: (7175/ 10721) 
 Yeah, go in there and find out, you know, is the kid being abused? If the kid's being abused, you know, take them out. You know, forget the parents' rights, you know. Or, um...  If they're using drugs, put them somewhere and get them in rehab. Keep them there. Just don't throw them there for three days.  and then throw them out. It's a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing's getting accomplished. 

Recording: (7176/ 10721) 
 I got into painting somewhat recently. I've always done a lot of art. My mom is an elementary school art teacher, so I was always exposed to art.  art as a child did pretty good too. But I never got into painting, it was mainly drawing, that kind of thing. And just three or four years ago I thought, I'm going  learn how to paint and I learned how to paint. 

Recording: (7177/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I have read that. I need to try that. Just for winter, even. 

Recording: (7178/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7179/ 10721) 
 It's, regular's enough for me in that. And I didn't have, I couldn't schedule the honors. 

Recording: (7180/ 10721) 
 people say oh you can do it so but I really feel like there's nothing like if I if it's inalienable the definition is it's not able to be taken not even by your  yourself. That's why you can't commit suicide. And since it's the highest thing, because without it you can't even do the other, so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can't  do the you can't be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it's inalienable because I didn't give it to you I can't take it back you 

Recording: (7181/ 10721) 
 You know 

Recording: (7182/ 10721) 
 we want. But so I think for a lot of times people do fall and just sort of but I I was not raised  Mormons. So I have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church. And also because it's so new to me that I  I'm just, you know, I will talk about it with anybody and, and, and so and I'm also not afraid of 

Recording: (7183/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7184/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I met a lot of different people in there, a lot of interesting people. 

Recording: (7185/ 10721) 
 Oh well, that's unfortunate. 

Recording: (7186/ 10721) 
 Oh, I'm not shocked at the bad behavior of the animal. I don't consider it's justice. 

Recording: (7187/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's like the woman that used to live in the apartment where we lived before us. See, she had a husband that she was married to  for quite some time. He got on Ohio's number one DUI list with 18 DUIs.  Man, can you imagine how much money he's put into that? I mean you'd think your first DUI offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend 

Recording: (7188/ 10721) 
 Whenever it comes on I roll my eyes. That episode where they were stuck out in space and the tape can catch me rolling my eyes.  Just... 

Recording: (7189/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (7190/ 10721) 
 so that he got down in an area under that concrete floor. The concrete was about so deep, which 

Recording: (7191/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, where would you send it? If you could send it to one of the TV programs and have like Oprah Winfrey or somewhere and get it all over the world, you know, all over the United States or something so people really  hear it, then maybe it might do some good if people would begin to speak up. You know what, why don't they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what do people really think it would help  to do instead of having things like Oprah Winfrey and who's those other couple guys to get on and ask the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (7192/ 10721) 
 And part of it was just being stupid, but it was down around the Mount Vernon area and they got very little money.  but I wasn't hurt. 

Recording: (7193/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7194/ 10721) 
 And then how satisfying is that to them? When you have a chance to talk to them? That's where we need to learn more from, interview, have more meaningful interviews with these people.  that we can learn from them. They put them in the spotlight, but we somehow, we just don't want to, I guess, flood them with the...  We don't want to get the negative answer because it might hurt the image of the university. Oh, gee, no. Who was it? Katzenmaier or something? 

Recording: (7195/ 10721) 
 Well, her major is communications. It didn't start out that, but my daughter wants to write books. OK? Well.

 in favor of publicizing it and all that, I don't see what they expect to get out of it.  I mean if they, they, uh,  In fact, I don't think that they do gain anything by it.

 My honors class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging, but

 Well, my oldest one is really odd because the school she goes to, it's sort of like thrift store chic. And a lot of kids there go to  thrift stores and buy their clothes and I told her, I said, you know, we are not in the poorhouse, you're not buying clothes at the thrift store. So she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it.  and I thought, oh my gosh, you know, cause she just looks like a bum, I think. And you know, when it was time for like a, um, a dance or something, she would go out and buy a dress, you know,

 It's just been my experience, unfortunately. I hope it gets better, but like I said, I haven't been ever  ever told that my degree matters by any employer.

 That's number three.  Well, personally I voted that the 33 should pass. I think they should.

Recording: (7273/ 10721) 
 and they would have made it so I wouldn't have had to make the decision. I mean, that was a hard decision to make.

 Yeah, for everybody. So it's kind of a really big deal. And my parents are the oldest from their families too. So it's a first great grandchild and with  My husband, he is the oldest, so for everybody. 

Recording: (7275/ 10721) 
 I think the reason that our generation is cynical, the reason I'm cynical, is because we're handed a world in which we see  injustices of the past. The hypocrisy, I mean I guess injustice, also applies in terms of things like the Cold War and stuff. That's why I'm cynical.  I hope that answers your question at least a little bit. I don't know. I feel kind of preachy. Like, this is my position.

 You can, it's corporate espionage. And I'm sure that's going on and I've heard cases of it.  Yeah, well and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they'll find a way around, you know, nobody's found a way to prevent people from getting  in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it. 

Recording: (7288/ 10721) 
 I think that just because you do so, because I know I've done studies and I took some of those classes, and you just think about it that way. I think a lot of these people just say,  The nurse said you take everything for a fact, and I thought that was kind of strange. But I think there are a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that I would want to do it for a while.  as long as I could.

And I mean that's not something that you would think a head coach at Ohio State would say, you know. 

Recording: (7308/ 10721) 
 But I

 that he remembers. He remembers the stepfathers and that kind of thing. It's just not a good stuff. 

Recording: (7310/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7311/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (7312/ 10721) 
 Yeah! Yeah! 

Recording: (7313/ 10721) 
 There's been a lot of problems with him. He's a brilliant kid. They told us in elementary school he had the highest IQ they'd ever had tested. He's very creative.  very talented musically. He was taking lessons from Gene Walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university and he's  said that he thought Charlie had the makings to be a professional, make a living career as a jazz saxophonist.

 I figure that would be plenty. I told my mom I just want green jello. She said you didn't make me snacks. 

Recording: (7319/ 10721) 
 It's just wonderful. I know, like, Saturday we're going to drive to Oberlin to watch Swim 2 events and come back. So, you know, she says, Mom, I'm only going to be in the water five minutes total. Why are you guys driving to Oberlin?  in Ohio for this because we wouldn't miss it. There will be a time when she won't be doing those things. So it's just important and it's wonderful and I just think  it's just such an opportunity. I'm so lucky to be able to do that. See, now like my husband, I'm 11 years older than he is.

Recording: (7324/ 10721) 
 Not to sound like a broken record, but I really think it's our backslide on on family unit  it's I think it's too easy to stay and I've been married and divorced so I've unfortunately had that experience to me that  It's too easy to get divorced. People don't really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that, I don't want to say old 

Recording: (7325/ 10721) 
 Like this push to the right that's sort of going on, hoping it's sort of dying out. But I mean it seemed a little scarier back in like 94, 95.  I think we've reached a point where, because not all of the advances have been 100% successful,  The opposition is criticizing the advance. 

Recording: (7326/ 10721) 
 It's just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming. 

Recording: (7327/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I've heard that too.  It's different. I keep trying to figure out now, was it worse when they were this age or is this worse? Then you can talk to some other people.  people that are all you haven't seen anything yet wait till they just don't even want to be in sight with you and don't wait till they you know I'm not going on vacation with you I can

 I don't think it hurt me not knowing it.

 Government doesn't seem to work too swiftly. 

Recording: (7337/ 10721) 
 Like there'd be kids saying, yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am in class. And then they're out there smoking at the cars or cutting school and stuff.  Yeah. 

Recording: (7338/ 10721) 
 the leaking, you know, ceilings, all of the peeling floors, all of the bad chalkboards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff. And it had the opposite effect of what we thought. People thought the  schools are so bad they said we're not going to support those and they voted no. So the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said you know 18 months later when the board put another  their levy on the ballot. We said, these are great schools. We have great teachers. Look at this kid. He's learning to read. He's made six months improvement

Recording: (7340/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (7341/ 10721) 
 I was going to say, I've seen situations too where I can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to, or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them.  situations they still want them to. They still don't want to go out there and do that. And you know they need to look at each one of those cases too. Because I know there's  and all that kind of thing. And that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife. 

Recording: (7342/ 10721) 
 and 

Recording: (7343/ 10721) 
 That's the way we figured in a few years he'll be fine. It's just getting there. It's been very difficult. I mean, there's times when we didn't know where he was for a week or two.  A week at a time, I was driving Lane Avenue once and saw him begging money on the street. It's a pretty heavy load to go through.  It really is. 

Recording: (7344/ 10721) 
 She just wants to get it over with. 

Recording: (7345/ 10721) 
 I think it's better that if people are get to a point where they can't work it out.  a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and maybe there is some way to work it out. 

Recording: (7346/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7347/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7348/ 10721) 
 So she does not want to take the baby home, so they're arranging some other things. We have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time, but we think  It's going to be too hard for us. 

Recording: (7349/ 10721) 
 Well, and don't you think too that the more they have found out, psychologically speaking, about children and the placement of children in the family,  and the throes of not having enough or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many.  I both know that experience from being one of 11 children raised. So you know you didn't have the advantages that

 Yeah, and I told them I was going to call up the TV station so they could film me crawling out the door as an OSU employee.

 Years ago, there was a Citizen, I don't know if you were, what your background is, where you were here, but Citizen Journal was a daily paper, and it was the opposite of the Dispatch.  It was much more liberal. They used this, it was a morning paper and the dispatch was an afternoon paper, evening paper, and they shared the same facilities.  the same printing presses and everything and then dispatched when their lease expired, wouldn't renew their lease.

Recording: (7357/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you should be well aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now.  So, you know, but you can tell how your child's doing, of course. 

Recording: (7358/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (7359/ 10721) 
 my respect. Oh yeah, but I see everyone is engaging in sinful behavior because  in my religion, everyone sins. I'm a Christian, I go to a non-denominational church.  I don't like the nominations. I'm not 

Recording: (7360/ 10721) 
 because somebody is totally, in my opinion, raising that child. You aren't getting to put your values, your traditions, what's important to you, onto that  child. Now the other girl she just has a 4 month old and has been in daycare for 3 weeks and she's going to quit her job and go to a  working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him.

 You're much bigger and you can control the thing and keep it away from her. Yeah, but I don't want somebody else telling me what they can watch and not watch. That's my job.  But I don't know how, I mean, the media presupposedly, I mean, this may be a way it works, the media  The media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it or whatever, they don't. But it's when it's like the constant barrage that this is what you get, the Monica Lewinsky stuff.

 And I looked at it and I thought, introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader than that. So I ended up coming up with a  class that was only nine weeks, it was only nine classes, so it was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks.  and I ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly and visual art, and for the second three weeks we

 Yeah, we had a, my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds.

 whole time, I was in high school and college and all this kind of thing, but it was just like, people just thought, oh, you are American, you're here, therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around.  and they just sort of don't grasp the fact that you can have made sacrifices to be there.  Also in films, you know, I remember actually being in Bristol in that film California with Brad Pitt and Julie Lewis and you know, they're in the trailer and everything else

And he was a road man, gave his life for 89 tribes to help them find and refine their connection with their spirituality that they'd lost.  because of the missionaries bringing Christianity.

 Uh huh, uh huh. 

Recording: (7377/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7378/ 10721) 
 I was not happy there anyway. Then took a couple months off and did some consulting, worked on a consulting project at a board  wardens for about six months. And then when that project ended, just at the same time it ended, my father-in-law was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer.  and he needed daily treatments here in Columbus and they were from Chillicothe. So I became his caregiver for about three months until he died. 

Recording: (7379/ 10721) 
 It is. 

Recording: (7380/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7381/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

 Ah. 

Recording: (7383/ 10721) 
 Right! 

Recording: (7384/ 10721) 
 Well, the thing is, there's things you can't explain. 

Recording: (7385/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, it used to be when I first started teaching, even up to sixth grade, kids were pretty respectful. 

Recording: (7386/ 10721) 
 That's because it's kind of like warm and tropical. That's why they like it down there. 

Recording: (7387/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7388/ 10721) 
 as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do. So I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, when you come down to these things, there's...  People with mental illness and with a disability are trying to pawn off the responsibility onto everybody but themselves.  if they would have seen this guy and given him medication he wouldn't have went out there and killed somebody. You know shoulda woulda coulda man. If the guy stopped taking his

 his and I want to use the word opinion, but I know that's not right if he swayed them with a position that he had developed  Now, that's not necessarily his opinion, that's what I'm trying to make a point there, but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from  of various people within his community, whether you're talking about a township or a county, state, whatever it may be.

 No, not really. I mean, I would have preferred it, of course, and I would have preferred that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did. But no, I'm  I'm very happy and content with her decision.  And ironically, Julie, Tulsa, she and her husband, both Baptists, they have both their children in a Catholic prep school. Yeah, kindergarten and preschool.

 You have a preference at five or six, but by the time you turn eight, one of your hemispheres has pretty much decided it's going to be the one that runs the show.  And that's when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture. So.

 I am a, it's kind of a unique position, I guess my job title is a senior research associate.  I received my bachelor's, master's, PhD, and nurse practitioner all from here, from OSU. And I'm working down at Dodd Hall in a research position. I'm also a nurse practitioner.  down there that sees patients in follow-up and in clinic.

 I think it was just starting when I was still playing the stuff.  Can't really take her with you. Yeah, you can't get her in. You can't get her in. You have to be 18.  to get into dance clubs now.

 I don't know, I haven't really formed an opinion. 

Recording: (7415/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7416/ 10721) 
 But obviously you would try to steer them more in whichever direction they're most suited for, as far as maybe the volunteer work, because there's so much volunteer work.  volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you don't have, you know, if you're lacking in whatever way, you think  that you can, you know, there is something, you know, hopefully that, I don't know.

 We develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish beings, not to the sacrifice of what we should be doing.  mortal and we're all going to be in that and I'm not saying no one makes those errors, makes errors, it's always there. The problem is to try to stay focused.  on that. Not to jump ship. You know what they say in this country? If you don't like it, leave it.

 So, I mean, basically the entire winter I'd either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends.  The whole reason I quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight. I was really starting to feel it physically.

 So that's all the required. I'm thinking about taking some extra anyway, just because I like it.

 I was like, okay, all right, what are the advantages? And he's like, dude, let's just put it on your computer. So I'm like, all right, fine, I don't care. So we put it on my computer and I've had nothing but problems since.  I don't know how anyone can run 2000 if they don't know what they're doing. I'm trying to find drivers. Because I've had to find drivers for everything.  Yeah, and also it's directed towards businesses. It's NT technology, which is designed for network businesses and well anyways, it's got a

 Oh, we do too, we make vegetable soup and chili.

 If we ran sports, I mean the game of sports, not the administration. The administration of sports is just as unethical as the business world. It is unethical.  and it's one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we've emphasized sports along with a theater as being, oh, the way to go.  and the poorest benchmarks you could have in terms of financial appreciation. Sure, the thing is you

 Yeah.

 Just different stuff. It's different every day. That's why I like it. Just like with you talking to people, it's different every day. 

Recording: (7457/ 10721) 
 I think more along the lines of physical abuse would be crossing the line.  like  I can't say that I would vote for anyone like that but I mean just like small things like that where it doesn't really 

Recording: (7458/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we do office parties and everything like yesterday we had to go to an attorney's firm and just fruit and cookies and people tend to  have food more and more, you can't believe, gourmet lunches and things, a lot more than they did, let's say, 10 years ago. 

Recording: (7459/ 10721) 
 Oh, that would be awesome. 

Recording: (7460/ 10721) 
 And for just a poor little wife and a small baby on that was kind of tough going. 

Recording: (7461/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I don't do a whole lot of it, but I like to travel. 

Recording: (7462/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7463/ 10721) 
 You have to take a foundation of courses.

 No more than five because there's a specific, it's called the five paragraph essay. The first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion.  and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea. So I'm teaching all my kids right now. 

Recording: (7468/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7469/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7470/ 10721) 
 Mhm.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7472/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7473/ 10721) 
 I did. 

Recording: (7474/ 10721) 
 that maybe if it would have stayed small, maybe I could notice some kind of difference that way, but I never, I haven't noticed anything. 

Recording: (7475/ 10721) 
 Oh, that's almost as bad as Rosie cozy. I have a 

Recording: (7476/ 10721) 
 all of them that come over to the house, if they get bored, they'll go over to that bookcase and start looking for something to read. So it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent.  Now however, my one son's gone too far. He's got one room completely lined with books. And a hallway full of books. And I don't know if the kids ever go and pick those up or not because they're always going to the library.  So you see it's what is taught at home that really counts, but we don't need all those material things and I'm sitting back and thinking well, which one? 

Recording: (7477/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (7478/ 10721) 
 What do I want out of life? 

Recording: (7479/ 10721) 
 Well, I'd assume you'd be running it that whole time. 

Recording: (7480/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7481/ 10721) 
 It might. Good teachers do that. I still get upset. When I was teaching school, I did activity-based teaching.  and I was doing some volunteer work at Dublin schools, which is supposed to be one of the better schools in the area. And I thought there'd be all sorts of creative things going on and there wasn't. It was still read the chapter, write the answers to the questions.  at the end of the book and I thought, how boring. I mean, there are different ways to get kids turned on to things. I'm not sure there's so much influence.  to 

Recording: (7482/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7483/ 10721)

Recording: (7484/ 10721) 
 Okay, good, because I don't think I'd know that one. Whatever looks pretty when it comes out. 

Recording: (7485/ 10721) 
 You know at lunchtime they'd be cutting their next class. You know there's two different lunchtimes. Sometimes they just alternate and take two lunches or  go to one class, go to one lunch, and skip after then. 

Recording: (7486/ 10721) 
 Well, I'm lucky in that way because I get to travel a lot. And so if there's something I really want to see, Chicago's not that far. Washington's not that far.  New York, you know, I don't get to New York that often, but, you know, I mean, I can, I still have access to a lot of stuff if I want to go to the trouble. 

Recording: (7487/ 10721) 
 Um, well, maybe not Columbus in particular. But I don't know, I was, I think I was just a little burnt  out because I was doing the two majors and I had a heavy course load every quarter and I had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so I had done seven straight quarters and I'm sure that  attitude. I had a lot of hard classes and I was just tired of Ohio State and tired of being here and red tape. 

Recording: (7488/ 10721) 
 their daycare? I don't know. It's tough. I think really I believe more in that large corporations need to  have some kind of daycare offered. It's just there's not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one-income family. I mean, you know, we could do it, you know.  But we wouldn't live as nice as we do. We wouldn't have as nice of cars as we do. We'd struggle a little more. So it's a toss-up. It's a real...

I mean, just like right there were just like cakes, cupcakes, cookies, like everything just right in front of you with like all this Halloween stuff on.  All the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it's such a money making, you know, and it's so over the top.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (7506/ 10721) 
 basically because the plans which the utilities had for our locations they could not provide to us because of the divestiture ruling. So we had to go out  and do our own surveys, become self-educated through courses, through ATT and through Purdue University it was, I think OU had some courses.  and ultimately the university here now has a major telecommunication group.

 whatever they feel. I mean if they feel comfortable with being like that that's fine but I don't know I don't know if I would talk about the  But maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they're like, well, what should I do?

 No, I didn't know anybody in high school, but in college I know some people that have used coke. Ecstasy.  It was more after the movie go

 they don't have auditions, they just take anybody that wants to play. And if you take a string player that can't play in tune, it can really wreck everything.  Yeah, but I think we've improved a lot. We gave a concert a couple weeks ago at a church in Upper Arlington.  And I thought it went pretty well. A wind piece, a little bit of Mozart, some concertos.

 Yes you are! You're saying you don't need to have a leader in a family. And if I'm going to be a leader, I'm going to be the one. I'm going to be the one, not the sperm bank.

 because again I said you get wisdom from that as long as you're listening to them. Some people, I don't care what their age is, they just blow them off.  So that, plus you have the, I think, an understanding of the schooling that came from.  Um... 

Recording: (7529/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7530/ 10721) 
 But I think kids in high school and stuff, some of them, like my brother-in-law's gay. And when I met him, I knew he was. You know, he was the type, some of them you  can't tell, it doesn't matter what they look like. But my husband said all through growing up, he liked men. He didn't like girls. He looked at magazines,  means, you know, all this stuff. And I thought that's so funny because growing up I just didn't know anybody that was. But, you know, he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning. 

Recording: (7531/ 10721) 
 My bill collectors are the ones that are scared of that. 

Recording: (7532/ 10721) 
 But just that freedom, you know, to do what you want, to get some sleep, to eat, to take care of yourself, to do a little investigation on your own, to pray about it, whatnot.  it's really clear, but if you don't get that, and you're always thrust back into it, I don't think you can break free.

 I remember a time when I was a brand new teacher, I was maybe fifth or sixth year of teaching. That's still pretty new. I said, John, what's your last name?  name?" He said, guess. I said, I don't feel like guessing. Tell me your last name. He said, guess. I said, John, I want to know your last name. And he said,  G-U-E-S-S. I'm like, oh, sorry. Thank you. 

Recording: (7535/ 10721) 
 No, no, no, it's not. You can do whatever you want. I've heard conferences where the, I've heard the prophet talk about how you  should keep in touch with the people that you served and or the people that you worked with and that you knew and that they, even if they can't, you can't remember how to speak.  just try and send them a letter. And I've been really bad about that, so I feel a lot of pressure to, I need to, I mean it's, I just don't want to lose contact with them.

Recording: (7548/ 10721) 
 because the priest they had there wouldn't let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion. And that's pretty much the priest decides that. And he felt singled out.  And he was, he was the only one, and he was uncomfortable with it. But it hasn't been a problem.  person myself, but I'm not against it. And maybe I've justified it to myself by saying, well, they're teaching values. 

Recording: (7549/ 10721) 
 I'm guessing. 

Recording: (7550/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7551/ 10721) 
 And I suggest the shot, the Depo-Provero, because that's what I'm on now. And that way you don't miss any pills that last for three months, you know.  And that's what I would suggest for her, you know. 

Recording: (7552/ 10721) 
 No, the prompts are only given out that day. Even the teachers don't know what they're going to be. And it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood, or it might be something as specific as,  as when you were little what toy was your most favorite and you have to write five paragraphs on it.  I don't know. 

Recording: (7553/ 10721) 
 And I don't think that it is just executed properly. So I would almost rather have it not at all. 

Recording: (7554/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (7555/ 10721) 
 Oh, yeah.

 My husband lived in a small town in southern Ohio where the dentists in town were three brothers and they were named Pain, Pain, and Pain dentists.  in. There's some funny name stories out there boy. But people just go nuts with their kids names.  I just like, would you wanna, why'd you do that to that kid? Carol Harold.  I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (7565/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you're a professional and your wife's a professional. That's how you're evaluating it? On both of us? Yes. I said I don't want to do business with you.  Why? I'm going to give you a loan. I don't want to do business with you because you didn't ask me about my goals. My goals was not to  to have my wife work because nowadays it takes two of them to work. I'm wondering when they're going to get child labor law to revoke that because

 Oh my gosh. 

Recording: (7567/ 10721) 
 which is not a lot. 

Recording: (7568/ 10721) 
 She didn't say anything. I mean, they wouldn't let her. 

Recording: (7569/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well I think basically that goes back to the parenting and everything.  something missing in the child's life, that he wasn't getting perhaps attention.  Those kids in particular I don't Understand how they could be building bombs and in their basement mom and dad not know where 

Recording: (7570/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, we'd like to garden and that was one of the things too. We want some space to to make a bigger garden and  No, we kind of help my neighbor out, he's got a big garden next door, so we help him, he's retired.  Oh. 

Recording: (7571/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7572/ 10721) 
 not specifically, no. Sometimes little groups, sometimes if there's a college in a community when I was running a school levy campaign,  We would try to get them either registered and active in a campaign, but it was very difficult. It was sort of like getting people who live in  in a trailer park active in voting. There's certain little blocks of people. And on school levies, the people who voted no, which were senior citizens,

 to get them to do what they do to even help blind people or to help people that have other physical disabilities.  You can tell from the way the dog is in terms of the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability.  uh... they've been trained for uh... you can tell whether they've been treat train the right way or whatever so 

Recording: (7574/ 10721) 
 things that typically women do because that's my job. That's my trade-off. You know, I don't have to go someplace else. I can get, I can go and have coffee every day with my daughters. I  I can go do whatever I want and I'm happy to do these other things.

 views on a lot of things. It's dry, they have real strict visitation policies, things like that. My thought is if you're  If you're considered an adult enough to move away, then you shouldn't have that many restrictions. I can understand some because I remember when I was a freshman in college, we did crazy things, but still. 

Recording: (7580/ 10721) 
 What's different is my old neighborhood is just exactly the same. And so from that angle, I mean, still is my elementary school sitting there. I went to for nine years.  and then north is not being used as a high school, but it's there a block away, Olentangy Village. I'm right in where I always was. I mean, I was raised on Como Avenue.  and I live two blocks away from there now. So I made a full circle there, but Columbus has changed in the downtown area, and it is really neat. 

Recording: (7581/ 10721) 
 and I didn't even want to, you know, and I knew my mom, it's like if she can save a nickel somewhere, you know, she will. So I knew that that's how they were and I didn't want to, you know, it was my choice to get married, it was my choice to have  kids and you know I didn't I didn't feel the need to ask them well I think

Recording: (7583/ 10721) 
 You know, it's a real word and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you're going, oh, jeez, are we doing the right thing?  thing. But some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it and we're just like I don't think we could have ever dreamed  up all this stuff, you know, and, you know, kept them entertained all day long by ourselves, you know. There's no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids, you know. 

Recording: (7584/ 10721) 
 I ever would have before. 

Recording: (7585/ 10721) 
 Bruges in Belgium. So I have a game going on with a good friend of mine named Michelle. I have this stupid ring here. You see the ring? So I have lost some  something like two incarnations of this ring just flat out lost them because well I'm an irresponsible cuss. And one of them, a third if you will,  I gave to her. 

Recording: (7586/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7587/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (7588/ 10721) 
 Yeah, the near west side has always been a pretty bad area. Well, in the last 40 or 50 years and it's starting to creep west. 

Recording: (7589/ 10721) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (7590/ 10721)

Recording: (7592/ 10721) 
 They're trying. It just doesn't seem like they're thinking ahead. 

Recording: (7593/ 10721) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (7594/ 10721) 
 Oh, I know it. I know it. That's really what's hard. 

Recording: (7595/ 10721) 
 None whatsoever. 

Recording: (7596/ 10721) 
 and I mean it's basically anytime I have free I mean it's not like I have a set schedule of when I have to work and things like that it's just whenever I feel like I have to do it. 

Recording: (7597/ 10721) 
 civil rights only went so far. They haven't corrected the wrongs in the past. They haven't created  a sense in our society that anyone can achieve. Like the American dream in my opinion is an absolute lie.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (7599/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yep. 

Recording: (7600/ 10721)

 Catholic schools. 

Recording: (7618/ 10721) 
 kind of crime or anything. I know they send them back, but I just think that we're just too open with that and there's got to be a line to say this is as many people as  I mean, I know that's hard, and it's hard to draw the line, but then other countries, if it's so miserable there, then they need to work  on their country. 

Recording: (7619/ 10721) 
 as much as she could. We were poor, but we managed.

 You know, they talk about drinking from the fountain. Now they're only gargling. They're not drinking much. By the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade, they're pretty savvy.  these days. They're not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do. 

Recording: (7632/ 10721) 
 You know what I mean? Yeah. I don't know what you mean. Play dumb. Pull it out of them. What do you mean? Michael Red, what do you plan on doing after school?  When I was growing up they used to give the grade point average and the major of the student athlete. 

Recording: (7633/ 10721) 
 I have just the same opinion I think most people have as a TV. 

Recording: (7634/ 10721) 
 Yeah, so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an 80 IQ for example and you know he's not going to get all the details and the battles and the years and the  names, but you just wanted to get the overall gist of the French and American War was about this time in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted.  just the main concepts. Well there's the kid that you say, Todd, you study for the test and when you come in I'll let you answer anything on the test you know.

 Really? 

Recording: (7637/ 10721) 
 E... okay. 

Recording: (7638/ 10721) 
 Right. Well, and I'm right now I'm 45 years old, so I've lived in or around Columbus for most  of 44 years, excluding times when I was away at school. 

Recording: (7639/ 10721) 
 in my own home. I've been a collector. Now I take this back to the depression years when I didn't have anything and my father one time when he was out of work, guess what? I  I don't know what welfare agency it was, but they brought us our Christmas dinner and the first doll baby I ever had. And I remember when I tried to wash the thing off, that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water.  Well if you don't know how to take care of it any better than that I'll never buy you another one and believe me she didn't. 

Recording: (7640/ 10721) 
 I mean, I had parents that everything I did was negative. I mean, they just told me I couldn't do this, couldn't do that. And so what I try to do is when anything comes up, I always think of how my parents would handle it.  and I do 180 degrees. I sort of feel I'm mentally okay now, but I don't know how I got here because I've been there.  way, you know, and it's, you know. 

Recording: (7641/ 10721) 
 I'm concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely. I feel it's absolutely essential that we have penalties.  we have for everyone, for everyone, really across the board. We are getting away from penalty, we're getting away from penalty.  But so many people, just to give an example, talking about adults, I just read a statistic 

Recording: (7642/ 10721) 
 they're supposed to do and all that reminds me of a joke I gotta tell this maybe this is off the record but I read it in Reader's Digest the other day and it said about this little the mother  was trying to teach a child how to put the clothes away. She said go put it in a hamper and a kid looked at her like it's crazy. Hamper, hamper. Well you know where where daddy and mommy never put our  clothes when we take them off. And the kid immediately took his clothes and threw them down by the side of daddy's bed. 

Recording: (7643/ 10721)

 Aren't there other important roles? Where would those nuns be? Where would your mother possibly have been if she went to Catholic school, I take it? Where would she have been if it weren't for the nuns?  Why we put nuns down? Hey, they worked a lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for.  And they had a very important role for your development, even though your generation is removed.

 in the federal government to collect occupational data. We were kind of a conduit for the state for that.  They wanted an hourly rate. They didn't want a range. They wanted a number, and that was gospel. But it's based on survey data, and there's always  statistical error in there and stuff and try to explain that. We spent more time when people call and give information explaining this is what this really means.

There's the human rights for the mother, but what about the human rights for the child's life? I think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases.

 I got on birth control probably when I was like 16 or 17. But still, I didn't take the pills all the time and, you know, that wasn't very good for me.  Or maybe neither.

 The university never has money. That's like me when I first came here. The university was not paying me nothing. I worked two jobs for 10 years while I was here, the first 10 years, just to make a living.

 Hmm. 

Recording: (7720/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and I had stalled with it. I knew that what had to happen on the outside, which is really only some minor painting, painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the  front yard and then we have there's a guy who works for me who's um I just don't know how he can how he makes a living because he's very very reasonable he's also very loyal to me he's done stuff for me for years  And he's not that old. He's probably 28 or 29 now. But anyhow, Pat went in. We added a bathroom. There was a mudroom. We added a half bath off the floor.

 You really need to start teaching what I call the older values, but good values, I don't care whether they're old or new.  But good values, and I think we really need to have that established within our educational system. Starting in the elementary, right on up through college.  I think there ought to be a number of courses that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can

 No, humans are violent by nature, I believe. I mean, people have been at war since the beginning of man. It's more or less  It's not greed that causes violence. It's not media. Just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do.  TV's showing you violence that you could do if you're driven to it.

 don't say oh your son's gonna be gay he's two right now let's you know change this so it so it doesn't come out to be  a problem or whatever, but I think they need to leave that to the decision of the people.

And I would feel  feel better for them and if they used it because it's not good for the children that are born, it's not good for them.  I'd prefer abstinence, but let's be realistic.

 Basically, it's just the talk and stuff. It's not like, you know what I mean?  I'm black, I'm better, or I'm white, I'm better. It's none of that. 

Recording: (7743/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7744/ 10721) 
 I like this stuff as opposed to sitting around and playing computer games, first of all, because it's more interesting. It's a lot more practical.  It's a little more problem solving, less running around and shooting things. It's like problem solving, little puzzles.  It's not as much sit in front of a TV and be entertained. It's you create your own entertainment. 

Recording: (7745/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, I think it's real important to really get a good feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that. They have to really match.  And if they don't, then it's not ever going to work because there's always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing. So I think it's real important.  and there's no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that's the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we

 I knew we wouldn't go into this conversation too far before it came in.  It's interesting coming from a small, more rural area, coming to the city, because people have this idea of a community.  You're going to go to the city where all these terrible things are. Dance clubs, drugs, homosexuals. And you're going to go the other direction. You're going to lose your face.  Yeah.

 I have no idea. I remember where I was too in the Columbine shooting because my friends and I were sitting around drinking a few beers and we were channel surfing. And we see that kid fall out  the window and we're like oh my god what is going on so we just left it on it was quite like it was disturbing because I like I was recently out of high school myself and like sure there were fights  and stuff, but it was always like you could avoid them or you know what I mean?

 with the little girl sitting there going, mama, you need to go help seven, like seven nine times nine, 63, you know, per timetables and stuff, you know.

You're wasted you screwed up your life you're gonna you're so screwed up your kids, you know, I Was 20 miles 31 when Devin was born so 

Recording: (7865/ 10721) 
 Oh, there always has been. There always has been. I think a lot of people feel that kids, a lot of kids are on medication today that shouldn't be.  But I think that's the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that, like for example, when we refer kids in  Worthington to a doctor, we have a list of three doctors that we work with. And we know that they won't just give this kid a pill if he doesn't have eight out of the 12 symptoms or 

Recording: (7866/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm.

Recording: (7868/ 10721) 
 I guess I'm just so secure about who I am that I don't have a problem with it. And I was in the men's glee club for a while, so there's a small percentage of the people in there  that are gay as well. I really made friends with a lot of them. I guess it's just because of my personality.  I really don't know what it is, but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says, come, hey, you can be my friend. I'm cool. I'm all right, even though I'm not one of 

Recording: (7869/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7870/ 10721) 
 That was grade school. 

Recording: (7871/ 10721) 
 So that's frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think, I don't want either one of these people. There should be a none of the above. If there is that option, I'm sure a lot more.

 I can't believe you came back.

 I was born in Los Angeles, California in the mid-50s. When I was less than one year old, my family moved to Columbus.  The first place we lived in Columbus was in Whitehall near the corner of Hamilton and Rode. Then shortly after that we moved out to Reynoldsburg.  I lived there until my sophomore year in high school.

 I don't believe that.

 I mean, that's another thing that I'm at odds with my parents, is that they don't understand the fact that why would I go to college? I paid for it myself.  my way through school. I was so proud of the fact that I was like only a quarter late than my actual schedule to graduate, which is pretty amazing given the fact that I was paying for it as I went  And I didn't have any loans. When I was done, it was paid for. And so, of course, tuition was $125 a quarter, but I was only making, you know, 50 cents a month.

 Right, right, right.

 What I've liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it's not right and that is wrong. I mean there was the episode

 I remember when I first started going to the Unitarian Church up here on  Well, when I was in Sunday school. We drove there from Reynoldsburg by going up, I think, Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road.  up to Morse Road and then over on Morse Road to High Street. So it was on the back roads, you know. And that was before the mid-'60s.

 Oh, no.

 The reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it's an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate  in that were very, very high people. And it was mostly, of course, young people, but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly  searching for answers and I mean their questions and their conversations. Talk about opinions.

 But I want them to do that to me. And I think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and TV programs instead of what they're showing right now.  I think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and long to the politicians that they stopped saying now What's really best for the general public? Instead of what we think to make our  ourselves look great. 

Recording: (7929/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's a qualitative type analysis. 

Recording: (7930/ 10721) 
 I don't really think there's any huge difference. I can say from what I've seen, the people  Catholic schools. They are a little bit more disciplined and know how to organize their time better and things like that. Most of my friends have gone to the public  schools are really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here.

 I think the news media have hyped it up too much, really. I mean, we have an accord with Cuba that says anyone that's trying to escape from Cuba to the United States that's found at sea is immediately  to Cuba. Whether you agree with it or not, that's the accord and that's what Castro's, that's the premise he's operating on.  In the news media, they haven't been real objective about it.

 I think Columbus is really interesting how it develops compared to, I don't know, just how Indianapolis, how Columbus is a  a real standard Midwest city, just how it's designed and laid out compared to Philadelphia, or just when it was settled and when it was made, just how more of the streets are more  It's all like planned out more as opposed to like in in Philly or places like that more East Coast. It's like the roads Parts of them are real small and

 Our engineers are techies and are really into this.  in the forefront of Ohio government. Along with the technology, there has to also be the paperwork. Now I don't realize we have a paperless environment.  quote-unquote 

Recording: (7937/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7938/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (7939/ 10721) 
 Well, I lived on 12th maybe about four or five years ago. Probably longer, but that was just for a summer thing. After I saw the couches being burned, I said,  I said, shoo. No, you're all right.

 I think there might be, but I think most of them are a dying breed. They're the older citizens. Many in my generation, they'd probably be  I'm the first of the baby boom. That's when the women's movement started. Many men still haven't accepted that.  for the generations, even the later baby boom generations behind me. When I talk to them, I talk to high school students or even young college students. 

Recording: (7941/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7942/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7943/ 10721) 
 But I think it should be an option. I'm really for women's rights and everything because I was single for so long and I just feel if a man could have a  I think that if we had a child, it would be different, but since women are the only ones that can, then it ultimately should be our choice. I really do.  available, especially when you're young. No girl should have to go through pregnancy and everything, even if it's a mistake or whatever. I just, you know. 

Recording: (7944/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7945/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7946/ 10721) 
 And I think there's a whole bunch of people that just don't want to spend any extra money on anything. We're already paying for enough of things. We don't want to do this. 

Recording: (7947/ 10721) 
 The first year they made it in-state only. The second class that they're going to be starting, they have some people from Michigan, I think. 

Recording: (7948/ 10721) 
 Yeah, real bad and it was, you know, mainly no one talked about it. 

Recording: (7949/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (7950/ 10721) 
 I can feed them and I can get them. So that's how our life is. Mr. Mom. 

Recording: (7951/ 10721) 
 Well, my question is, who's more important on the basketball team? The five starters or the six men coming off the bench? I ask you, who? Ask George Reese.  Is he less important this year than he was last year? 

Recording: (7952/ 10721) 
 No, I just like it anyway. I like their culture a lot. 

Recording: (7953/ 10721) 
 Yeah, so, and a lot of people turn 18 when they're in high school, so I'm sure they can go get one there. 

Recording: (7954/ 10721) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (7955/ 10721) 
 could turn back right now. I don't know. 

Recording: (7956/ 10721) 
 My favorite character on that show had always been Chakotay and I don't like how his character  I like the fact that he was someone who had been a Starfleet officer  But because of a matter of principle, I left Starfleet, joined the Maquis, but was still fundamentally an honorable person. 

Recording: (7957/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7958/ 10721) 
 No. What really, when AIDS started, I had a, one of my best friend's brother had died of it. And that really,  After that, I was like, I have to work on them. Because I was scared to death to get AIDS. So I did work on them.  probably after a few years of having sex without condoms, but 

Recording: (7959/ 10721) 
 to be something that's going to make them change? What is it going to be and how are  realistic is it for, you know, what percentage? I mean, I don't know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that, but...  I mean, I do think if there is that element of choice, it's a lot different than the government saying, okay, this is your cutoff limit. 

Recording: (7960/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, me either. 

Recording: (7961/ 10721) 
 Convenient. 

Recording: (7962/ 10721) 
 So you know now that's just like they consider that like urban. 

Recording: (7963/ 10721) 
 I think it would probably, I think it would be certainly interesting. 

Recording: (7964/ 10721) 
 I mean 

Recording: (7965/ 10721) 
 I'm a professor, I'm doing studies here. 

Recording: (7966/ 10721) 
 I was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up as I was.  But there were a lot of them that were. 

Recording: (7967/ 10721) 
 Everybody's living longer, there's more medical things where people can be healed from things that they couldn't be healed from. So everybody today is living longer.  living basically as today as their future were back 30 years ago, I mean when I was a kid, you know, I mean I wasn't really thinking about today, I mean I was thinking  about tomorrow. 

Recording: (7968/ 10721) 
 Like, I don't know. It's like it's really serious and it's really not serious. Like, it's everything I guess. 

Recording: (7969/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7970/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7971/ 10721) 
 Oh, OK. It doesn't have the equalizer thingy. 

Recording: (7972/ 10721) 
 all by yourself. 

Recording: (7973/ 10721) 
 I think I would say the same thing because of course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving.  learned a lot from her selflessness and 

Recording: (7974/ 10721) 
 If you come from a situation like that, that doesn't mean you have to be like that. Do you know what I mean? 

Recording: (7975/ 10721) 
 Really? 

Recording: (7976/ 10721) 
 Relations, but they're normal people outside of their homosexuality. I mean, it's nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (7977/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (7978/ 10721) 
 I just go back and copycat something she said, picking up that child and cuddling it and having that  baby touch your skin and teaching what love is. You don't necessarily  necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel. That child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother, little brother, 

Recording: (7979/ 10721) 
 Oh, I think that's good. 

Recording: (7980/ 10721) 
 I said, are you kidding me? I studied the weather and I know about it. You're going to tell me that fog pushed that two-foot pine tree across the way? I mean,  And it was a thick tree too. And we get up to the next gas station, he fills up and I listen on  the intercom they had news on there weather and stuff tornado warning in that County I turned around I said now see who's the 

Recording: (7981/ 10721) 
 I can see that, like I said, for me, I kind of stay where I am. It's not that I really travel out into some of those other areas more.  affect me personally. Maybe that's bad. I don't know. Maybe I should feel guilty about that. 

Recording: (7982/ 10721) 
 you know, we'll take that as an insult. 

Recording: (7983/ 10721) 
 I don't even know what to say, what a disgrace. It's just embarrassing, it really is. 

Recording: (7984/ 10721) 
 I think of it as a big city. Having been to other big cities, it feels more like that than small towns, which I've also been to, of course. 

Recording: (7985/ 10721) 
 made to face their guilt and what they've done. And a lot of them don't. They say that hardened criminals, real hard  will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to, they need to. 

Recording: (7986/ 10721) 
 No, not really. I mean, different cultures and everything. I went to school with blacks, so I mean, that wasn't that big a thing, except for the in-plugged  of the, you know, I didn't realize how many were being drafted or being enlisted into the service at the time and everything, or how many actually were even in the country, you know. 

Recording: (7987/ 10721) 
 See, the thing is, ideally, I would rather, if I were going to buy houses in Clintonville, to hold them and rent them. My problem is, I don't have any money, so that down payment  has to be 10% down. So that means I would have that tied up while I was being rented. Like we bought a couple condos over on Bethel Road for my kids to live in so my oldest girl  When she was getting ready to move out, she was like 24, and they couldn't find any place to live that I felt was safe and that was acceptable. 

Recording: (7988/ 10721) 
 Well they only keep them there for a day or so and then they try to intervene with their family and put them back with their family.  Maybe call in Children's Services and I just really don't think much of Children's Services. So 

Recording: (7989/ 10721) 
 and  there and they have to deal with it. 

Recording: (7990/ 10721) 
 to get them thinking about it. Then they'll start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it, they'll start getting more and more into it. 

Recording: (7991/ 10721) 
 The herbs. The herbs. 

Recording: (7992/ 10721) 
 Nah, we're just both having to work there. 

Recording: (7993/ 10721) 
 My roommate. 

Recording: (7994/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, I might be wrong, but you know we can't go backwards on that. I don't think you can only work on your own 

Recording: (7995/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Of course, you know, babies tend not to be on time. 

Recording: (7996/ 10721) 
 at 9, 30, 10 o'clock here in Columbus. And that's so cool. I love going out clubbing at like 2 o'clock in the morning.  Red Zone, they open up at 9 or 10 o'clock depending on if they have a special show coming in or not. But that's the place I really like going.  up until usually 2.30, 2 o'clock, all depends. I also found something fascinating. I came 

Recording: (7997/ 10721) 
 I could fire them because they're gay. I could care less. 

Recording: (7998/ 10721) 
 T 

Recording: (7999/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8000/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8001/ 10721) 
 Yeah I have two other sisters. One of them is, well it's funny because we're all divorced. Out of the five of us we're all on, one of them is on her third marriage and we're all on  our second, except for one, she's divorced and she hasn't remarried. And then my oldest, I told you in Akron, I guess she's not remarried. 

Recording: (8002/ 10721) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (8003/ 10721) 
 And then when I got my master's, no I did it during the weekends and the summer.  summers and the nights and it took me about, well I started teaching in 1970, 71.  you 

Recording: (8004/ 10721) 
 And research and stuff like that to do a lot of things that were done years ago 

Recording: (8005/ 10721) 
 But it's really. 

Recording: (8006/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (8007/ 10721) 
 We were inseparable from probably two weeks after we met. I haven't been without him. 

Recording: (8008/ 10721) 
 you know my husband and I were just talking about this I was saying I'm not in for the  you know, George Orwell, 1984, and Big Brother Syndrome and all. My ideal situation would be that  somebody decides who should have kids and who's not but I don't think God's gonna come down and do that so you know what I mean we can't really decide that but to be 

Recording: (8009/ 10721) 
 Yeah, we lived, we moved about five or six years ago. And the house we had before was some big like 80, 90 year old house. 

Recording: (8010/ 10721) 
 I got him sounds like I bought a dog. 

Recording: (8011/ 10721) 
 Yeah, my best friend lives outside Canberra and she has a lot of medical problems. 

Recording: (8012/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it worked out fine for us. 

Recording: (8013/ 10721) 
 They use drugs, but not to the extreme that college students do. 

Recording: (8014/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah. 

Recording: (8015/ 10721) 
 Cooper, I just don't see him ever hugging the guys or saying great job or anything. 

Recording: (8016/ 10721) 
 to the hub, which of course eliminated downtime. But with that, we were not in a position to monitor traffic. 

Recording: (8017/ 10721) 
 and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines. 

Recording: (8018/ 10721) 
 All right. 

Recording: (8019/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (8020/ 10721) 
 And he did that too. 

Recording: (8021/ 10721) 
 San Diego is probably why. Yeah, I've heard that's a nice place. 

Recording: (8022/ 10721) 
 I mean, soon, like, FedEx and all that's probably going to be, there's probably going to be no one working there. They're probably going to make it all machinery, you know. 

Recording: (8023/ 10721) 
 Because I wasn't allowed to wear jeans. I wasn't allowed to wear tennis shoes. 

Recording: (8024/ 10721) 
 I mean, that was a different time, you know, so nowadays it's a lot different, you know. 

Recording: (8025/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (8026/ 10721) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (8027/ 10721) 
 period and it's a long process. I mean this has been going on for 200 years this way. And people are suspicious of government asking questions. 

Recording: (8028/ 10721) 
 Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, besides our time's probably up. I don't know. 

Recording: (8029/ 10721) 
 We pay like 40 or 50 here. Oh yeah. Well, there's like, you take federal and state and all that and I don't know. 

Recording: (8030/ 10721) 
 Yeah, if she passed 100 people and 99 of them said, oh, that's really pretty hair. Oh, those are nice earrings. Oh, that's a nice shirt. Those are nice pants. And one guy goes, what's with that lipstick?  She will remember that what's with that lipstick for about a month and I'm like gosh, you know, you know, and it's sad 

Recording: (8031/ 10721) 
 Okay, so you're higher up there than I would be. 

Recording: (8032/ 10721) 
 Definitely. Yeah. Like I said, I don't have parts, no different. 

Recording: (8033/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha 

Recording: (8034/ 10721) 
 How'd you do this to me? 

Recording: (8035/ 10721) 
 There's a lot. We need to do a lot of evolving. We definitely do. 

Recording: (8036/ 10721) 
 Does that mean? 

Recording: (8037/ 10721) 
 mhm 

Recording: (8038/ 10721) 
 I did have a job like that when I worked full time. 

Recording: (8039/ 10721) 
 Does your husband like that? 

Recording: (8040/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's difficult. 

Recording: (8041/ 10721) 
 I think that's bullshit. 

Recording: (8042/ 10721) 
 The Cowboys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (8043/ 10721) 
 Subjective, right? 

Recording: (8044/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8045/ 10721) 
 and so it became a part of everyday life. And the more you see something, the more it becomes more acceptable. So maybe that is how  having an effect. Maybe 50 years from now we'll look back on those TV programs and think they were trendsetting instead of stereotypical. But I'm sure it does have  of some influence because I think it did, it wasn't the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces 

Recording: (8046/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8047/ 10721) 
 to move forward in my life. Now what happened with the chill was, you know, there was, I had a friend that  work for them so they didn't know that and he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to  installed, supposed to have installed that was five feet higher, three to five feet higher. And shoulda, woulda, coulda, you know, if it 

Recording: (8048/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well... 

Recording: (8049/ 10721) 
 I don't know. I think, I really don't know. I think in today's world, what they call the  that it's just like everything has changed. Like when I grew up, we kids that grew up, when we grew up and everything else, we had standards and there were certain things  we did or didn't do. And then it came along that when our kids grew up, then there were so many things that changed. One thing that stands out, and this has nothing to do with politics, 

Recording: (8050/ 10721) 
 Like I said, it'd just be the old generations with the black president, where now it'd be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it.  I think that'd be a bigger number. 

Recording: (8051/ 10721) 
 He's, well, yeah. 

Recording: (8052/ 10721) 
 Well, one of the things I'm doing is I'm applying for a number of research grants to go to Germany and continue my research. So hopefully I'll get one of those.  I think I'm in pretty good shape to get one of those. So that might cause me to put off grad school for a year, but I don't think that grad school  will mind if I 

Recording: (8053/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8054/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (8055/ 10721) 
 What do you do sit on the couch and watch TV and eat bonbons all day? You know, it's kind of 

Recording: (8056/ 10721) 
 Is it any worse than baseball cards? 

Recording: (8057/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8058/ 10721) 
 no asking each other opinions or anything like that. 

Recording: (8059/ 10721) 
 Right. Where they go to the clinic sometimes and the clinic's basically a pill pop in place, you know, here take these you'll feel better, you know, than they do  really don't get any satisfaction for what they owe them. You tell them you can't drink, but yet you give them a pill that'll give them the same effect.  you know, peace. 

Recording: (8060/ 10721) 
 crummy new apartment buildings, you know, sloppily constructed. Yes, yeah. 

Recording: (8061/ 10721) 
 It is and it was World War two that brought them together My my dad was in the  At the end of the war, he was in the Army Air Corps. He never had to go overseas, but he was stationed in Louisiana. 

Recording: (8062/ 10721) 
 They had to walk and I knew where they went and that was it. They didn't have the TV programs they have now. They had more programs.  that were actually like, I can't think of some of the names of them anymore. 

Recording: (8063/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well actually I do silk screening for t-shirts for my like for like on the side for myself like to generate income and then also as of  Monday, I'm working at Ohio. It's an environmental group. I'll be doing canvassing type stuff, just basically going door to door, sign this petition. 

Recording: (8064/ 10721) 
 It's a lot bigger. 

Recording: (8065/ 10721) 
 I don't think it ever really occurred to me. 

Recording: (8066/ 10721) 
 were like, oh, English people, your accent is so neat, and all that kind of thing. And then when I went there, and this was actually one of my friends, but I remember,  She was German and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things. And then she sort of looked at me and she said, like, oh, actually, I shouldn't be asking you. I don't want to learn the American way to say those. Like, I want to learn the  British way. People would say things all the time and they'd ask you what your background was and if you'd say, well, I'm American, they'd say, well, where you're 

Recording: (8067/ 10721) 
 right. 

Recording: (8068/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm Unless you know his dad was totally gone But he's been there ever since you know I was pregnant all through my pregnancy, and he's been there  for this whole two years, I wouldn't do that to him.

 Yeah, my grandfather's dead and my grandma's still alive now. She loves my son.

 Probably not. 

Recording: (8072/ 10721) 
 the hours with, because Jason works during the day too, so it would probably work out pretty well for us. 

Recording: (8073/ 10721) 
 I don't think it's the cartoons, because come on, if they're that stupid, you know what I mean? They shouldn't even be out on the street. I'm sorry. 

Recording: (8074/ 10721) 
 And eventually get my own business where I have a want that I want to get a spiritual bookstore.  and have things for everybody, you know, just come in and reading room, browse, you know, read this stuff, you know, take time off to relax because I think one of the  problems with stress and I think people are right in saying that we don't get enough exercise but 

Recording: (8075/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8076/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah. It's kind of like making your mouth water when you see food. 

Recording: (8077/ 10721) 
 papers or whatever. 

Recording: (8078/ 10721) 
 No, it was more black than white, to tell you the truth. Or it might have been even, but now it's more black than white, definitely now.  I live in a neighborhood where it's mostly black than white and that's where I've always lived my whole life. 

Recording: (8079/ 10721) 
 He's just sitting there, okay? That's not normal. And he comes home, you're talking to him? Yeah, it's not like you're here to talk to. 

Recording: (8080/ 10721) 
 Because I thought, you know, basically the city's been ran pretty well. Basically. You know, as far as cities are. 

Recording: (8081/ 10721) 
 uh... case western you're not from around here are you? 

Recording: (8082/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8083/ 10721) 
 When I worked at bars, I carried a gun constantly, and most of the cops in the neighborhood knew I carried a gun. 

Recording: (8084/ 10721) 
 mhm 

Recording: (8085/ 10721) 
 I think so, I think so. If you're willing, you know, anybody who's willing to put out the effort. I mean you do have to, you know, you have to sell yourself. There's, you know, you're not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered.  But if you put out the effort, I really don't think there's that kind of discrimination anymore. 

Recording: (8086/ 10721) 
 I don't know, do it incrementally. Like, you know, like, like, like, do like, like, hear a recitation and then kind of like work your way up. 

Recording: (8087/ 10721) 
 While they were here, there were many people that were bad eggs, man. 

Recording: (8088/ 10721) 
 right. Personally I think it's a good idea. I mean I I mean to me you  know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but  I come from a completely different background and everything else in education than most of the people that I know. 

Recording: (8089/ 10721) 
 or board games or just anything that happens to appeal. 

Recording: (8090/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it is. And it seems to me that they don't keep the very, very best of the kids in state, but it gets a lot of the, like, just below the absolute best in.  And it keeps a lot of them here. 

Recording: (8091/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8092/ 10721) 
 I don't know if they still do. That was a long time ago. That's always kind of been known for that, you know. 

Recording: (8093/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8094/ 10721) 
 My sister had gone a couple times and basically took me aside and I have but one sibling and it's  It's fun to have a sibling because nobody is more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with the inanity that is your family. 

Recording: (8095/ 10721) 
 have it meeting the missionaries. 

Recording: (8096/ 10721) 
 just walk in and start today or tell them, hey, the Mets strike's over, I'm gone. So that was kind of tough looking for that type of job.  Oh, yeah, three weeks of pay it's cost. Yeah, it costs quite a bit of money, but you got some Strike pay and this and that but it wasn't a lot, you know, $200  $200 a week isn't much at all. And when you have a family, I mean, $200 a week doesn't pay my daycare bill.

 take that away. 

Recording: (8098/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8099/ 10721) 
 as far as I was concerned for what they were doing. One principal from my daughter's high school,  He was out partying all the time. He was riding around in a Corvette and he tried to take me out. 

Recording: (8100/ 10721) 
 I think that's a cop out myself. 

Recording: (8101/ 10721) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (8102/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (8103/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8104/ 10721) 
 Okay, I might want to try to adjust this a little bit again. If you see it goes under, let me try putting it under here. I don't know if that would help.  That was probably gonna stay better. 

Recording: (8105/ 10721) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (8106/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (8107/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8108/ 10721) 
 Well, I've been in a lot more different cultures, seen a lot more different people live, found out how lucky I was. 

Recording: (8109/ 10721) 
 There not as many of them or you mean because. 

Recording: (8110/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8111/ 10721) 
 I think he specializes in like Solaris and HPUX. 

Recording: (8112/ 10721) 
 I'm sure Australia welcomes all those dollars, but they have a little wedding industry. 

Recording: (8113/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8114/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8115/ 10721) 
 Daryl. 

Recording: (8116/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8117/ 10721) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (8118/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8119/ 10721) 
 And they proceeded to set, I think they set two of our guns, the battery, I mean the tires on fire. 

Recording: (8120/ 10721) 
 You know, she goes, Dan. 

Recording: (8121/ 10721) 
 Just 

Recording: (8122/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (8123/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8124/ 10721) 
 That's why you always hear about the BB gun. 

Recording: (8125/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I don't... Well, that's fair. Maybe that's true too. I mean, I don't feel... Because you know when you're younger you think, oh my god, 27.  That's so old. You must be, you know, and now that you're here, you're like, I feel fine. I don't feel like... A little more responsible.  Other than that. 

Recording: (8126/ 10721) 
 In high school, yeah, I was friends with most of them. 

Recording: (8127/ 10721) 
 at the beginning he did perfectly but now he's doing this I want up at 4 o'clock kind of thing and give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep. I don't want  I don't want to walk all the way downstairs to make a bottle for a clock. I can't see, filling my way through the hallways and stuff. 

Recording: (8128/ 10721) 
 because it's hard for us to deal with. 

Recording: (8129/ 10721) 
 So, but that's, you know, I ended up settling the attorney, got most of the money. What little I had, I invested some and then I made some bad investments when I went  off my medication and blew it. So that was my responsibility, my fault.  that, you know, how it was just years of pent-up frustration and I just, I 

Recording: (8130/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8131/ 10721) 
 some of the work that needs to be done. 

Recording: (8132/ 10721) 
 So I think that's a problem too. Everybody says, well, I don't want to get there at 8.30. 

Recording: (8133/ 10721) 
 rate well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way it doesn't mean it's the right way and yeah I you know I really  really struggle with that because I come more from I think the family should teach it but let's be realistic how many families are going to do that or how  the mentality to do that. It seems like, so like my dad, it seems like these days most of the people, a lot of people that are having kids  you 

Recording: (8134/ 10721) 
 be really rude not helpful. 

Recording: (8135/ 10721) 
 Yeah, being a nurse, the wife, that helps a lot because that's what that thing was really functioning around was nurses, getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff.  So that's how it first started. Before, you wasn't even on campus. It was over on like 4th or Summit in a church when it first started.  It's just not, you know, people were always saying, I can't believe how much you pay for daycare. And I'm like, but look what we're getting, you know. People take their kids to. 

Recording: (8136/ 10721) 
 I've learned a lot. It's been interesting. I've liked my classes. 

Recording: (8137/ 10721) 
 Once you're in it, you've been in it, and that's it. I have 32 points. 

Recording: (8138/ 10721) 
 part it's a little bit much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me just all the sorts of changes and things like that.  going  I mean, there's no one watching every sandwich you have to do all the time and everything like that. 

Recording: (8139/ 10721) 
 just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother and they won't allow dogs so she's not allowed to go over there so she's always like  But it does make a big difference, so I guess that's what I'm saying for them. 

Recording: (8140/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8141/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8142/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8143/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8144/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well there wasn't even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it. There was nothing there. There was no ability to communicate. He needs to know this piece of information and at the same time there's no way I could tell it to him.  Yeah, you don't know and there's nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily. He said eventually, he said it was sometime later when I actually found out what was going on.  I had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count and figure out who's not there and assume something bad has happened. But he said, but it was a while before 

Recording: (8145/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8146/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (8147/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8148/ 10721) 
 For him to not make the honor roll every time, I couldn't even imagine what was happening with him. And now he's completely back on track and doing really well. And my eighth grade daughter is  She's, my kids are involved in all kinds of different things. She's real involved with theater. She's, everything that comes along, you know, she wins the science fair, she gets to  the power of the pen, she is on student count. They all have lots of different kinds of things that they're involved in and that I'm incredibly proud of them because they're just 

Recording: (8149/ 10721) 
 much in school with that. 

Recording: (8150/ 10721) 
 As to what the sanctuary should be like. So we had a tour. The choir took a tour, our choir director.  and arranged it to about five or six churches in the Columbus area to sing in them. Not for an audience, but just to sing.  see which ones we liked the acoustics of. And that was interesting. We sang in the Central Presbyterian Church  you 

Recording: (8151/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's a good growing area. The job prospects are a little scarce because of the smaller town.  Yeah, there's only about a 1% unemployment rate there. 

Recording: (8152/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8153/ 10721) 
 Most of the trouble I have, I got one neighbor that hates me and he's a sharer. 

Recording: (8154/ 10721) 
 Нормально. 

Recording: (8155/ 10721) 
 like they're living together, things like that. 

Recording: (8156/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8157/ 10721) 
 Oh, he's dead. 

Recording: (8158/ 10721) 
 That's right. Well, they don't they don't they don't give them I Don't know. Maybe they give each one one free ticket or something. You rest of them have to pay  Ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (8159/ 10721) 
 I often ask the teachers, I've gone to sporting events and there are teachers there, ticket takers, monitoring the crowd, wherever the kids, I ask them, I said, do you  you ever go home? No. Oh yeah. But they're always there. They're not there just teaching a class. They're not there preparing the class. They're there after the class.  They're there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family. That is a continuation of my philosophy. 

Recording: (8160/ 10721) 
 that makes sense and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather  rather than watch a 2-1 ballgame. 

Recording: (8161/ 10721) 
 Neither was I. I really wasn't. And it's funny I just this summer went to my 25th high school reunion. 

Recording: (8162/ 10721) 
 Hmm, how'd you end up in Ohio? 

Recording: (8163/ 10721) 
 Those are your... 

Recording: (8164/ 10721) 
 and dad didn't even come home the night before. But you know I mean there's all different kinds of situations. So I think it does start with the parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being  and shown and have access to. 

Recording: (8165/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8166/ 10721) 
 Plus with the internet and everything, they have access to so much information. I think that it falls back on the parents still.  If you're going to be a parent you need to be responsible, and I don't think that it's getting done 

Recording: (8167/ 10721) 
 She said, well, you have to take a foreign language. I said, look, I'm not taking any more foreign languages. We're going to figure out how to avoid this. No, you have to take a foreign. I said, look, lady, there are 60,000 students in this university.  And if you think that I'm going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the College of Foreign Language, you're insane. There's another way to do this experience. What is it?  You have to take a foreign language. I said, okay, we're going to change the question a little bit here. You have two options now. Tell me how to avoid taking a foreign language or tell me how to talk to somebody who isn't you because that's apparently all I 

Recording: (8168/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, you just send that right all over, but you don't want to tell how many people live in your house. 

Recording: (8169/ 10721) 
 Not in sort of an evil sense, necessarily, but just in sort of a challenging sense consistently. Yes, there was some sort of inherent communication breakdown. My mother's kind of a flake.  Not that I'm not a flake, but we're flaking in different ways.

 that ru-

 in your address, you didn't even have to write it, you just had to know how to say it in your phone number, and recognize the color words.  and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills. And that was about all they expect you to do.  you to play cooperatively. That's about all they expect you to know. Now in kindergarten, they expect you to know all

 So I was the second generation of his, because he was like 57 years old when I was born. So probably the last thing he really wanted was another kid. 

Recording: (8174/ 10721) 
 There's a tradition. You see, now you're looking for reasons. That's looking for science. 

Recording: (8175/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8176/ 10721) 
 I mean, it's a lot better than it was even a year ago. 

Recording: (8177/ 10721) 
 So that was like through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that. 

Recording: (8178/ 10721) 
 So I think

 you

 But it's just me, you know. I told her, I tried to tell her, you know. I'm not in any kind of writing special program or anything like that.  I'm not a doctor, that's for damn sure. Driving an 85 truck. 

Recording: (8181/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and the smaller house, like bigger squished in areas, are the older area. 

Recording: (8182/ 10721) 
 It's just like a miniature version of Ohio State. 

Recording: (8183/ 10721) 
 Oh! 

Recording: (8184/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8185/ 10721) 
 I mean I think they could try. If their kids try to push them away, they shouldn't let their kids push them away. I guess you  can't make your kid go out with you and do things. 

Recording: (8186/ 10721) 
 Yeah, exactly. It's a very conservative town. 

Recording: (8187/ 10721) 
 I  forklift back there and you're not going to just dodge that. 

Recording: (8188/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8189/ 10721) 
 It's like, I guess I can apply for welfare in that. 

Recording: (8190/ 10721) 
 And I did a lot of music interviewing and writing there. And then I moved up to editor. And it was sort of through that job that I got my first job with Sony while I was  as a sort of Ohio representative. So I was concentrated in Ohio State. And then, you know, basically, it's just something I'm not doing this as a career.  It's just sort of something I'm doing in the meantime until I decide whether I'm going back to school or not. 

Recording: (8191/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8192/ 10721) 
 No.

Recording: (8195/ 10721) 
 One of the hardest. 

Recording: (8196/ 10721) 
 Really, and it's a fun job, it really is. I've only ever known one male that taught first grade. And I knew one guy that taught third.  Most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like 4, 5, or 6. But I really think that if we let the boys  always be more exposed to men earlier, then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it's not just a girly thing. 

Recording: (8197/ 10721) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (8198/ 10721) 
 I don't want to do anything until past January. Since 1974, I've never had Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year's off without having  to work either a 7-3 or a 3-11, you know, and it's like I figure I deserve this. It's about time I get to not eat Thanksgiving  dinner at 1030 in the morning so I can go to work at noon or something, or open the Christmas presents at 5 o'clock in the afternoon because I

I want to smack him and he's being a little Barney. But I choose to be in love with him because I made that choice and then that passes and lo and behold an hour later  or week later, whatever it takes, I'm in love with him again. I mean, really, you know what I'm saying? And I think it's just too 

Recording: (8203/ 10721) 
 to make money on the side all through the government. That's what I mean. It's too easy to get away with stuff nowadays. 

Recording: (8204/ 10721) 
 There are some good athletes, especially on the west coast like Stanford. I have a friend who is from California.

 There seems to be an awful lot of publicizing of some of it. I mean, it's pretty dramatic. A woman setting fire to somebody. What happened in Columbine? It's very dramatic.  When it happened in Columbine, that was all that was on the news for a whole day. It seemed like anywhere you looked, that's where it was. This thing was coming loose a little.  there.

Why something that I talked to mom about I wouldn't talk to you about that's cool But you know, that's why I'd like you know that I do know women go through that stuff, you know  So...

 Right. Exactly. Yeah.  It is and it's not it's my house isn't as clean as I'd like it to be but Yeah, but that's just one month  minor, minor thing. And I feel like I'm just in a kind of a phase, if you will. It's

 Personally, no, I don't think so. 

Recording: (8228/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Well, I think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more. I mean, it's smaller compared to most downtowns. I mean, you know, it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and  you're out. So I don't think that would hurt anything. And then to live there if they made it more affordable, that would be nice.

My daughter, who goes to Ohio State, chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her.  It's not that these girls aren't independent and can't do it on their own. My second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was 12. I mean, she's just very, very  and we'll see you next time.

Recording: (8280/ 10721) 
 I said, you know, I don't know why you are insecure. I said, everything you do, you do well.

 Boy, I don't know, I'm thinking, you know, of the divorced people I know who've had children involved.  Boy, it always seems to me by the time they get to that step, it's already, you know, they've already been to counseling, they've already tried a lot of other things, and that there  I don't know whether some kind of court-ordered thinking about it

 No, he didn't either. He joined when he was 16 and he was Catholic before. Similar, just kind of thing with him. 

Recording: (8348/ 10721) 
 I told him that he gets no guarantee that I will come back and in exchange I don't get health coverage while I'm gone. That seems perfectly reasonable to me and I go, okay, super.

 But with people coming back later and saying that they changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents, I'd be concerned about that.  That's not going to happen in this case, I don't think. And because of her age, and this makes no sense to me, the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for 72 hours.  before she could give it up for adoption. Because of her age, it doesn't make any sense to me. So they're talking to a social worker now. 

Recording: (8355/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8356/ 10721) 
 In most school districts it's comparable to any other job now. It used to always be low, but like a beginning teacher in  Worthington starts at I think twenty-six, eight or something. Of course Worthington is one of the three highest paid districts in Ohio.  It used to be that teachers just got paid lower than starting firemen or starting policemen.

My counselor just kind of found it and he had posted it and he especially tried to notify  by the National Merit people about it, and I was the only one who really caught it, even though the other ones, like half of them wanted to go to medical school. They all, one of them's at Princeton right now.

And, you know, what more could she want, you know, was basically what she was  saying I've got my own place, I can do whatever I want, I'm getting money and I don't have to work. And so that I think is a very bad situation because they're almost rewarded.

 That's alright. 

Recording: (8501/ 10721) 
 You mentioned earlier about how this would affect the children with this two-year welfare thing. I mean, at least I know a lot more about the system there for whatever reason.  I mean, I don't really think in a lot of situations, of course, I'm sure there are  people who follow it as it should be and who really need it and who are really taking care of their children. But unfortunately you don't really see that side very much. You see the people who like 

Recording: (8502/ 10721) 
 I think it does. I like to exercise. I think it's fun. I would just do it four hours a day if I could do that. Although I haven't for the last six weeks, I haven't  anything because it's just I've had these other things that are that are really pressing. You know how that is. You get you have some things you just have to get done and then when I get this stuff cleared out there'll be a break and then I'll be able to get back  back to it. 

Recording: (8503/ 10721)

 Please. 

Recording: (8511/ 10721) 
 I think I didn't know the difference so it didn't affect me at all. They're just another person. I think more as I'm being exposed to patients with a different  different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need. I felt somewhat ill-equipped the first few times.  but knowing what the expectations are, especially with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into sexuality and teaching them after injury. 

Recording: (8512/ 10721) 
 and you screwed something up.

 because i tell her things like i said you know what you really need to do is like in the morning when you're all done dressing you look at the mirror and go i look pretty good today or when you've done something like say uh... she's  in a play right now, and when you come home at night, you need to look in the mirror and go, I did pretty good at the play today. Other people did well, but I think I did the best I've done so far.  And it's not to make yourself an egomaniac. It's just a, you know, that's like those little subtle hints. 

Recording: (8519/ 10721) 
 well, you watch the movie, and you're like, 

Recording: (8520/ 10721) 
 which is a government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work. And because I already  have a bachelor's, they won't pay for school. Now if I were stupid, you know, if I just had a basic, just got out of grade school.  I didn't even have my GED. Boy, they'd pay for my high school, my college, and everything. Even living expenses. 

Recording: (8521/ 10721) 
 What's really weird is I go to my mom's neighborhood and you'll still see kids playing out there in the schoolyard playing baseball. Now I got a schoolyard right next to me, you come up there and you see no kids doing it.

Recording: (8528/ 10721) 
 but she's out there somewhere. Again, we don't have clear evidence where she is. There were a couple of times where  Where we thought we knew where Samantha was, when there were all those clones of her, I think that was in the second season or so.  I think if they were going to end it, they were going to have to have three episodes in a row that were tying up all these 

Recording: (8529/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8530/ 10721) 
 And that was very stressful. 

Recording: (8531/ 10721) 
 It burned his, he got his hands up in front of his face so it didn't burn his face, but it burned his legs and his stomach. 

Recording: (8532/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (8533/ 10721) 
 I mean the way I grew up it was probably like back in the day, like Catholics against the Columbus publics, you know?  the richies against the poories. That's how I kind of see it. But when I went to Northland, people think Northland's like a rich school. But the way I see it is  No, not really. I mean we do live in a big house area. The houses are like huge. But  you 

Recording: (8534/ 10721) 
 I'm sure it probably will. 

Recording: (8535/ 10721) 
 Basically, you know, we used to be able to go to the woods and everything else now You don't even see merry-go-rounds on the playground because people would sue over it. Yeah, no offense people are ridiculous  us.

 Okay, so it's just like an independent contractor for them. 

Recording: (8540/ 10721) 
 I'll just keep them as friends. That works. 

Recording: (8541/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, like... 

Recording: (8542/ 10721) 
 Yeah, oh my, uh, I'm in this, uh, venturing crew, which is through Boy Scouts. Our leader has this, like, society totally planned out. 

Recording: (8543/ 10721) 
 Aerospace industry. My dad had a degree in engineering.  What kind of engineering? Drafting engineering, I think, and worked for...  in California and they asked him to move to the North American plant here in Columbus out near the airport.

 Tennessee, they're even friendlier in some places. 

Recording: (8545/ 10721) 
 And so I give her most credit for. 

Recording: (8546/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8547/ 10721) 
 We want to serve you. They didn't get that at all. They were like, ooh. Some people would just be like, no, no way. That doesn't make sense. 

Recording: (8548/ 10721) 
 people I guess change over the years. Their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and I think it is to me it's getting worse but in my  mother used to say the same thing about our generation. So I think it's just a sign of the times. I don't know what it is. 

Recording: (8549/ 10721) 
 But other ones, you have to take the full major. Some people are doing, gosh, I think one's doing business and one's doing economics. 

Recording: (8550/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8551/ 10721) 
 No, that's one thing that I found was really lacking here for my son. 

Recording: (8552/ 10721) 
 I think it's been good. I mean, the economy has been very good. It seems like society seems to be improving.  moving, you know, even though we talked about this. 

Recording: (8553/ 10721) 
 Yeah, Jason and I went together. 

Recording: (8554/ 10721)

 needs for that budget. They bought things on a cash basis as they needed it. They did not go out and spend on credit.  Business said, hey, let's produce these lines. Little lady, you want a refrigerator? We can make it for you. And we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it. 

Recording: (8560/ 10721) 
 saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because I had so much potential and they weren't going to let me throw my life away like this. It was bizarre.  So I was always from that time on I decided these people are all crazy. I'm never going to be like that. And so I have a whole lot of different values.  from my family and it's real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (8561/ 10721) 
 drove me nuts. Say a few words for posterity, he'd say. And we'd say, get out of here. 

Recording: (8562/ 10721) 
 I get a job at Hyde Park. It's just amazing because the money is so good. You really can't beat it. I only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever.  I did that all through high school and college.  I graduated from high school. I managed a restaurant for about a year and a half. 

Recording: (8563/ 10721) 
 You know? 

Recording: (8564/ 10721) 
 Right. It's bad. It's bad. On the other hand, it's not good to let your mind wander off somewhere. I find myself having to focus sometimes.  I mean, to really... 

Recording: (8565/ 10721) 
 Yeah, probably have to go to Dublin or Worthington, somewhere around there to find a couple millionaires.  But... 

Recording: (8566/ 10721)

 Yeah, exactly. 

Recording: (8568/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (8569/ 10721) 
 it's like a mail order catalog thing and uh... so uh... people are really really incompetent it's really funny like for some people  I don't know how they even some people who can't speak English even well enough I don't know how they got signed up or how they even have a credit card to order I mean until  you can tell especially when people call from all over it's really funny to talk to people from Alabama or South Carolina. I never knew people from South Carolina had such thick accents. I never really thought of 

Recording: (8570/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I like baseball. I used to like that a lot better when I was younger. But no, I wouldn't take the time to sit and watch a whole baseball game on TV. 

Recording: (8571/ 10721) 
 No.

 and

 bars and every once in a while there'll be a fight and it's still, I mean, it still is disturbing to me. I have a distinct difference  in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like aren't making that distinction but I don't think so  And I think if someone isn't making that distinction, it's... I don't know. 

Recording: (8575/ 10721) 
 get into school and they get violent and they take it out and everybody is surprised. I'm not because I know there's a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids.  And going to school is going to be so dangerous, I think, because you have so many of them in one little room and they're coming from so many different backgrounds.  and if you take each one of their situations, I can bet the statistics as time goes on, 

Recording: (8576/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8577/ 10721) 
 So we've really never had a lot of use for the Union but recently we just figured out that you know If they decide to strike we have no choice too, and you can't work  because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you cannot work. Anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made. They'll take them to court and they'll get  Yeah, it's against the union contract. You had to say it. 

Recording: (8578/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I think they're two-faced. 

Recording: (8579/ 10721) 
 I mean he would have been in the money then, because he was just starting his business down there. And while I was down there, he had  me sleeping in a truck, a moving truck, and uh, oh man, it's a hilarious story. I mean, 30 foot moving truck, I'm sleeping in it.  And I get 

Recording: (8580/ 10721) 
 Well, one would hope that there would be enough education on the subject that the kids wouldn't think it was that odd. 

Recording: (8581/ 10721) 
 Yeah, like, it's killing its own citizens. It's so ridiculous. 

Recording: (8582/ 10721) 
 I agree with everything he has said, but I'm a little more, I don't know what the right word is to say here, but sometimes I think politics are  They're a little bit dirty. 

Recording: (8583/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8584/ 10721) 
 group of five guys who know each other. 

Recording: (8585/ 10721) 
 but I love it. 

Recording: (8586/ 10721) 
 snobs. I'm from Palo Alto, don't talk to me. You know, you're not, you're not, you're not worthy. 

Recording: (8587/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (8588/ 10721) 
 Yeah, if I had stayed for the fourth year, when we would do a lot of  of making up a portfolio, that kind of thing. I probably then I would have started going to interviews and I probably would have stayed.  But it was 

Recording: (8589/ 10721) 
 Same. 

Recording: (8590/ 10721) 
 Um, I, first of all, couldn't be referred. 

Recording: (8591/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8592/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (8593/ 10721) 
 Exactly. But I do, there's the other side with Native Americans too. It's, you know, our children are being taken away from us. Well, not exactly.  giving up your children and something has to be done. But there's also that. I mean, I think it is probably  legitimate fear that children of that group are going to be homogenized out of their heritage. 

Recording: (8594/ 10721) 
 And it never goes back to the way it was before. You just know that there's someone that's completely dependent on you for everything. 

Recording: (8595/ 10721) 
 I was like a rebel, you know, I didn't really, it wasn't really my cup of tea. Actually, I had a pretty decent job. I worked four and a half days a week.  Basically in the electro mechanical type of things, you know, remove and replace what they do a lot now with cars They put a thing on a machine and says take that out  out you know try it you know you put that in so in hindsight you know it was cool but I had I like to 

Recording: (8596/ 10721) 
 four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Just to get a volume level. 

Recording: (8597/ 10721) 
 And then you come here, you know what I mean? You see people stand out on street corners with signs, work for food. 

Recording: (8598/ 10721) 
 I mean, there are gays in Congress, there are gays in the military. As long as people don't know, they don't feel threatened. I don't understand that mindset.  I really don't. I don't know why a man feels threatened by having a gay near them. I have a couple of gay friends and one of my friends always says,  Does every man like every woman he sees? Is he attracted to every woman? Does he want to go to bed with every woman? What makes a man think that just because 

Recording: (8599/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8600/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you just find it. I can do anything I want. Yeah. 

Recording: (8601/ 10721) 
 And I'm going to hold you to this confidentiality because very few people know about this. 

Recording: (8602/ 10721) 
 of at the same time every day. 

Recording: (8603/ 10721) 
 It is, it was very much high school. 

Recording: (8604/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, Archbishop Romero, yeah, in El Salvador. That's right.  That's right. That's right. Yes. So there are conservative and progressive wings.  every religion I'm sure. Even probably Unitarian Universalist, although I've heard 

Recording: (8605/ 10721) 
 i've been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up with like heroin and things like that 

Recording: (8606/ 10721) 
 Basically, last time I heard he was doing lawn care. He's done about everything like I told him, you know. Get as many jobs as you can until you figure out what you want to do.  He's done maintenance work, he's done sales work, he's doing lawn care now, he's done gardening.  Uh, his girlfriend, they live together. He's not married. Like I said, he's got a kid. They've been together for about four years. But, uh, 

Recording: (8607/ 10721) 
 No, that's interesting though, because I think that my whole, I mean, I always still, I still feel like I'm just. 

Recording: (8608/ 10721) 
 for domestic violence. That's an organization that I think would be really interesting and help me feel like, you know, helping people. They give,  new direction for abused wives and mothers and help them get on their feet, you know, give them the access to the different organizations that are out there.  basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they're abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that 

Recording: (8609/ 10721) 
 or a town. 

Recording: (8610/ 10721) 
 I can't believe it. That just blows my mind. You can spend all thousands of dollars just for a wedding. 

Recording: (8611/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8612/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8613/ 10721) 
 I think it's the combination plus I think the dressing is my sister's recipe for dressing.  balsamic vinegar dressing with olive oil and garlic. It's just a real good dressing. I tend to use that most times. And everything being chilled.  just nicely chilled and all that sort of thing. 

Recording: (8614/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8615/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean, you know, signing. Oh, here you go, hon. The one, I think, is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that shouldn't have happened.  And the other one, yeah, you just, let's face it, at that age and at every age, we want a leader.  and I guess it goes back if we choose to or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we'll make better decisions of who's going to lead us. 

Recording: (8616/ 10721) 
 a lot more places to live. It seems like everywhere I turn there's construction and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couple years if you don't go in that area  and it's all changed, it looks all different. So and that's mainly like looking up Bethel and 315 or things like that. 

Recording: (8617/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8618/ 10721) 
 And that's essentially what the Supreme Court said in their last decision on this two, three years ago. What they said was whether we think it's right or wrong, whether we think the previous Supreme Court was right or wrong, it's been a  part of this fabric of this country for more than 10 years and to reverse it would create too much, too many problems for people.  which I thought was a nice way of saying, sorry folks, but it's too late. 

Recording: (8619/ 10721) 
 Okay, so um, Chris and I spent the rest of the evening calling people. I got it in my head that I didn't want anybody to  call and say, how's your dad doing? And so the best way to deal with that situation was to call globally, across the board. Plus it was a fun psychological experiment. Just as they go,  because how often do you get to tell people that the dude that just killed himself this morning? So I'm like, hi, how you doing? No, I haven't talked to you. 

Recording: (8620/ 10721) 
 I was like, wow, I couldn't believe it. 

Recording: (8621/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8622/ 10721) 
 Stay on it. 

Recording: (8623/ 10721) 
 right and then they wonder why you know I don't know what's happened it's the other person who's changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you  can usually get the kinds of changes. I always figure if you treat people the way that old golden rule thing, if you give out what you want back, you get it. 

Recording: (8624/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, and to a certain extent, everybody gets the same upbringing through mass media and.  and well, malls. 

Recording: (8625/ 10721) 
 Oh I see. Well that'd be a good way I would think. 

Recording: (8626/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8627/ 10721) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (8628/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8629/ 10721) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (8630/ 10721) 
 Which one are you talking about? 

Recording: (8631/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (8632/ 10721) 
 It's not that I wouldn't keep talking, but you probably sort of have a limited... Yeah. 

Recording: (8633/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8634/ 10721) 
 We kept together in a zoo actually. 

Recording: (8635/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8636/ 10721) 
 It's so dirty, I wish they'd clean it up more. When I first started working for the courier service.  I really really hated one-way streets and once you get the hang of it, they're a blessing because you're in downtown and all of a sudden ding ding ding ding ding ding you see like 12  green lights in a row. You're just like, you go as fast as you can and try and get through all of them all at the same time. Now mind you, if you're doing that any time during the day, that won't happen because you've got cars all around. 

Recording: (8637/ 10721) 
 they were. 

Recording: (8638/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm 

Recording: (8639/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, I was ready. Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8640/ 10721) 
 one of my kids got it for me. 

Recording: (8641/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8642/ 10721) 
 You know, so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do. 

Recording: (8643/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8644/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8645/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8646/ 10721) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (8647/ 10721) 
 Most of them at our site, now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect others. People connect us and then go out. It's a gateway to other places.  We're getting more into that now. But that wasn't so easy before either, the web again. 

Recording: (8648/ 10721) 
 She's our guy, right? 

Recording: (8649/ 10721) 
 So basically there's no way, you know, unless you have a steel cabinet to put that gun in. And there we go. The rich can afford that, but the poor can't. 

Recording: (8650/ 10721) 
 They have to pay, I'm like, what? 

Recording: (8651/ 10721) 
 I'm really anything like right now I'm just painting and they laugh at me because I went the other day and found some chairs that were that badly and ask if I could  have them cleaned them up and I'm painting those and things like that. 

Recording: (8652/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you just set the computer and key the data in. Or, well, the system we're doing now is you can put in the address, the URL for a web resource, and it goes out and extracts data, analyzes it, and then it's sent to the server.  what's there and comes up with subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it.  doing some of that. Some of that is the automatic assigning of subject headings and call numbers. We're doing a lot of research on that. It's got 

Recording: (8653/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8654/ 10721) 
 You know, like work hard when you have to. 

Recording: (8655/ 10721) 
 the seaporters, and they were not very desirable specimens other than for heating.  Sheep. And we come in dirty. Dirty as an old sheep herder.  Heh. 

Recording: (8656/ 10721) 
 I wasn't really living. I was actually serving a mission for my church. 

Recording: (8657/ 10721) 
 So now I am independent without family in Columbus. 

Recording: (8658/ 10721) 
 You're a woman, you're a minority. 

Recording: (8659/ 10721) 
 Wait, even though it's an inanimate object, it all kinda came together. 

Recording: (8660/ 10721) 
 They did. They didn't come every day, but they came occasionally and it helped. And we mopped our own floor, like on the hall a few times. We just basically need the bathrooms done. 

Recording: (8661/ 10721) 
 are, you know, the things that we learned when we were kids because our mom taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something. They all look at you like, Christopher  Robin, who's that? Piglet, who's that? You know, there's a whole generation of kids now  whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale stuff and nursery rhyme stuff, they don't have a clue what you're talking about. 

Recording: (8662/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8663/ 10721) 
 Yeah, like you share your spoon, you know, or you share, you know, you get, you know, like an extra blanket. I would think, you know, hey, you know, you need something, you need this or that. 

Recording: (8664/ 10721) 
 It's a traffic jam and I'm not moving as I'm 

Recording: (8665/ 10721) 
 Oh, right. 

Recording: (8666/ 10721) 
 language requirement. I'm like, well, I already know all this French, I might as well take some more French. And a first year freshman year of French. Yeah, it was not fun. My second year sophomore, I started in for another  year of French. About three quarters of the way through the year I realized that every day was all about dreading French class before and after. I would spend all after French class going, no, no French class! And all after French class going,  I was like, this is stupid. There's no way to live my life. So I went to my counselor. I said no French class. That's how it's going to be. So you need to figure out how I'm not going to end up taking French. Well, you have to take it. 

Recording: (8667/ 10721) 
 So she drove me all the way out of that county to the next county where the pancake place is.  She went out of her way and out of her jurisdiction with this Southern hospitality just to get me out of the weather.

 fireplace, full dry basement, you know, two and a half car garage, you know, all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses, wet basements, garage burned down or anything.  You know, the lots were packed. We live on a golf course and have a creek in the backyard. So it's really, yeah, they play in the creek, they don't play  Golf, yeah. 

Recording: (8669/ 10721) 
 hopefully. 

Recording: (8670/ 10721) 
 have the money to throw away in like Catholic schools. They don't have the money to put on those programs. So some of those people kind of get pushed aside. And so, you know, as you can see, I'm staying in my soapbox here. I do like  Columbus Public Schools, but you know, I hate when people say, you know, look at these test scores because it really doesn't reflect what's there because it's like saying all kids carry guns to school.  They don't. The media says, well, what has there been? Like maybe five or six people who have taken guns to school and killed people. Well, what about the millions and millions of people who have been killed? 

Recording: (8671/ 10721) 
 issues. So, you know, that's one thing that I hope that they work on. 

Recording: (8672/ 10721) 
 Okay, so how you gonna help them when they're all over? 

Recording: (8673/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8674/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8675/ 10721) 
 Maybe I should go back and get a degree in electrical engineering, that would be a lot of fun. 

Recording: (8676/ 10721) 
 Northern Mall hosts the Battle of the Bands once a month. 

Recording: (8677/ 10721) 
 And that's what a lot of people are telling me. You know, just, you know, life's a struggle. 

Recording: (8678/ 10721) 
 just like a regular job like a 40-hour week or wee weeks okay okay  So you think it's just like one-on-one where you just like sit like like like us doing or wait a second in a classroom setting you just have like a group conversation?  Okay. Okay.  to the 

Recording: (8679/ 10721) 
 So that it, you know, I have a hard time picturing an 83-year-old woman as Tammy. 

Recording: (8680/ 10721) 
 That'd be great. I would do it, definitely. 

Recording: (8681/ 10721) 
 I live at 161 in Cleveland area, an apartment up there. 

Recording: (8682/ 10721) 
 So the math server has tons of extra room on it. So he just kind of snuck in our account. It is legal, but I'm not sure how related to the university it is.  you 

Recording: (8683/ 10721) 
 It's American from the fact that it was written by Native Americans.  And Joseph Smith was an American and he was used to translate it. It's actually funny though.  There's more members of the church that live outside of America. 

Recording: (8684/ 10721) 
 on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person was over here that's Jane Doe that lives in that third house and she married Henry Jackson  Don't you remember old Henry? Well, Henry was a guy who lived way over there on the other side of town. Mass communications as it is today.  haven't the faintest idea where Jane came from or where Henry Jackson or where old whoever he was lived over there I said. So 

Recording: (8685/ 10721) 
 But just something happened. Boy, he got him and his girlfriend broke up. 

Recording: (8686/ 10721) 
 Haha. 

Recording: (8687/ 10721) 
 I want the discipline and I want the religion basis. 

Recording: (8688/ 10721) 
 passing in health class maybe and then it should be known that you can go to your counselor. 

Recording: (8689/ 10721) 
 when Northland moves and all that, that the existing building, she thinks they should turn into a discount store. 

Recording: (8690/ 10721) 
 like ever, but I don't know, it's real weird. 

Recording: (8691/ 10721) 
 I don't know where the children ever picked up, but I am sure that they weren't born that way because there's been a lot of them who have been married, had kids, and I know one.  Then when he got the divorce, I don't know why he changed his mind started living with the with the guys 

Recording: (8692/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8693/ 10721) 
 He's a disappointment. 

Recording: (8694/ 10721) 
 Whereas, you know. 

Recording: (8695/ 10721) 
 I read and 

Recording: (8696/ 10721) 
 and actually know where he's going. 

Recording: (8697/ 10721) 
 And there's lighting effects like strobe lights, disco balls. 

Recording: (8698/ 10721) 
 because that is sort of what I found interesting there too. I mean there were a lot of jibes about that. I remember driving to Germany with a couple English friends and to visit some German  friends of theirs and we got there and we got lost in all these things. It took us way longer than it should have and a friend of the person we were visiting said like, oh what did you have to  stop at every McDonald's along the way. And I was like, I'm a vegetarian. I don't even eat at McDonald's, you know. And I was just, you know, and it was really mean. 

Recording: (8699/ 10721) 
 or art. 

Recording: (8700/ 10721) 
 I hope not. Some of these mongers that goes around and always predicts the worst things like everybody's saying at the end of, you know, when 2000 happens, don't go out and celebrate New Year's Eve. The world's got a hand.  you go to the end. 

Recording: (8701/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (8702/ 10721) 
 Oh wow. So you have it on the speed dial. 

Recording: (8703/ 10721) 
 Is that where you got married? 

Recording: (8704/ 10721) 
 I think I could summarize just with a few words of what you're meaning to say. Maybe wrong. But I think you're really meaning to say  we must get back to the family. There must be two parents and they must recognize their children and do  like you have just discussed, do with them. And because today we're just drifting and drifting and drifting. 

Recording: (8705/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8706/ 10721) 
 I went there one day and ate my lunch all the time for two weeks and they paid me $10 for that. 

Recording: (8707/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8708/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and yeah, so I. 

Recording: (8709/ 10721) 
 Now what, that's industrial nucleonics or something like that. Well, think about it. Now you got the wetlands down there. Where are kids going to go? 

Recording: (8710/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8711/ 10721) 
 Yeah, she might know her name. She's on the school board now. 

Recording: (8712/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8713/ 10721) 
 I guess it's just over the course of the year, everything balances out, you know. 

Recording: (8714/ 10721) 
不還好 

Recording: (8715/ 10721) 
 no sunlight, you know, and they don't give him, they keep it warm and he's not allowed sheets or razors or, you know, other than electric razors so he can't kill himself. So you're  stuck. There's nothing you could do all day for 40 years or however until he naturally dies. And that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse.  Like, just the agony and the... I think you'd have to go insane. There's really so much you... I'd ask for board games or something, but like, he doesn't even hear a human voice. 

Recording: (8716/ 10721) 
 I'm like, ah, for some reason I'm supposed to do this. I can't explain it, but you're always looking for reasons you're asking me. I'm looking for reasons, but a lot of times  You can't give a reason. It just happens. Why did you marry your husband? How did you meet your husband? How did he come about? How did the passing go to? Explain that to your offspring someday. 

Recording: (8717/ 10721) 
 uncomfortable. 

Recording: (8718/ 10721) 
 Well, I was in management for about 13, 14 years, and it wasn't bad where I was before. This management was, it was the whole department.  I don't know what it was, people, they were always arguing and fighting, it was just the whole atmosphere of that place and it was just...  People that I'd known for years and gotten along well with were just, they were different when they went in there. They just changed. It was just, it was just not a good place to work. 

Recording: (8719/ 10721) 
 West side off the road. 

Recording: (8720/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (8721/ 10721)

I think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you're looking at people driving both ways. And I think if people are actually going to make it so people are  going to use it, I think it would probably be a pretty good thing to have. And I voted for it. I can't believe you're going to do that.

 I think that there should be a mandatory, because you have it in big companies, you have mandatory sexual harassment tapes.  And you learn, you teach the girls that it's not what they do, it's how they make you feel is constituted as your harassment there.  and they're too afraid. And then besides that, there's crushes. You can't fault the girls for having crushes and things like that. They're going through enough things as it is. 

Recording: (8749/ 10721)

And there's that life, women have that gift of life that they can give. Men can't do that.  There's just a lot there that women go through that purification every month.

But I know that there was at one point, you know, some sort 

Recording: (8765/ 10721) 
 It's more feasible than a six-year-old.

And this may seem to be contradictory.  And

Recording: (8817/ 10721) 
 I shouldn't be having to clean quite as much as I do now. I'd say by 10, they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do my  most of it by themselves. I know I did it and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help  a lot around the house.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8822/ 10721) 
 And not that that changed my opinion of her, but back then, and nobody would talk about it. And I just think in today's world.  we need to bring subjects like that out. Because there are so many people who are ashamed about things and they shouldn't be ashamed because it's a lifestyle anymore.  It needs to be brought up more. 

Recording: (8823/ 10721) 
 terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain I think is a most thing that ever was passed I don't think  should be any plea bargains. And then there are people who get murdered and sent to the electric chair. Electric chair? I still believe in it. Because if someone is  And I don't believe that they should have 10 years of what do they call that legal process where they can bring appeals. Thank you. That's it.

 So any other impressions of Columbus?  Well, number one, I didn't realize that it was as big as it is until I started working for the courier service. You know, I've heard people say, and I know it's true, that Columbus  is one of the top 10 largest cities in the United States. And I was like, you're kidding me. Really? I started driving around and I'm like, yeah, it is. This place is huge.

 I've been back there for about 10 10 years. I'd like to move back down there, but there just isn't any work, you know, it's unless you own your own company, so that basically  basically as remodeling drywall, stuff like that.

 Hahaha 

Recording: (8894/ 10721) 
 Of course, my wife's worked in higher education for 30 years, so. 

Recording: (8895/ 10721) 
 I was a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status, several different campaigns in Ohio and in Dayton where I came from, but moved to Columbus  to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union. I did that for a couple of years until I went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts.  I did that, that's kind of stressful, so I decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that.

 And they see the same thing smeared back to them because we're making Christ's images. And we can't say no to him.  That's what heaven's like. That's what we should go to bed at night thinking, what did we do positive today and build on the positive. It may have been the smallest part of that.  paper. 

Recording: (8897/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, and that's normal, we understood that. We knew a lot of stuff. We raised him to be very independent. And I always said that we're gonna regret this someday.  I said another ten years we'll be pleased, but we were not particularly raised either of us, my wife or I, to be very independent.  I guess the point that when we were first married, it was hard to make a simple decision on anything. We've worked through that after 25 years.  . 

Recording: (8898/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (8899/ 10721) 
 kept promoting. And then all of a sudden, about the 90s, they came around and said, hey, you know what? Our deficit's going the other way. We're going way out of whack on this thing. That's because we've been spending more.  Consumers are doing the same thing. They haven't learned that mom and dad remember mom went out and got little pieces of time as they needed things. No, I'm with the whole house completely  for 

Recording: (8900/ 10721) 
 It's very informal here, so I don't know what we were doing, but. 

Recording: (8901/ 10721) 
 And I'm not quite sure how to address that. Because some people would say, now wait a minute, you're talking out of both sides of your mouth, the expression is. How can you say,  over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and then over here you're saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution. 

Recording: (8902/ 10721) 
 And then I have a daughter in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I have a daughter in Reston, Virginia. So they did, they're all married. Well, three are married, yeah. 

Recording: (8903/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (8904/ 10721) 
 and it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job anyhow. Just kind of one of those, okay, let's do it. 

Recording: (8905/ 10721) 
 Well, I was with Mormons, so I don't know if you've ever seen how they go two by two always. I was with what we call  another sister. And we would live in an apartment and we would pay for our own mission. And there was a mission president and they had different people.  with responsibilities, leaders, and they would watch over you and make sure, you know, call every night and check on you. But it was really 

Recording: (8906/ 10721) 
 and then Ohio, and then back down to Tennessee, and then back to Ohio. 

Recording: (8907/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8908/ 10721) 
 that we've talked about before but couldn't really do very well. So it's pretty neat. 

Recording: (8909/ 10721) 
 and stuff but that doesn't get to express my creative side as much so it would be my favorite job was one where I did the accounting but I dealt with people as well  and like would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too. So right. 

Recording: (8910/ 10721) 
 Well, because my cousins and they all have a, they're very, you know, well-educated.  educated and they're more affluent. And I think that maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there.

 Both times I stayed around this little town. It's like northwest of Munich. So it was southern. Most Brooklyn

 Well, you know, in my girls, there are certain products that brand name, like one of them I know is the Meyer pudding that you can take for lunches, which they do. And it's  like Ed Venture.

 to GI's. 

Recording: (8923/ 10721) 
 Because they got beaches and yeah. I don't think Lake Erie can compare. That would hurt. 

Recording: (8924/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8925/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, I would say so.

 I'm just an operator right now. I've done production work too for them.

 businessmen. My dad and I have been screwing around with stocks for years. I've been in contact with a day trading firm down in West Virginia and they're starting an intern program sometime, I don't even know  win, but if that opens up, I will probably seriously consider going down to West Virginia.  I've been saying West Virginia, haven't I? They're in Virginia, sorry. Their home base is in Richmond, Virginia. 

Recording: (8931/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, but many people, especially the kid that young, may not know what that really means.  and may as to be part of the group and part of the you know be cool may go along with it when really they don't like it I don't I haven't made up my mind about him whether he's telling the truth or whether he hasn't or whether he  wasn't.

 The day I left the hospital, he was running around with him.

 the big boys get all the breaks. So in my opinion, the judge didn't want to hear the case before then, or maybe his docket was full, but I'm saying.  There's no prioritization in the legal system. There are some things that should be addressed soon.  have to wait that long. But so then came down to one week prior to the hearing and 

Recording: (8934/ 10721) 
 Oh my. 

Recording: (8935/ 10721) 
 We want a dog and we've kind of been waiting. But I like both animals. 

Recording: (8936/ 10721) 
 because the larger story was too large to film in one movie. But this one as a part of a whole, I'm reserving  complete judgment until 

Recording: (8937/ 10721) 
 Well, I think. 

Recording: (8938/ 10721) 
 It doesn't matter how much money they're given for their education. 

Recording: (8939/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (8940/ 10721) 
 an urban area. 

Recording: (8941/ 10721) 
 But even though you're not responsible, I'm the one that's supposed to be responsible. The people that have the beer party in the house, yeah, they should be held responsible.  to some degree, but we're in a society that loves to sue people. 

Recording: (8942/ 10721) 
 My parents are all for it. They've always been supportive of whatever we wanted. 

Recording: (8943/ 10721) 
 It's like you know, you get to know everybody. It's pretty much an apartment and the whole floor, you know, you become friends with everybody real fast. So I'm hoping that's the same deal when I travel. It's like it's easy to make  friends and hook up and say, oh you got a job, hook me up. 

Recording: (8944/ 10721) 
 And I have an office within the program now. And yeah, and it's just incredible how much I've learned. I think I learned more in that program than I do.  in all my classes put together. 

Recording: (8945/ 10721) 
 for example, so you should name her Tamara. 

Recording: (8946/ 10721) 
 get something approved through all the parameters you got to go through and everything. And then they start working on it and then they get it done. It's already 10, 15 years old. 

Recording: (8947/ 10721) 
 Can I just say yes? I like lots of stuff. I like games. 

Recording: (8948/ 10721) 
 Everything keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of scissors. 

Recording: (8949/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but they don't have it. 

Recording: (8950/ 10721) 
 I play with computers. Normally when people ask me I tell them what I did that day or what I did the day before if they ask me in the evening.  So, what did I do today? Internet Information Server is a product by Microsoft. It lets you house web pages and put them out on the web.  on the web. IndexServe is another product that lets you put search engines on that. Then there's another product by a company called SplitCycle. It's called NetStock. It sucks. NetStock 

Recording: (8951/ 10721) 
 And it's, you know, my mom, you know, she always said, well, what's, you know, what do you think I should do about this? And we always talk about different things. So I think, I think it's kind of neat that I've been involved in a lot of this.  a lot of the other kids that way. 

Recording: (8952/ 10721) 
 Oh! 

Recording: (8953/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, in a case like that, the parents should know because there's something going on. 

Recording: (8954/ 10721) 
 saying that if you have a fourth or a half 

Recording: (8955/ 10721) 
 But... 

Recording: (8956/ 10721) 
 I mean obviously being a little boy I remember seeing things like football or whatever, you'd see something.  and you thought it was neat so you'd do it or whatever. 

Recording: (8957/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (8958/ 10721) 
 And so it was kind of funny, but the discouraging, I mean it was discouraging when you see people that don't have any hope and. 

Recording: (8959/ 10721) 
 My kids went to a school where my son had already left it, but in the fourth grade they announced, took all the kids in the auditorium and said, we're closing next year.  And it was hard, but once it's reached the point that decision is made and announced, then there were good reasons for it.  And they explain the reasons and at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something. 

Recording: (8960/ 10721) 
 Usually every weekend. 

Recording: (8961/ 10721) 
 Every kid that my kid ran around with, I knew his parents, one way or the other. 

Recording: (8962/ 10721) 
 I thought it was very strange, but. 

Recording: (8963/ 10721) 
 It's just older artists, more established artists. 

Recording: (8964/ 10721) 
 Do you have one now? 

Recording: (8965/ 10721) 
 Is that just because of the wall? Go visit the wall.  What do you think?  I think I remember that, when they took down the wall, the Brandenburg Gates or something like that. I remember hearing that.  Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8966/ 10721) 
 Like I had my kids last week, I had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And then I had them one by one come up to the table in the front. They didn't know I was going to do this. So after they got it all done,  I go out and I get my little bag of stuff and I bring in my bread, my peanut butter, my jelly, and I sit them down beside me and I go, okay, now, no ad-libbing, no adding, no taking away, read exactly what I'm saying.  what you wrote. 

Recording: (8967/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8968/ 10721) 
 why people 

Recording: (8969/ 10721) 
 Kent Merker, which are a couple of guys that did get signed professionally and are playing right now. So at least I can say I played against them.  him and at least with Kent Merker I can say I hit a home run off him so it was a while ago but it was when he was young  and very good and I was three or four years older and still took him deep to center field. So I'll never forget that. 

Recording: (8970/ 10721) 
 I know, I know, I know. I mean, I started. 

Recording: (8971/ 10721) 
 where Northland is. 

Recording: (8972/ 10721) 
 Well the thing, I mean, I know when my mom, my mom has a friend that adopted. 

Recording: (8973/ 10721) 
 Yeah, meet different people. 

Recording: (8974/ 10721) 
 Well, that's not their sperm or whatever that is they sell For ten thousand dollars a piece and be implanted another so they take and produce a quote beautiful child  Well, a beautiful child, and if you're talking about just the physical features, is meaningless. It's what is embodied in the child.  that body that can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at. And that to me is abhorrent. 

Recording: (8975/ 10721) 
 So they spent all these thousands of dollars on airfare and they're still coming out ahead. Maybe they should get to one of those Las Vegas chapel weddings and do like a drive-thru.  They really want to do it on the cheap. I didn't have Elvis as a performance ceremony. That's crazy. 

Recording: (8976/ 10721) 
 kill. 

Recording: (8977/ 10721) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (8978/ 10721) 
 I hadn't heard that one. Well, I did see on TV late news after you'd gone to bed last night I saw where there's another airplane went down as it took  off from Kennedy Airport. It was an Egyptian airline, wasn't it? And he had come to New York, Kennedy Airport, and he flew all the way across the United States to California for some reason. And I went back all the way over here  And then it just taken off and what were they not even a half an hour or whatever out in the ocean? We're out all over the ocean and all wants to play went boom in 30 seconds or something. I mean it 

Recording: (8979/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8980/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8981/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8982/ 10721) 
 But, you know, I think what they did was fairly good. They didn't really, as far as I remember, at that point at least, they didn't  well, they must have gone into the sort of moral issue. But what I remember was more of a scientific approach. 

Recording: (8983/ 10721) 
 whatever his name is, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's into his kind of movies. I like Sixth Sense. I love that movie. 

Recording: (8984/ 10721) 
 Well, I didn't know if you'd give them my name or... Yeah, there's a variety of places. Yeah, I could give you a name to the main secretary.  If you can. 

Recording: (8985/ 10721) 
 I know I wasn't. 

Recording: (8986/ 10721) 
 You know.

 I didn't mean to do that. Yeah.

 He hasn't questioned me like that, but I see a lot of things coming out. He's doing more in line. He's been doing things a lot more differently than my daughter, because my daughter was away at school, and he  He's with us every day, he stays home, he doesn't want to stay on campus. He does things voluntarily, we don't have to coach him.  team 

Recording: (8989/ 10721) 
 It is, what a small world. 

Recording: (8990/ 10721) 
 I'm from Columbus, Ohio. I was born and raised in Columbus. I grew up on the east side of Columbus. I graduated from high school.  I then started working for Ohio State in 1977 and have been here for 24 years. 

Recording: (8991/ 10721) 
 Until they start getting a little bit better equipment, because the equipment is really ancient. There's stuff there that's older than I am. But, like, Port Columbus is getting a new tower.  It's supposed to be done in about three and a half years and the equipment they're getting is all brand new stuff. It's not like they're taking all the old junk we've got and moving it over there. So, you know, that will help.  and nationwide they're also putting new stuff in but the bad part is is picture your father is your father computer literate okay 

Recording: (8992/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I went to Columbus Public Schools. Always over on the west side, same area of town. Always lived there. I live there now.  Came up here to OSU, got my bachelor's in English Lit, and then went to Case Western Reserve for a master's.  Then I decided I wanted to go somewhere else in the country, which I got my library degree, and the only job I could find was here in Columbus. 

Recording: (8993/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8994/ 10721) 
 You know, it happened like in the same year, 88. But it was pretty tough, but I just didn't deal with it properly.  I should have went and got counseling. Well, I probably should have got marriage counseling, but I refused to do that. I didn't think I had a problem with it. She was a wonderful woman. 

Recording: (8995/ 10721) 
 That's right. They just said they just asked it the wrong way. 

Recording: (8996/ 10721) 
 and then I'll start running this campaign. Then I'll kind of read up on it, but I haven't really. 

Recording: (8997/ 10721) 
 read the paper, and have the TV off. There's something I think I might want to, I might be interested in. So I just do all those things and do my machine.

 No.

 All of them, the university is divided up in different areas and there's a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas.  about 20 buildings or so. Ours is in the northeast area from Wexner down through the Oval to I don't know about  Derby or so around in there and then on over to Woodruff 

Recording: (9000/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I do. And if I read it every day, I try to. And I go to church, I have all sorts of activities.  I do and I'm just always feeling like I'm reinforced that it's not just some sort of flaky idea that it's for me that  that it's real and it just always makes sense. That's important to me that I feel like it makes sense. 

Recording: (9001/ 10721) 
 Uh huh, uh huh. 

Recording: (9002/ 10721) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (9003/ 10721)

 You

 or some kind of tax program. 

Recording: (9013/ 10721) 
 You can get in huge arguments. People are like, no, you're lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died, you would want them dead. And honestly, I can honestly say I would not want that to happen to them.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9023/ 10721) 
 Well, I work part time, kind of, because I worked full time when he was one. And I didn't know. I felt like.  the babysitters or whoever saw him more than I did. I love my son more than anything in the world and I felt like he needed me. So I went down to part-time  I'm struggling more, but I'd rather see my son have me, you know. 

Recording: (9024/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I just like doing it and I have a good set. My best friend is a realtor. She's since retired, but it's so funny because she would always go through all these statistics.  and this and that because the stuff I've done is in and because I live in area and so she would say oh I don't know and she said well how much do you have to get it for and how much  And I would say, oh, I don't know. I think if I get it for under $150, I probably can sell it for $140 if I do this, this, this, and this. Now, you're going to put a lot of money into that, though. It's not like you're still only getting 

Recording: (9025/ 10721)

 Aww, that's nice. 

Recording: (9029/ 10721) 
 I think they're retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or I don't know. 

Recording: (9030/ 10721) 
 Well, because I've been in public schools all my life and I should be the first to know that there's a lot of favoritism, you know.  Some teachers will teach one but not teach the other. 

Recording: (9031/ 10721) 
 the arts, it was called. And that was interesting. It's kind of an underclass of teachers. They don't pay  enough to do that. They pay you per student contact hour and in my case  chemistry class I was teaching I think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like 21 or 22 

Recording: (9032/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9033/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9034/ 10721)

 Yeah. 

Recording: (9036/ 10721) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (9037/ 10721) 
 and I don't really think it's something that needs to be taught. The only thing probably is like, what do they call that?  cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take I think. That I don't think is such a bad idea because just because you grew up in  I don't know what I grew up in but I'll give an example I didn't grow up in let's say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to

 Yeah, but some names are just like, we had a friend once, she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they didn't have  never expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy.

 Yes, but there's nobody at home but my sister and I so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so I just figured something weird's going on. I didn't know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce related.  they didn't just basically dumb because the divorce wasn't going to phase me because the entire marriage was We knew we knew from the beginning that was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable  So we're just kind of waiting around going. They're gonna be doors for a couple months and sure enough. So anyway So I look at these people and their names are the

I just feel that would be the right thing to do, punch them in the mouth sometimes. I'm not a violent man either.  as big as I am, you know, so.

 where they're almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they're geared specifically towards black people. And I think in a way that's  some  30, 40 years ago, where they had their white organizations or whatnot. And I think it's sort of going along the same lines. 

Recording: (9048/ 10721) 
 I don't think so.

 Right. Yeah, well you can't even put a price on it either.

 to all of the stuff and then you pretend that you're a jury and come up with a decision. And I guess they use it in forming their case and going into court. So that's fun. So that's a little bit about me.  My family, my mom and dad, well, my mother was first generation American, my grandparents came to this country from Hungary, and that was a neat experience. I liked growing up there.  up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in Hungary. He thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me. I still do

 value and why are you doing this to my kid. So I think that's missing and that's a problem within the school the public schools.  So it just seems to be more distraction from the educational process. When you're in a Catholic school and you're in a classroom, they deal with the discipline if they need to.  Of course, part of the way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools. But in the public schools, you just have to deal with this all the time. 

Recording: (9076/ 10721) 
 you know. So unfortunately, you know, and I guess I never thought of it, a lot more pressure is put on schools and education now. 

Recording: (9077/ 10721) 
 and I was more surprised that they found a lot of alcohol. You know, some people, if they do drugs at school and stuff.  I'm not saying that's right, but they'll do it. But alcohol, it'd be so hard to hide because it smells and you've got to hold it out. But they found bottles of liquor.

Recording: (9081/ 10721) 
 Well, see, my husband would do that. It's so bizarre because I honestly don't. I think that's where his brain is completely lacking. I get to  make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can't do. And we all understand this and it's perfectly fine. And he says, I'm not a good judge of that.  I

If it is not that now, it's  worse yet it's the kids are on the internet now that's even worse because now you can't even hear what they're getting into at least on TV you could walk in and sit and turn it off now you can go in I guess and  see what they're on the internet, honestly, now, sorry, you can't in the internet anymore, but I think those are all really, they can be good influences if they've got the right program,

 I can't say that really bothered me. Like I said, it's something that's his choice, his opinion and whatnot. I mean, it's up to him. It doesn't affect  the nation any or anything like that. I mean, he's still, as long as he's making the right decisions or whatever, then

 You know, so that's the reason I had to quit. It was like if I could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself,  I would have been okay, but that wasn't how it worked. So I had to pull back from it.

 I'm tired of that. I come home, get in the car, go somewhere, you know, or come home, get something to eat. But I think  I think that has a lot to do with it. I don't really know that TV has that much because I remember coming home as a kid and watching Howdy Doody and all that stuff.  Of course, it wasn't the violent stuff maybe you can see on TV now, but I don't really think the media has had that much to do with it.

Where you get around campus, you know, it's a lot. I mean, it's all hustle, hustle, hustle.  hustle, but down here even with the kids and everything going to school, but basically it's kind of laid back.

 and I had to get out. In other ones, it's a struggle with that thing and understanding it. It takes time to understand it. A lot of people  lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it. I was trying to let the fear of that, though I'm not afraid  to die. I'm afraid sometimes that I'll die before I get a chance to do what I feel I was sent here to do, which is just the basic things. 

Recording: (9204/ 10721) 
 They ain't gonna lock me up. 

Recording: (9205/ 10721)

Recording: (9221/ 10721)

He wanted everything to be the same.  changed everything. It does. Your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody's listening and everything you want to do somebody's 

Recording: (9222/ 10721) 
 Mm-mm.

 So, because he and I always discussed politics and stuff.

 Yes, exactly. 

Recording: (9225/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9226/ 10721) 
 which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses right around the park of roses and those types of things, you can get some that are older that need a lot of work.  but that's a pretty high demand area.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9231/ 10721) 
 we start them over again. They have never learned. And the reason why you're throwing a carrot out too much in front of them without saying, hey, you got to do this to prove this to me. No, we've  In fact, one heck of a lot of ethical, moral standards in this country, we're losing it every day until we start looking ourselves in the mirror at night and say,  of myself. I'm proud of what I did. I may not have made a dollar a day, but I understood somebody today. 

Recording: (9232/ 10721) 
 My oldest son was in Vietnam.

Recording: (9237/ 10721) 
 God, I've seen a few infomercials on stuff like that, but I can't say anything too serious to come up from it. 

Recording: (9238/ 10721) 
 Appeals, appeals. 

Recording: (9239/ 10721) 
 Yeah, just since March. 

Recording: (9240/ 10721) 
 light news. That's why I tend to read alternative newspapers and stuff, because you do get a different perspective. It's probably  just a slanted, but it is different. You're right. 

Recording: (9241/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9242/ 10721) 
 Yeah.

 Cross-dressing. Not cross-dressing. When two men live together and two women live together,  Two women live together, what do you call it? Homosexual. Gays. Oh, okay. Is that the same thing?  I 

Recording: (9245/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it got into a situation where you really weren't, there was a no-win situation from the get-go. And I think that had we been able to do what we were able to do,  went over there to do initially, it would have worked out okay, but we weren't, so it became a political war, as everybody knows. 

Recording: (9246/ 10721) 
 highly skilled or trained in that area. I mean, you can't really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad. And again, as I mentioned  previously, I think it's more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of the different students with each other.  I mean, if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be. I mean, you're never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different 

Recording: (9247/ 10721) 
 You know I said to myself because I had postpartum depression with my third and fourth child and I thought what good am I going to be to  these children if I'm not able to take care of them. So the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control.  And I felt comfortable with that. 

Recording: (9248/ 10721) 
 for that, so he got locked up and he's not allowed to see another human being. 

Recording: (9249/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9250/ 10721) 
 he's finding things for his family thing I said you will I found one of them way back and what was it 1670 or something this boatload of people come over from England and they were the ones that  had been deported from England because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or were the thief or something and I said would you read the only person I can find in my family is nothing but  but a convict. He even got deported from the country. I don't know why he was there, but that's the ship he was on. 

Recording: (9251/ 10721) 
 Yes. And where are you from? Well, I was raised most of my life in Ashland. It's about 10 minutes north of Mansfield,  Ohio. We moved there from Mansfield. I've been living in the Mansfield  area for

 aren't really saying much new, but if they have a more compact time they could be. So I'd like to see them, see the time reduced. The conventions used to be interesting because they debated  to platforms and that's all settled now. And it's just sort of a, you know, this celebration type stuff. Well, that's not interesting.  It could change and move the primaries, like to me. 

Recording: (9253/ 10721) 
 Well, I think the people that made that law should also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it. 

Recording: (9254/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (9255/ 10721) 
 Okay, well, just call me Rachel and I'm 24. I've got a two year old son, has just had his birthday, the 31st.  So, and I live by myself in a house and I work in the county department. 

Recording: (9256/ 10721) 
 Right. So a lot of them already believe that they have their own religion and they're really faithful. So that was one of the main problems.  that they had been so holding on to that for so long, it's so strong, they don't want to let go of.  well, and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (9257/ 10721) 
 that I finally just said, OK, we're going to start training people to make money with computers. 

Recording: (9258/ 10721) 
 I just do it for the stretch. It's almost like when I'm laying there and Kathy's saying, you know, take it, even though I sound speedy. 

Recording: (9259/ 10721) 
 He always preached, get a union job. 

Recording: (9260/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (9261/ 10721) 
 Three years, something like that. Hard to remember. It was a long time ago. 

Recording: (9262/ 10721) 
 Hehe. 

Recording: (9263/ 10721) 
 They were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it. And pretty much all the other problems, well, there weren't really  too many other problems. I mean the economy's doing really well and foreign relations are always shaky but they're getting  Getting a little bit better. 

Recording: (9264/ 10721) 
 I know the way we dressed and everything was kind of appalling to the parents and everything. I guess maybe that's where I'm coming from.  of the kids dress, you know, retro back to with the bell bottoms and everything to us and the piercings  I just can't get into that, you know. And some of the girls, I mean, they, you know, I mean, my guy date, 14, 6, 15 years old. 

Recording: (9265/ 10721) 
 Maybe at the underlying base. 

Recording: (9266/ 10721) 
 Or they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school. 

Recording: (9267/ 10721) 
 I actually joined the church in, well I don't know, six years ago, about six years ago, and they did a survey here at LSU and they were just asking people  if they thought that Christ had visited America and there was a record of that account. Do I think that would be important? And I was like, well, I think so, yeah.  I was kind of hesitant. I mean, it took me a while. I read the Book of Mormon and I really prayed about it. 

Recording: (9268/ 10721) 
 pretty soon you see all the money they've been making gone. 

Recording: (9269/ 10721) 
 through downtown and it would take me an hour and 45 minutes in the snow to get down there and if I could if I could jump on this rail system and it would take me 15 minutes and I wouldn't have to  to pay $50 a month for parking, why not do that? And there's also the whole pollution thing and those types of things. So I thought that was. 

Recording: (9270/ 10721) 
 second and third. I was working 16-hour days a lot of times covering. That's one of the reasons they weren't going to move me. 

Recording: (9271/ 10721) 
 I don't intend to ever leave here, so... 

Recording: (9272/ 10721) 
 So it was one of those. 

Recording: (9273/ 10721) 
 No, they're not. It's printed at the top on every issue that they are financially independent. 

Recording: (9274/ 10721) 
 I mean, yes, some people. 

Recording: (9275/ 10721) 
 I think I remember like they were like remodeling a few years back. Is that right? 

Recording: (9276/ 10721) 
 yeah that's kinda odd, kinda like think of a factory like a punch card or something but um and just how uh like there's this whole thing like we can't wear  hats and in the building and this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff. It's just real funny to hear people speak like that and really believe it. 

Recording: (9277/ 10721) 
 I'm going to get done with this, I swear. 

Recording: (9278/ 10721) 
 bring what's in your heart out. And sometimes you'll say stuff that doesn't even make sense, but you say it, and it brings it out.  And that's what it's for. So I mean it's it's a struggle understanding that and I Made it through all four rounds this time  And I even sat up, which was the first time. It's a struggle.  but 

Recording: (9279/ 10721) 
 I can't. 

Recording: (9280/ 10721) 
 It's right on their main street and they have gorgeous, really neat, unique things. 

Recording: (9281/ 10721) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (9282/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. I've had I got a couple three applications in about the Kroger's and a day's worth of job for San Angelo  nursing home which I kind of like doing stuff for people that like that you know I worked at a custodian at st. Robby I was a  home for the aged, but I had a problem dealing with a one-on-one basis with the older patients because they were just visiting, you know, they weren't there to stay. 

Recording: (9283/ 10721) 
 And we were staying at his grandpa's, and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and say all kinds of racial slurs towards black people. 

Recording: (9284/ 10721) 
 But yet, that leaves a door open for who to get in trouble. 

Recording: (9285/ 10721) 
 Moss, Bill Moss, he's always saying, oh, this is racist and that's racist. But I don't think it's too bad in Columbus. I know there are places lots worse.  like the South and so on, of course. Who really knows the race issue is such a big question. 

Recording: (9286/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9287/ 10721) 
 I don't know just exactly where the others are, but they're here in the Columbus area. 

Recording: (9288/ 10721) 
 communicate as you say through the internet and to businesses but we don't have compassion and we don't have commitment  Without those three, you'll never have success. 

Recording: (9289/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (9290/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9291/ 10721) 
 No, my mom's, she's not an invalid. She's 72 years old, but they go out usually to yard sales and stuff like that, stuff I don't wanna do. 

Recording: (9292/ 10721) 
 Yeah because of the traffic. But see where I live I could get on the bus if I just wanted to go downtown real bad. 

Recording: (9293/ 10721) 
 and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid's gonna hate you. 

Recording: (9294/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's I'm surprised they're not getting the lot  of heat from that but because that park's been there forever. 

Recording: (9295/ 10721) 
 you should you should be organized I'm not I have this stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting next to my bed just  I'm gonna go out and buy groceries and then the commons open again 

Recording: (9296/ 10721) 
 country music doesn't mean if somebody doesn't do that they're not okay. I think that would be a good idea or you know cultures are different. So if you want to view that as a  culture or you know what I mean that that is something different except the people you don't have to like what they're doing but they're still people.  So. 

Recording: (9297/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (9298/ 10721) 
 She doesn't try to get her daughter back. She has visitation with her. I love her very, very much.  know that way emotionally but boy I'd like for her mom to take her back yeah you know I'm fortunate because I got a grant for her through the Y  YMCA, at a very nice learning center that she goes to every day.  you 

Recording: (9299/ 10721) 
 right? 

Recording: (9300/ 10721) 
 or more accurately, I think she took it, but it's a fine line. And so she wears that around and I replaced it. So I have my own again. I wear this one around. So we have  competition to see who can get the most well-traveled ring. You get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country. 

Recording: (9301/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you still have to be careful.

 from you, he gives something back. I've had kids who've got every badge you can get in Boy Scouts. There's usually something that might not be related  to school, but there's usually something that they're really, really good at in some other area, like swimming or scouting or whatever.  So they, you know, but generally speaking, they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with

Recording: (9309/ 10721) 
 I've always thought that it ends up being a personal decision. 

Recording: (9310/ 10721) 
 Scary. Okay. And it was funny because you see the cops first, but in reality the cops are behind two other people that I actually know. But it doesn't matter because you always see cops first.  So the two other people that I actually know are my stepmother's parents. Stepmother and father have been split up for  I don't know a month or two now. They've been married for something like six months now and my sister and I both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she was making a horrible mistake but 

Recording: (9311/ 10721) 
 Well, see, we have real traditional breakdown of chores, but only because that's just happened to be what we liked it, the way we like it.  Do you know what I mean? And it's not because, you know, I consider my whole household a lot of feminists. You know, we're all real strong about that. But the thing is, since I have the luxury  of being at home and Peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and I am doing something I enjoy, I really am happy to do all of those things

 Yeah, pretty interesting. Everybody talks and frequently nobody's listening. It's and yeah, it's pretty interesting.  Talking about how they don't have the money for this and they don't have the money for that and then somebody comes up with, well let's spend the money over on something else and nobody acts on it and they go on to something else.

 I don't think so. I don't think they did. But there was this other guy my mom was talking about the other day. I don't know what she's seen it on. I guess he  he had did something like that and he was just listing, they did like an interview with him and told them how much things he'd  did like he did this and that and I guess he broke into bank once or something like that and got some accounts or something like that. I was like whoa. Yeah.  you

 I do. I am against religion in school. I just don't think they should push that on people. I don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class  or anything like that, but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what's out there. Most kids know what the wrong thing is. 

Recording: (9339/ 10721) 
 That's where you need to correct. You can't just say, hey, we got a schnook out here we can screw him. That's a problem. And you're saying, does it take home? Does it take church? It takes  It's morals. And that's why I was telling you before, we got away from morals in our society. We could care less about you.

 First year, finishing it up. Oh yeah. Oh it's definitely the.  the beginning. 

Recording: (9342/ 10721) 
 Well, I never really think I had, first of all, I didn't have the motivation, I don't think, to put in the effort to do it, but I don't think I had very good advisors when I was  first hair. I didn't really understand the idea that UBC was separate from art college and that you had to apply. I didn't really know. I just was like,  OK. 

Recording: (9343/ 10721) 
 like just like um like communal showers and stuff and like um just how it's like one room  that you like, kind of live in or whatever, you know? It's more like the army or something, you know? Like real simple, everything's real simple and everything's uniform and like, I don't know.

 What kind of shoes did you wear in the summer? He said, we didn't wear any shoes. Aha. And then I told him how we didn't either. I came from a very large family.  mostly boys, we would take our shoes off as soon as we could in the springtime. We would store  them in tallow, in jars of tallow. Tallow is lamb lard, if you want to call it that. And that was a preservative.

 in any way defending the guys who did it, but something is wrong not only with them, but in the fact that they  were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you know that you would even think of doing something like that.  I don't know, especially with everything that was said about the families and they didn't seem to, of course you never really

Well, I did to her exactly what I said I was gonna do. I was gonna watch her draw her last breath. He killed her Now he's gonna go and probably maybe a plea bargain and he'll get  off with it because maybe he was abused as a child and that had something to do with the way he was thinking. What happened to this woman because of it? I'm sorry. Let him pay the penalty.

 Some of them just look like cracker box houses that they put up in a week or something. It's amazing how you can drive by and then in  two weeks drive by and there's 50 homes. Because there's a lot of growth in Hilliard. Hilliard's that's starting to scare us actually a little bit because now they just build another  another whole high school, so two whole high schools. I think they were up to 2,000 or 3,000 senior graduates last year. 

Recording: (9365/ 10721) 
 If it's not a necessity, I'll have to forfeit it right now. Well, a lot of them want the necessities, they also want some of the extras. And in order to do that, both have to work. Well, consequently, who's really raising the kids?  If they're lucky, they've got a loving grandparent. 99 times out of 100, I don't know if that's a good statistic, it's the babysitters or these places.  It's not a babysitter, it's a babysitter school or something like that. And that's not the same loving, cuddling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids.  you

Just all the trauma that goes along with it, not just the physical trauma, I mean that was enough to  kill anybody but because of me, because of my size, because of my strength, I wasn't killed.  you

 Hate crime is an interesting term. All crimes, all murders are hate related. I'm not sure  It's difficult. We had civil rights laws. Many people were opposed to those.  but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism.

 Well, sure.

 I mean I could skate on our driveway but it stops abruptly in stones. So it gets real boring. I mean going downhills is really fun but going back up is a pain in the neck.  But there's a lot more people here. I like lots of people. I've discovered I like having lots of people around me to  all sorts of new and interesting and unique people. Every year there's a whole new crowd of freshmen that come in and it's pretty cool.

 you I can still be your friend. Which is sort of what I try and emanate because I'm very very religious and the Christian community is very  is. I'm not gonna say can be. I say they are. Christian community is very, very mean towards homosexuals, and that's just not right.  I mean, they're people. They're making a mistake in my eyes, yes, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna look at them any differently as human beings. They deserve my respect. 

Recording: (9391/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9392/ 10721) 
 It's like a car dealer that goes, you know, the CD player with blah, blah, blah, blah, will only raise your payment another $8. And you're like, yeah, but that's...  That's about the 14th $8 you've added on to this, and it all adds up.

 Weekends I usually try and keep free so that I can mix stuff up. I don't know. Weekends are usually the one day of the week that isn't horribly well  scheduled. Wednesday nights are preparing for travel. 

Recording: (9400/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9401/ 10721) 
 Why I don't know. It doesn't make sense. 

Recording: (9402/ 10721) 
 I think so, yeah, like their haircuts are a certain way and you have to shave and you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can.  Unless it's really hot. It's different also depending on the climate. 

Recording: (9403/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I hear about suicide rates when they don't get in, but... 

Recording: (9404/ 10721) 
 whatever. So we refer them to those doctors. And then if this doctor, those doctors are pretty conservative too. And if they put them on meds, it's usually just for the school  day, not during the summer, not over vacation, not after 5 o'clock, not on the weekends, and it's just to help them focus. And then these doctors also  so

 He had an aneurysm. He had high blood pressure, which we knew about.  He started, you know, not being himself, so he went to the doctor and they did some tests and found out he had this aneurysm that had  to be operated on right away, and he died under the anesthetic of a heart attack.  you 

Recording: (9408/ 10721) 
 I like it. I've only lived in the northern end. I've lived in Dublin and Old Worthington and now Hilliard, which is kind of around the side.  But I like it because it has its own little well, especially worth into its own little city within a city

Recording: (9412/ 10721) 
 Well he uses it when he has like car problems or something he tends to like to drive his own car. You know they have to park so far away. 

Recording: (9413/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, but let's face it, people that have the real good guns are the people that shouldn't have the guns, meaning crime and whatnot.  I don't have a problem with people having guns but we don't need 60 guns per person or whatever the ratio is. It's something  and ungodly like that. And they keep making them. I mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture. We did need to hunt to eat.

 Yeah, it was pretty much upper middle class.

 You'd be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks. 

Recording: (9417/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. Yeah. Right. And you know what's going to happen? It's only when it gets so bad that they can't even walk to  to  shocked and they're the ones that are going to be panicked when everything, you know, because it's getting smaller, the world's getting smaller, we're more populated now than we ever have been.

Recording: (9430/ 10721) 
 I think so. 

Recording: (9431/ 10721) 
 It's like, oh. 

Recording: (9432/ 10721) 
 It's magnified and or yeah, they have that choice they can say well listen you don't understand and blah blah blah and I've tried that but  But the best I can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen. I hear what you're saying, but I'm trying to show you that  and tell you how I work best. So as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedom. 

Recording: (9433/ 10721) 
 No, that's true. 

Recording: (9434/ 10721) 
 My answer to your question is, has this eroded? I'm going to answer using the word respect.  Yes, I feel that this has eroded over time. There's not the respect for our elders.  I don't necessarily mean elders in terms of the chronological age, but I'm talking in terms of generations. 

Recording: (9435/ 10721) 
 No, I'm a business major and I hear the business school here is pretty good. So I wanted to take a look at that. My roommate's a business major so he was going to show me around. They have new buildings I guess.  So he said he'd show me around there. Also, I really do, like I came down for a few games and things like that and I like the enthusiasm that people have for this place.  so small, there's a select group that has enthusiasm, but nothing like here. I mean, this is ridiculous. Everyone's just enthusiastic about the university. Even 

Recording: (9436/ 10721) 
 when the freeway was built, I-70 was built through town. And a lot of times you don't realize what kind of havoc that creates when a  freeways built through the middle of a town because you have to take out a lot of houses to do that and you can sort of realize that if you ever go around the area  and go to one of the little side streets that dead ends because the freeways there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been 20 or 

Recording: (9437/ 10721) 
 And it was just when drug culture was just starting, we learned about it in school and stuff. But no, my parents never sat down with me. Or about smoking. I mean, I never really smoked.  today with teenagers and everything so out in the open, you have to talk to them about things and just say, you know, I want to help you and I, you know, be there for them 100%. Obviously, those  parents were too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing. So I think they're the ones to be to blame, I do. 

Recording: (9438/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9439/ 10721) 
 No, the lifestyle was very easy to fit into and I've always been interested in the whole European culture.  I think the most difficult was actually because I was studying English when I went there.  I was in and studying English in America or in England is, you know, sort of, I don't know, more sort of elitist, which I didn't realize

 Mm-hmm.

 have created a system whereby it won't be as good for those people as it has been  and the ones who are genuinely unemployable. But I think depending on how sort of focused they are on  the individuals in their area or whatever, however it's divided up. I don't know, hopefully not special treatment, but 

Recording: (9442/ 10721) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (9443/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9444/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9445/ 10721) 
 Ah, why? And this, and here I come from, this is a gentleman that's dark skinned. I don't know if he's black or colored.  I'm still confused as to what difference in black and color it is. But he says, my brothers probably came to these islands, to the Continental.  They come down here and they're getting all they're swaying themselves. They're acting cocky to me and so forth I say  you 

Recording: (9446/ 10721) 
 Turn the music up, it's already blasting.

 a week. 

Recording: (9448/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9449/ 10721) 
 I mean just like Beauty and the Beast, there's an extreme amount of violence in there. You know, just every one there's a bad, dark,  side in the story. So children just start, and I mean it's in there. And then including my own daughter, she and  And I swear, I had her watch Mr. Rogers all the time. But now that she's older, she watches TV. 

Recording: (9450/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9451/ 10721) 
 I'm retired. 

Recording: (9452/ 10721) 
 I remember it being a pretty positive thing for me. I was never upset about the fact that they weren't together because they both gave me a lot of attention.  About I think I was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in German village 

Recording: (9453/ 10721) 
 Well, somehow or other, yeah. And if everybody would just begin to build that way, and when they start to say something nasty, you would think, would I want them to say that to me? 

Recording: (9454/ 10721) 
 And so I get a lot of you know what from my sisters. 

Recording: (9455/ 10721) 
 little out of the way backwards okay yeah  to do the tourist thing.  I don't know.  I'm not sure. 

Recording: (9456/ 10721) 
 Oh, that's good. That's good. 

Recording: (9457/ 10721) 
 But we still need to have property management records. That's very essential. And a lot of times when you're talking to engineers, they don't realize that part of it. They don't like the detail.  aspect of it. But we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how your facilities are structured, the time history, any type of  of 

Recording: (9458/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (9459/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9460/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (9461/ 10721) 
 You know, like there are two fishermen that found him at sea. You never hear about the other one because this was on one, just briefly I heard on the news, because he thinks he should go back to his father. But you don't hear about him.  There's three cousins. Two of them think he should stay in Miami. The other one thinks he should go back with his father. You don't hear about him. He's reading about him in Newsweek or someplace.  So I think the news media has not been totally objective about this. 

Recording: (9462/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's a lot smaller than Columbus though 

Recording: (9463/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. You know, even within marriage, it's just like... Taboo, yeah. 

Recording: (9464/ 10721) 
 I mean, as far as that goes, there's really nothing more he can do. 

Recording: (9465/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I was cutting 20 pounds in three days. 

Recording: (9466/ 10721) 
 I wish I knew the answer, but reality, I just feel sorry for the people that not only feel that they have to do that.  But also for the people that are involved in it and the other, those victims and everything and their parents and everything. The only one I really had to, I was really upset with,  the Columbine deal and that was because the one kid was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents knew nothing 

Recording: (9467/ 10721) 
 um because he he likes he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and I smack his hands for that and I try not to yell but it's  Yeah, I try to talk to him. 

Recording: (9468/ 10721) 
 Oh, no, I don't feel that at all. We don't hesitate to get together with other friends and take our kids places. I don't remember my dad doing that stuff.  You know, two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or something, you know. I don't remember things like that. It could have been there maybe, but. 

Recording: (9469/ 10721) 
 In terms of government, we weren't ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy, one woman who was decisive and made  decisions and we wouldn't go along with her, you know. But if we could get ourselves to the place where it would work, that would be  be great and I would very much and I then and the year that I lived in that community was one of the best years of my life. 

Recording: (9470/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9471/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9472/ 10721) 
 Okay, how do you get back to the original without being part of the original? 

Recording: (9473/ 10721) 
 Yeah, a lot of educated people who aren't out to just make a bunch of money. So it makes for a very intellectual environment.  interesting environment, but people are trying to live simply there. And I kind of agree with that.  Hehehehehehe 

Recording: (9474/ 10721) 
 So, but I had some really tough, challenging jobs. And yeah, if I knew now what I knew then, I probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different, yeah, experience with.  sexual harassment. 

Recording: (9475/ 10721) 
 Oh, you have to nowadays. I don't understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home, plus has a full-time job. That just doesn't happen.  now now you know if your wife didn't work you could expect these things but she's doing 40 hours a week too so it is  It's work and it's a full-time job. They start, the seven-year-old just brought it, here it is, the end of the year, second grade, she brings home this project. 

Recording: (9476/ 10721) 
 I can argue both sides of that. I'm at a luxury I guess where we're in a position where I truly don't have to work. So if I ever felt that he was in  jeopardy or he wasn't getting what he wanted or needed, I would quit in a heartbeat to take care of that. But having family with him the first  I got all my schooling, everything out of the way. I cut down to the 60% when he was 

Recording: (9477/ 10721) 
 With the children, yeah. 

Recording: (9478/ 10721) 
 Help them. 

Recording: (9479/ 10721) 
 personally I think it's too late because they can get things on the internet. There's just so many avenues for them to find  and violence and pornography and things that when I was growing up there was no way I could see any of that stuff. I had good parents but I was  into Lassie and Tom and Jerry. But they weren't violent and they made you feel good after you watched them. But I just think, I don't think you 

Recording: (9480/ 10721) 
 I've been there twice already. 

Recording: (9481/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean, getting a gun doesn't seem- I mean, I was surprised, like, I would- I've never owned a gun, but I'm- I think it's pretty easy to get one, actually. 

Recording: (9482/ 10721) 
 Oh, it was on Saturday? 

Recording: (9483/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there's burning couches and over by Pearl Alley there's actually rolling a Volkswagen down the alley.  There's all kinds of people doing it. 

Recording: (9484/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm.

 Oh no, we just had a whole conversation, come on now. 

Recording: (9492/ 10721) 
 It only took, the last one I did was on Richards Road, which is right across from Whetstone Park. 

Recording: (9493/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I mean it's like it's known but it's in a different way. It's like a different type of fame than like traditional style. So It's like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it's more  more of like a it's not like an MTV type thing you know 

Recording: (9494/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it actually is his dad's mother babysits. 

Recording: (9495/ 10721) 
 Well... 

Recording: (9496/ 10721) 
 I just think it's a different time now. I don't think, I think everybody's living more for today and talking about the future, you know, hoping that the future's there. I think there's a  quote-unquote in time aspect to life, you know. 

Recording: (9497/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9498/ 10721) 
 like you mean sexual relationships and what? Probably the bad things about it, yeah. But just coming from my Christian beliefs  and whatnot. The best thing, and I know it, even though I didn't partake in it when I was a teenager and I wasn't promiscuous at all, but I still had sex before marriage.  Just to be it'd be nice if they teach you how to be confident in yourself, and I don't mean like self-esteem, but you know like we said if 

Recording: (9499/ 10721) 
 I really am not educated into that at all, so I wouldn't probably say anything since I'm ignorant in the field.  you 

Recording: (9500/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9501/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (9502/ 10721) 
 And it didn't turn out very well, so they switched it over to me for a variety of reasons, which was not entirely the university's fault.  They had to rely on confidential information, which we couldn't give them because it was confidential.  law it was confidential, we couldn't give it to them, but they needed it. So it was just not a good way to do business.  MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다. 

Recording: (9503/ 10721) 
 In what way? 

Recording: (9504/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9505/ 10721) 
 But it wasn't the worry about getting pregnant, it was the worry about getting AIDS. 

Recording: (9506/ 10721) 
 I thought maybe you would crash one of their weddings. 

Recording: (9507/ 10721) 
 All the cool apartments are on 161, all the great restaurants and everything. So that's where I lived. 

Recording: (9508/ 10721) 
 But I think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value, family value. And that will help them.  permeate the entire society. But it's got to start back here in the first and I think 

Recording: (9509/ 10721) 
 Well, I'm saying on the whole world. And everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do, even me. I think that maybe he's found it the same way, but maybe not so much.  as I have. I thought when I retired I was going to get this done and this done and this done. And I wonder now how I went to work and still got some of these things done when I got home. And I'm sure  I'm doing it just as fast because over and over again people say I've never seen anybody with as much energy You're always doing something but and I think it's just that we don't have the time 

Recording: (9510/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well... 

Recording: (9511/ 10721) 
 and don't insult us anymore or we'll go to trial. So my attorney jumped it back up to $125,000. I couldn't take sitting there.  These guys going back and forth of what they felt I was worth. Even the arbitrator was an asshole. But that's the way that system works.  tomorrow.

 My thesis is on the Sudeten Germans, those are the Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the Second World War, and specifically I'm looking at  looking at how they perceived their condition, switching from being part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Germans being sort of the  the majority, even though they weren't the majority, but sort of the master nation within the Austro-Hungarian Empire

 I love it. 

Recording: (9515/ 10721) 
 Mmm.

 to their own guilt and so I've got two sides to that. Once they need to work because they did it.  But another side is, if we keep, I believe in the reincarnation, the law of cause and effect.  murder somebody, they will pay for that later. There's no question about that in the next life. But also, I think that they should be made

 Media has a lot of control over people, but I believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that.

 I mean, I. 

Recording: (9520/ 10721) 
 which isn't far from here. So I did that for a while, but it wasn't very satisfying.  Because I really didn't feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at Huckleberry House. 

Recording: (9521/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9522/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (9523/ 10721) 
 Yeah, right, I taught, well I was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that I've been in. 

Recording: (9524/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, I was never going to get married again. I had my house, my kids, I had already done that. I was financially secure and I wasn't even looking. One of my best  friends though at the time she saw this guy he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and I talked to this girl every day and she was like oh you have to meet him you have to meet  I was like, oh, you know, call me tomorrow. I don't want to meet anybody. So it took a long time for us to be introduced. But then as soon as we were, she was right. I mean, 

Recording: (9525/ 10721) 
 from the media, and I say media broad based, be it print media or TV, that has this culture today of,  stars and you know media of phenomenons and and they don't see the relevance and I don't think they hear from their parents like I  I did the importance of voting and that's where it comes from. Their parents don't vote. So if their parents don't vote, they aren't. Again, I don't know what the answer is. 

Recording: (9526/ 10721) 
 So... 

Recording: (9527/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9528/ 10721) 
 It's only a couple people. It's not. The majority of people I work around are black. But like I said, the majority of people I work around, I get along with great. 

Recording: (9529/ 10721) 
 been to do that. 

Recording: (9530/ 10721) 
 It's... 

Recording: (9531/ 10721) 
 no noise. I'm so used to like turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound that I have to like have music on in the room.  And not down here.  I really like the city. I like the nightlife. Everything in Ashland, Mansfield shuts down at 930, 10 o'clock and it all starts up. 

Recording: (9532/ 10721) 
 Yeah, my kids were both two weeks late, so I know how that is. 

Recording: (9533/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9534/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, herb. 

Recording: (9535/ 10721) 
 She's the type of person I love to annoy. 

Recording: (9536/ 10721) 
 Yeah, four girls. 

Recording: (9537/ 10721) 
 It's supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (9538/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, by the way, 

Recording: (9539/ 10721) 
 I'm gonna go. 

Recording: (9540/ 10721) 
 That's mean. That's why nobody brings it. 

Recording: (9541/ 10721) 
 I'm sure, I'm sure it is. You know, it's just the circles I move in. 

Recording: (9542/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9543/ 10721) 
 I got thrown out of high school 

Recording: (9544/ 10721) 
 and that sort of thing, then you're leaving out a large part of the population. So I'm not sure it's going to give valid results anyway. 

Recording: (9545/ 10721) 
 I think it fills its niche. I mean, Wexner has a niche and the museum has a niche.  and I think it fills it very well. 

Recording: (9546/ 10721) 
 right? 

Recording: (9547/ 10721) 
 Think about things. I mean, it's pretty easy to do. 

Recording: (9548/ 10721) 
 Now I go. 

Recording: (9549/ 10721) 
 It's about the same. 

Recording: (9550/ 10721) 
 No, it was just the usual things. She touched my things. Because they were far apart enough, they had their own social  social groups and their own friends and interests. So there wasn't much of that, but there was the usual, you know.  She's breathing on me in the car. He's humming too loud. I don't know if you've got brothers and sisters, but yeah, you've probably went through it all. Yeah. 

Recording: (9551/ 10721) 
 I wonder if that's also a socialized medicine there. It is socialized, isn't it? 

Recording: (9552/ 10721) 
 honest, I'm for it. It doesn't have to be, well I'm not even sure, tube stiders is pretty permanent.  But even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them $200 a year, that's still much cheaper than them having kids.  And then if they I'd give more money if they clean up their act just for them As far as it being racist, I don't think I think 

Recording: (9553/ 10721) 
 But then you'll have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery.

 That's nice. 

Recording: (9555/ 10721) 
 and  position where we're doing more advancement than anything. Our agency is the only one in the state of Ohio and the private network, the private sector is still looking at us as a showcase  We're doing voice over IP, Internet Protocol, which means we're doing voice and data over the same pipe and 

Recording: (9556/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it is. She doesn't even drive to work. 

Recording: (9557/ 10721) 
 No idea. 

Recording: (9558/ 10721) 
 And then the powers that be in the American Army decided, well, we'll go up to  to this little area of—oh, I was there the next day.  month or four months. 

Recording: (9559/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9560/ 10721) 
 to say, you know what, I'm sick of this, I'm going to shoot those people. 

Recording: (9561/ 10721) 
 I would say family, values, customs, traditions, divorce, moving, just looking at my sister,  my  Dallas. They met here, they moved to Indianapolis, they moved back here, they moved up north, they moved back. Now they're in London, England. 

Recording: (9562/ 10721) 
 Let's watch 7 to 9. 

Recording: (9563/ 10721) 
 I think it's too late. I do. 

Recording: (9564/ 10721) 
 All right, let's begin. 

Recording: (9565/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9566/ 10721) 
 I don't think I can answer that. 

Recording: (9567/ 10721) 
 see I don't shut up. So I would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than  They really could, like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and I said well you know you make sure you give it food and water and when it died I was so surprised that she  She had not been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally, but to a five-year-old, you don't get that stuff together. 

Recording: (9568/ 10721) 
 Well that gets back to what you're saying almost in the family life. Hey, what's a hat? Well, you don't need a husband. All you need is a sperm bank That's what you're saying, aren't you? Aren't you? 

Recording: (9569/ 10721) 
 It wasn't really farming country. And he went out there from Iowa where you throw a corn out in the field. 

Recording: (9570/ 10721) 
 Oh, it's just so everything, the environment of course is incredibly beautiful. And everybody is more, I think,  more open or more receptive to relationships and you know I think it's a much friendlier place.  I just think the vibrations are higher out there. You just don't have poverty. Well, if anybody's in poverty in Oregon, it's because they've chosen to live. 

Recording: (9571/ 10721) 
 Just 

Recording: (9572/ 10721) 
 it would take probably two weeks at the most before I would be working again. Yeah. 

Recording: (9573/ 10721) 
 No, I wanted to see her obviously, but. 

Recording: (9574/ 10721) 
 Oh my gosh. They don't have any of these student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty, huh? 

Recording: (9575/ 10721) 
 They just set up on a flatbed truck on Wall Street in New York and do a concert there. 

Recording: (9576/ 10721) 
 And she was from Germany, which made it a little tough because they didn't talk about those things over there at all for a long time.  then she became very open with him, but everybody knew. And that was in the 80s. And if some kids know it when they're young and growing up,  I don't know if it's best to not say it or to be open, but if they're open to their parents about it, then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then. 

Recording: (9577/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'll be starting in 2003. 

Recording: (9578/ 10721) 
 That's great. 

Recording: (9579/ 10721) 
 basic where they learn things is their peers they don't get everything instilled at home that's pretty much what you  know, I seen talking to my husband and, you know, and there's so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do  at all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they're ready. 

Recording: (9580/ 10721) 
 sure you do something with them. But this group, the middle 30s I called them, you had to misogyism. And that's what Clinton did so well. And that's what Dole could have done. I'm not sure if  George W. is going to be able to because to get the nomination eventually he's going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is I'm anti-abortion,  pro-gun, he's already said the pro-gun, and that's going against what most Americans are saying. Dole, I think, represented where most Americans 

Recording: (9581/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I've been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when I moved up to Delaware.  It's a real  comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just, you know, it gets worse and worse. 

Recording: (9582/ 10721) 
 They saw us have difficult times and they saw us, our spouses, crying together, forgiving one another, arguing with another just as much as you do.  you can have being in a human relationship. They saw that. They saw the love for one another. They saw overnight where I'd start caring for my dad because my mother died instantly.  like short term, an hour. And now he had a stroke. I didn't know whether, I saved other lives. And I had to learn all that. And 

Recording: (9583/ 10721) 
 I think my grandpa goes to church. 

Recording: (9584/ 10721) 
 We'll see. 

Recording: (9585/ 10721) 
 Honestly, it would be I'd probably base the decision basically political  I can't say I'd really hold that against him or anything. Obviously it's not something I'd be like, oh good, let's vote for him since he did that. 

Recording: (9586/ 10721) 
 Well, they needed to strike, don't get me wrong. That's not the stupid part. But the part was, the majority of them saying that they were here for 10 years and they ain't making that much money.  most people would move on. 

Recording: (9587/ 10721) 
 Right, wow. 

Recording: (9588/ 10721) 
 Yeah, like underground. Now it's gotten real big. Like it's still different too. There's still like a really big scene and there's still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (9589/ 10721) 
 She graduated last year, but she went home. She was on home study. 

Recording: (9590/ 10721) 
 And it only took less than two months. 

Recording: (9591/ 10721) 
 instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give a background on him and that's  It's what everyone bases their view on, it seems to be, is that everyone turns to the media to see what's going on when the media is only showing one side of the story. I mean, there's definitely much more out there.  there 

Recording: (9592/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9593/ 10721) 
 means than just giving them the number. We spent more time doing that. 

Recording: (9594/ 10721) 
 and you've been going to Ohio State that whole time. 

Recording: (9595/ 10721) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (9596/ 10721) 
 I said, yep. I said, you caught mommy saying a bad word and you got soap in your mouth? Yep. So I go in the bathroom. Now what I always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and I just pull  bit of soap on the end of her tongue. Well now I've been I've had false teeth since I was about 32. Needless to say I had false teeth when this kid did this. She's only about five years old. Go in the bathroom  I sit down on that toilet stool and I sit there, I stick out my tongue. She takes that cake of soap. She doesn't rub my tongue, she twists it. It got on my teeth and it took

 Mm-hmm Yeah, there's almost nobody anymore that's willing to do just miniscule things Unless you're going to be a pig  money, money, money, money, money, money, money. 

Recording: (9598/ 10721) 
 As he was speaking and as he started to speak, I realized too, another thing that I really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here, but how the politicians are, is because the world  in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and I think that's had a tremendous influence also on  our politics and on we as a people. 

Recording: (9599/ 10721) 
 go back and assist in teaching, but I think that many of the courses  Other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value, family values. I could even go so far as to say  chemistry or botany or psychology, any one of those, those are specialized subjects and 

Recording: (9600/ 10721) 
 Well, I was born on a homestead out in northern Montana, and then my parents moved back to Iowa, which was their home.  area, southern Iowa. I grew up there, attended high school there, then I went to Iowa State for  five quarters and I just didn't get it. And then I worked around home for a year. 

Recording: (9601/ 10721) 
 That's all I understand is money. 

Recording: (9602/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9603/ 10721) 
 I said, man, why are they pulled over like that? There must be something going on. He said, we ain't gonna worry about it right now. I'm gonna get back up there. 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  And I look over and there's this big old white swirling cloud comes down. It's about two miles west of us I'm coming just out of my  I'm out of my screws here, I'm just going. 

Recording: (9604/ 10721) 
 names. I actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she  She didn't know what, she had twins, and she didn't know what to name them, and she'd run out of names that she liked, so they brought her Munch in to her.  And the nurse jokingly said, or the aide or something, well just pick a couple names off the menu. So she named them Lamangelo. 

Recording: (9605/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9606/ 10721) 
 You know, technically there's insanity and there isn't insanity, but in my opinion, there is nobody who ever killed anybody who isn't insane. And just to  to knock them out is not appropriate. We need to try to save them.  not in the terms of a Christian saving, but to make them work that off and face it and come in their own mind. 

Recording: (9607/ 10721) 
 If they had a way to cure it, then fine, but leave that up to the people. 

Recording: (9608/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9609/ 10721) 
 But I do know my brother-in-law mentioned to his parents, gosh, what a sacrifice you guys did for us. And he's just turned 50.  And they don't have any kids. And he says, well, how you did it? Well, for one thing, they probably did a lot of sacrifice.  And when you sacrifice, it makes you more humble.

 There's a lot of, I don't know, how the training is done with some of these animals. Some of them are treated very cruelly.  boy. 

Recording: (9611/ 10721) 
 we do have a mutual thing and young people there you know there's so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know  off course and everything else and then it doesn't stay the same. I mean it's all exciting and all that and then I think it's kind of... 

Recording: (9612/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9613/ 10721) 
 I think it's better probably if they don't say anything about it, you know. And most of the people, you know, like when you get to, I lived in the barracks a lot of time, but I mean,  You know a lot of people you know they get their own places off base, you know Who cares what they I mean, I don't care, you know, like I said, I have a gay friend  that, you know, I don't care what they do. I mean, they're old enough to do whatever the heck they want to do, you know. 

Recording: (9614/ 10721) 
 I was married but I didn't have any kids. Once you have kids you're not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule. So I didn't take off any time.  When I got my master's I ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in Worthington and he said, oh, I'm the special ed director up there now, we need a resource  teacher. Why don't you come up and interview for this position? Or that position? Or... When I went up and interviewed for that position, got another position, but anyway, it all worked out. 

Recording: (9615/ 10721) 
 I'm not sure if I'm paying attention. 

Recording: (9616/ 10721) 
 the people who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from Columbus. 

Recording: (9617/ 10721) 
 Hi, I'm a perchable. 

Recording: (9618/ 10721) 
 I mean, he's kind of in big trouble. They're wanting to pull the charter on him and everything. But he's going to try and...  keep the school open, which is going to be ridiculous. 

Recording: (9619/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9620/ 10721) 
 It's an ego trip, that's all it is, basically. It's like, look, I can do this. 

Recording: (9621/ 10721) 
 It's over off of 33, 270 and 33. 

Recording: (9622/ 10721) 
 Well, and especially in my situation, you know, I think about it quite a bit, you know, if I would have had more of an opportunity to have a one-on-one.  relationship with her. I probably, being a girl, you know, could have probably helped her out and had a lot of social  social things, you know, about men. Because I kind of get the impression that she don't really, she still ain't very interested in men, you know, so. 

Recording: (9623/ 10721) 
 No, because like I work, like I said, my supervisor is a black woman. Now, I get along good with her. The other woman is an Indian woman. I get along  real good with her. The other guy's a black guy, I get along real good with her, but my supervisor's got a friend that's a black woman that works in another department. Now she'll come and talk to her and dump all  her work on to us. 

Recording: (9624/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9625/ 10721) 
 So I hesitate to say that it would really help them. It would just be better if somebody could keep their eyes open or if we had more counselors or things like that.  like that to deal with everything, including that. 

Recording: (9626/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9627/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9628/ 10721) 
 It was for me and a couple other people that was it

 They don't have any like endangered, they're not like on an endangered species list where you can't like. 

Recording: (9630/ 10721) 
 Well, among the people I know, I think it's a pretty tolerant city. I know a lot of people who live  down in Old Town, you know, in a very diverse environment. And, you know, I just don't  know any racists, I don't think. 

Recording: (9631/ 10721) 
 She goes, well yeah, Dad, they cost money. I said, oh, Lord. 

Recording: (9632/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9633/ 10721) 
 You know, he had...

 you 

Recording: (9635/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (9636/ 10721) 
 If there were any Germans in there, I'll bet they're scared. 

Recording: (9637/ 10721) 
 and, you know, like reading about things that happened to people, like their kids spitting up in their face or something. 

Recording: (9638/ 10721) 
 Yeah, pretty much. 

Recording: (9639/ 10721) 
 Well, my family is so funny because my parents are so, you would never put them together now, you know. Back then, you know, my,  You saw my mom. No, you didn't see her. She's cute. She's got a little haircut. She's all like... 

Recording: (9640/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I got a son, he's a senior at Audubon. 

Recording: (9641/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (9642/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9643/ 10721) 
 I think they're missing the point because I'm sure there's some runaway white teenage girls out there too or Mexican or whatnot. 

Recording: (9644/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9645/ 10721) 
 and also at the Show of Hands galleries. 

Recording: (9646/ 10721) 
 No, I'm not really up on the coaching thing. I mean, anybody can coach a game. It takes players to play the game. 

Recording: (9647/ 10721) 
 No, I really just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around. 

Recording: (9648/ 10721) 
 So when he was a junior, then he started in high school, he started really seriously thinking, I got to get it together. What am I going to do?  So he agreed to go to a psychiatrist and so he went on Ritalin. So he took the  Ritalin through his last of his junior year and his senior year. Now he's on a medication they call Welbutrin. 

Recording: (9649/ 10721) 
 other person is wrong and leave it at that. But that's not what you're thinking. You're thinking, you're looking at me and you're knowing within your mind, he's evil, he's wrong. And I said, that's not right, dude.  Why do you think there's so much of that non-acceptance in Christianity and other religions as well?  there are certain denominations that will take one, it's sort of like the outer limits. They'll take one book or one scripture out of the Bible and expand it to 

Recording: (9650/ 10721) 
 As far as affiliated with a party, I probably respond to Republicans more than Democrats, but  I think given any choice of any party at all, I'm probably more libertarian than anything else. 

Recording: (9651/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9652/ 10721) 
 Exactly right yeah, yeah, and you know a lot of people I work with don't see that and you know they think I'm a real cheapskate you know because you know I will I spend money You know it well. I I'm very selective  I mean like I'd love to go to Disney World and there are people at work that would not go to Disney World just because of what it costs to get in you know. Now I drive there, I don't fly because I'm really that cheap but  I'd love to fly, but I just go, oh my gosh. I will do that, but at Thanksgiving time, we don't buy a butter ball turkey. 

Recording: (9653/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (9654/ 10721) 
 I ended up running away from home. 

Recording: (9655/ 10721) 
 medication is like the difference between night and day. You go back in, observe the kid, you can't believe it's the same kid. Other kids, dead and face them, they might as well be drinking a glass of water. Well,  And since they have side effects, like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite, and some kids get headaches from dexedrine and Adderall.  So I say, you know, if it works, use it. If it doesn't work, just forget it. But, you know, a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because 

Recording: (9656/ 10721) 
 I felt I got better attention when I wanted it, you know, than I would have at a bigger school. 

Recording: (9657/ 10721) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (9658/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9659/ 10721) 
 because I become unpopular if I have like any time away from my girlfriend. 

Recording: (9660/ 10721) 
 warriors that are out there, men and women, that will do that. More power to them. All I can do is pray about it, and that's what I suggest to everybody else.  That's the most powerful thing that you can do. Even one of the nuns in high school that taught me had a poster on the wall that said, more things are wrought  in this world by prayer than we'll ever know. 

Recording: (9661/ 10721) 
 this little kid who still has a living parent. And I don't understand that at all. I mean that is just so, I think the government gets involved in totally, you know.  way out of line 

Recording: (9662/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9663/ 10721) 
 I know, I am. I can't wait because the house we live in, it's a half double when we had a front porch and a deck, which I really decked out, but you know.  I have like 80 plants in my house now, but I just can't wait to have my own space. I never plant anything in the ground there because I thought, well, I'm going to leave, you know. 

Recording: (9664/ 10721) 
 Now we run an online system where people connect to our system and build databases or access the databases.  Everything OSU has in their library collection is in our system. Their records came from us.  Yeah, well, yeah. And we do that for tens of thousands of libraries. 

Recording: (9665/ 10721) 
 being here at the university. 

Recording: (9666/ 10721) 
 But not all of them are that way. 

Recording: (9667/ 10721) 
 I think it should be my way. And I think the material should be there. I think it should be dealt with in a calm and reasonable way. And I think it should be accessible to the kids.  you 

Recording: (9668/ 10721) 
 Just a job. That's an awesome job. 

Recording: (9669/ 10721) 
 See, he's just in his twos and I like, he's gotta be in a cart or something. Well, cuz when I'm holding his hand and taking him.  He just tends to want to, he's not calm and collective. He's a little, you know.  So that's why we don't do nothing, because when I take them to people's houses, I can't do that, because they'll get into everything. I get real stressed out about that. 

Recording: (9670/ 10721) 
 Yes, private homes and actually where I work there's not a facility. 

Recording: (9671/ 10721) 
 So it's really weird because, uh... 

Recording: (9672/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9673/ 10721) 
 I'd say probably the black man. 

Recording: (9674/ 10721) 
 I've been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women. Sometimes I felt kind of weird about it. 

Recording: (9675/ 10721) 
 That's what you want. 

Recording: (9676/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's it. 

Recording: (9677/ 10721) 
 I don't say that of all of the kids because I know that some of them were brought up right. 

Recording: (9678/ 10721) 
 Right. And also, the other thing is you have to be compassionate because you're working a lot of airplanes and you're wanting answers like this. When you spit something out, you want  an answer. Each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign. If I tell somebody turn left heading 360, he's supposed to respond TWA 396, roger. If he doesn't respond,  then I've got to say it again, which means instead of 10 airplanes, I now have 11 I'm talking to, because I have to talk to him two times each. So there are some people that get really 

Recording: (9679/ 10721) 
 No. 

Recording: (9680/ 10721) 
 No, I mean it's nothing crazy, whatever they think they're gotten. 

Recording: (9681/ 10721) 
 If that happened, I would be 10 times more understanding and I would say, you know, I would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes. 

Recording: (9682/ 10721) 
 They don't do it today unless the person's a scholar. I mean, a 3.8 Rhodes Scholar, hey, okay. 

Recording: (9683/ 10721) 
 I'm 

Recording: (9684/ 10721) 
 Heh heh heh heh heh. 

Recording: (9685/ 10721) 
 Yes, but you know what, his parents are going to, you know, really going to let people know that 

Recording: (9686/ 10721) 
 and then they physically died before they got a chance to live. And when their spirit wakes up and finds out that they're physically dead and they can't  do anything in a physical world anymore. They want to draw themselves to, especially if they were a bad person, they want to draw them to  brightest thing. 

Recording: (9687/ 10721) 
 Once upon a time, there was a gentleman named **** and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot. 

Recording: (9688/ 10721) 
 Yeah. I don't really have any childhood recollections of California. Yeah. 

Recording: (9689/ 10721) 
 Mmm. Well that bathroom's starting to sound good right about now. 

Recording: (9690/ 10721) 
 got to help here to make the home. And I think that that's one of the problems. Too many people think instead of just getting them to lovingly help each other because we're supposed to help each other,  And this goes all right back to what I said you said beginning in school or kindergarten I think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a box  and rock it and sing to it put it to bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up teach him how to tie their shoes and take them off teach him how to do everything there's 

Recording: (9691/ 10721) 
 So yes, in my opinion, definitely it's eroding. I know you took a little different approach in answering the question from  over the time that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect.  I've always been the kind of person to leave. I never told my kids not to do something.  I  Can't do it this age. Somebody can at another age. Possibly like go out on a date, for example. Well, he's going out to a party like I have. Well, he's already 16 years old.  But I mean I never did.  Well, I won't give you any examples. But anyway, if I told them they couldn't do it, I would try them. Swearing is one of my bad habits. And I know that I would try to  I got taught one time that I better watch a little more carefully by my own little girl.  If they did catch me doing something that I'd be telling them, no, you cannot do, I would apologize and say, mommy was bad and mommy did that. I got sick of my mouth one time because of it.  Well, that's really admirable. Oh, no. I mean, if you want to hear the story, it's funny. Well, the TV just, I was baking pie, and I was taking this pie out of the oven. It was a cherry pie or an apple pie.  I said  I like to sit there for a minute before I take it out. I take it on out and sit on top of it. Well, mommy said a bad word.  I guess that mommy has to have soap in her mouth, doesn't she? I get to put soap in your mouth? I said, yep. I said, yep.  You caught mommy saying a bad word? 

Recording: (9692/ 10721) 
 Because now they're getting to the age where they're fighting more and you got a boy and a girl. 

Recording: (9693/ 10721) 
 before I got there. So I was in all these courses. I was the only American. The classes were really small. And it was, you know, I definitely got a feeling. And there were a few  classes that really stood out were, you know, there was sort of, you know, I'd have to say something or I'd have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like, what does this American  can know and that was the hardest thing, the way I was treated by some of my peers in classes. 

Recording: (9694/ 10721) 
 Even Republicans were like that. 

Recording: (9695/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9696/ 10721) 
 It's been completely outrageous storylines and the jokes aren't as integrated into  the story. 

Recording: (9697/ 10721) 
 Just get me a couple shirts or something. You know, she always bought my clothes anyway, so just get me a couple, get me whatever you think I need, you know. I'll be here drinking beer, watching sports.  and the courts.

Recording: (9699/ 10721) 
 I was also robbed about three times delivering pizzas for Domino's in the campus area.  A couple of times we're down a little bit south of campus, 4th Street and 5th Avenue near there, 4th Street and 7th.  once was right on, practically on campus, 16th Avenue near High Street. I was robbed there once. Yeah, near 

Recording: (9700/ 10721) 
 And I tell people at the VA clinic and everything, they got a homeless thing over there. And I said, you know, this guy, Brenda, I know, he's a Vietnam vet.  You guys need to get out there and help him, you know? I mean, you're in more of a situation than I am to be able to go out and sit there and...  He wants to be taken like Mary Haven or something like that And he's been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out 

Recording: (9701/ 10721) 
 That goes a lot longer than just giving them that. Because if they give it, they don't do with it. So I really think...  As I always say, traveling, people are all the same worldwide. They just give them different colors, different facial, different accents.  so God can give them unique characteristics so he can call them his own. He knows each one of us. But we're all the same when we sit down 

Recording: (9702/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9703/ 10721) 
 And they fought a lot. There was a lot of violence. And then I love Walt Disney. I mean, all that stuff. They have beautiful music. But I swear I haven't seen a  Walt Disney movie that doesn't have violence in it. 

Recording: (9704/ 10721) 
 They were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one dose. And they were giving him three doses.

 Right. 

Recording: (9707/ 10721) 
 I see no. 

Recording: (9708/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9709/ 10721) 
 The drivers aren't so insane like they are here. People are a little bit more laid back just because like, I don't know, in parts it is really insane, but sometimes people  just like because it's all because it's nice weather people don't get so like aggravated by like here it's like cold and gray and you just want to like yell at people in their  car and stuff or something I don't know. I don't know what people's deal is. 

Recording: (9710/ 10721) 
 Ah, wow. 

Recording: (9711/ 10721) 
 You know, it's like, look, you always think I could, you know, look, I'm doing really well. Look how wonderful everything is. 

Recording: (9712/ 10721) 
 Oh, sure. 

Recording: (9713/ 10721) 
 Well I believe it's quality not quantity. Ideally, one parent would be there, be it male or female, you know, man or wife.  everywhere, but your quality time is more important. If you come home and you're not  All you want to do is sit down and start watching TV or drinking beer or whatever, you know, and not spend any time with your child.

 Yeah.

Recording: (9718/ 10721) 
 Shouldn't you have a little more knowledge, a little more support around you? Educating, knowing, self-discipline?  And what's really crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children don't know the dads.

 I think that's too young to talk about birth control methods and everything, but with AIDS and as rampant as it is now, and there's so many more women that have it, start off it was mostly men.  Women have got to know at an early age about these different diseases and things.

 So.

 But in the winters when you know, I mean, I don't exercise that much. 

Recording: (9740/ 10721) 
 So, you know, I just think the more you're open about things, I just think that's the best. Why, you know, when you put things and don't talk about it, that's  That's when the problems start. 

Recording: (9741/ 10721) 
 What would you go with?

 Very, very much so. Now, 50 years ago, 25 to 50 years ago, we would tag that description rather than corporation, we would tag that  that as socialism.

Yeah, we're still democratic according to our new definition it is.

 I think that, I don't think that divorce is a bad thing. I think that if you're married and you realize  that you get to a point where you and this other person are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family, that it's better to just say,  This is not working. We both deserve to be happy and go your own separate ways. 

Recording: (9781/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (9782/ 10721) 
 Yes, mm-hmm. Yeah, I do miss that, but at the same time, I've, you know, I had a lot of opportunity to be there.  to do those things. There are cultural things to do in Columbus and it does  sort of make me mad when people are like, oh Columbus, there's nothing to do there. I find myself defending Columbus a lot more now than

Recording: (9784/ 10721) 
 not really. I was too proud. I think my dad paid my first month's rent for me though. I paid him back and then I never  I never wanted to borrow any money. I guess just growing up, the youngest of five, I appreciated money. 

Recording: (9785/ 10721) 
 I guess so. I hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids and but it won't be him running  it 

Recording: (9786/ 10721) 
 you know, compared to any other cities. Of course, I'm, I left Oregon, I was very rural for 18 years. 

Recording: (9787/ 10721) 
 They're all at daycare. They just aren't around anymore. It's not the same anymore where every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff.  You know, they've made a lot of friends through there and they still, the daughter who's in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the daycare.  cares. 

Recording: (9788/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9789/ 10721) 
 I mean, we went in there one day and I explained the whole thing to her. And then she puts off some kind of excuse to the administrator. She says, well,  We don't need problem students like yourself, blah, blah, blah. I said, what problem? 

Recording: (9790/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (9791/ 10721) 
 And so, you know, even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown, it's not it's not because I have to. It's not because he you know, he wouldn't do something that.  that something else, this suits me fine. 

Recording: (9792/ 10721) 
 I mean, they went to the polls in droves. You didn't have to, you know, the hope there was that they wouldn't go to vote on the school levy. But actually trying to get college kids involved.  I haven't really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself. It might be a little pocket of a campaign, but nothing big. 

Recording: (9793/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm because I want his morals and you know his basic stuff to come from me really 

Recording: (9794/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I would say anything outside. I like doing that. 

Recording: (9795/ 10721) 
 You had a harvest, didn't you? 

Recording: (9796/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (9797/ 10721) 
 He'll basically tell you he don't have no father except for me. 

Recording: (9798/ 10721) 
 I do it, so. 

Recording: (9799/ 10721) 
 Yeah, avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do. Better decisions that help. 

Recording: (9800/ 10721) 
 Well, that depends. I think I like to do new stuff, but sometimes I also like to do the old favorites.  In the symphony, unfortunately, they tend to have budget problems.  Because a lot of the people in that group are paid. I get paid kind of a semi-professional aspect. 

Recording: (9801/ 10721) 
 and partying sound pretty good, so. 

Recording: (9802/ 10721) 
 and you register them and then you just keep after them. You keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign. In Ohio I think it's easier to do that because there is a law that  I don't think it's in primaries, but in general elections at 11 o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, they have to list those who have voted. They have to put up a list  of registered voters and cross out those who have voted. So what I used to do is I took my list that I had gotten from the Board of Elections earlier and compared it with my list of 

Recording: (9803/ 10721) 
 Um, yeah. I mean, I've got girls that are... that have girlfriends and stuff. And it doesn't bother me. I mean...  I'm not, I like men and I'm a Christian and I just believe that you know you should be,  God didn't put two women on this earth. God didn't put two men. They put a man and a woman to be together, to have kids.

 Yeah, it's gone downhill a lot.

 Right. 

Recording: (9811/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9812/ 10721) 
 And much and much other things, you know that I'm coming to understand 

Recording: (9813/ 10721) 
 Ah, probably. 

Recording: (9814/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9815/ 10721) 
 Oh.

 I talk to all my family, my brothers and sisters every day.

 Mwahaha 

Recording: (9821/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9822/ 10721) 
 Some really wacky stuff. 

Recording: (9823/ 10721) 
 I don't want either of these people. 

Recording: (9824/ 10721) 
 But the dispatch, the only reason I get the dispatch is I do want to know what's going on locally. 

Recording: (9825/ 10721) 
 Answered an ad in the paper, but I've sung in, well, Sean sings in the symphony chorus too. I've sung in it for 16 years.

 Too much?

 My older sister is a different case. She's a little badder. But as long as you have a good parent, I think that's really all that matters.  was my mother and father. She did very well. 

Recording: (9831/ 10721) 
 I don't know how to get to it like the way we walk, but I don't know what street it's on. 

Recording: (9832/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'd do that. 

Recording: (9833/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, it might be. 

Recording: (9834/ 10721) 
你呀 

Recording: (9835/ 10721) 
 That was kinda neat though. 

Recording: (9836/ 10721) 
 So she so I probably did learn a little bit because I she's still that she's lives with a man now and he does all the cooking still so I've  I learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that, which I did love to cook. 

Recording: (9837/ 10721) 
 I think that the 

Recording: (9838/ 10721) 
 the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that. They come here and if they can't make it, then they'll just bomb somewhere. But I see a lot of  A lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things. You kind of want to do a study of how long they've been here. It would be interesting.  Oh I think there's got to be a line drawn and I think that you know if they're caught 

Recording: (9839/ 10721) 
 So I'm sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for. 

Recording: (9840/ 10721) 
 It's amazing. And that's something I know my husband, we always joke about, he tells his guys at work, you know, like, you know, to take flowers for no reason, you know, like  Like one guy was saying something about his anniversary and Peter said, well, are you going to take flowers? And he goes, oh, I don't know. And he said, trust me, take some flowers. 

Recording: (9841/ 10721) 
 I think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and I think that's a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years.  So it's been an adjustment for him, but he loves his baby brother. It's really, he nurtures him too, so.  That's neat to watch. 

Recording: (9842/ 10721) 
 Now we're busy. 

Recording: (9843/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9844/ 10721) 
 and anything you don't know you leave blank and I'll just grade what you put down. 

Recording: (9845/ 10721) 
 no commitment. If these guys have commitment and you see guys out there, they want to go further possibly in their careers and professionals. Others want to  Maybe fulfill something, whatever it is. You ask each individual what it is that drives you. And that's the thing, I get so perturbed by interviewers. They ask somebody and  And somebody comes back and says, you know what I mean? Yeah. Get inside the guy's mind. What did he mean? 

Recording: (9846/ 10721) 
 Well, they're supposed to do more too, but by the time they get to fourth grade, they're so busy trying to be the class clown, they decide it's a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to fill your mind with knowledge.  you 

Recording: (9847/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (9848/ 10721) 
 She just used the word penalty. Penalty has lots of different definitions. Each individual has a mental picture of what  the word penalty means based upon their own experiences. I want to take just and say penalty in a very general sort  of way, whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left. Let's come back to about the middle. I'm going 

Recording: (9849/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9850/ 10721) 
 Okay, I... 

Recording: (9851/ 10721) 
 I still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing There's a God believing that you should take the other person into consideration. It might sound very basic, but it's very the whole  very hard thing to accomplish, especially when they've gotten into this, like you said, me, me, me, and I got to have this and that status symbol stuff. And really, if we older people  people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because I know I myself

 I hear some of that from Gor, but not as much.

 understood what I was saying, but I felt led to talk to them. And that's what I believe my faith is. My faith is faith. It's believing that  things happen that you can't explain. It's believing that you're doing what you're doing is right.  Religion's a real big part of my life.

 Yeah, he was lucky. So. 

Recording: (9856/ 10721) 
 It's a clinical study where we're seeing how treadmill training affects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury. 

Recording: (9857/ 10721) 
 I think so. I think so. It's so sad to see a girl, you know,  have so many options closed off. I don't mean it by any stretch that it's a tragedy to have a baby, but somebody in high school  is making a lot of decisions she doesn't intend to make. 

Recording: (9858/ 10721) 
 definite ideas about it, partner everything. 

Recording: (9859/ 10721) 
 You're here for a reason. And you're here in the United States for a reason. Of all the Beatitudes you have here, don't you think it's time to share some of those?  the things, the talent, and to not necessarily be recognized for those things, but some personalities require personalities, it's the way it is.  To do things without expecting something in return. That would be so nice to see that written on magazine fronts. 

Recording: (9860/ 10721) 
 You know, because when you're overseas, it's a different environment. 

Recording: (9861/ 10721) 
 Oh, I take the little ladies. I take the church. 

Recording: (9862/ 10721) 
 Even though I knew better at the point when I was faced with that at 17 or whatever, I wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that I  You know what I mean? And I knew better, but you just, you know. And it's like, well, I wasn't that strong granted, but I was probably the normal teen, and I think most of the people  I knew at that age were lost at much younger than 17. You know, ugh. Okay, 11, 12, it's like, 

Recording: (9863/ 10721) 
 there's so many millions of guns in the world that you're wondering where are they all coming from. I think laws can help, especially  with children and they have these new guns that not just a safety lock but you know it's like identification thing.

 My mother's go in, get what you want, get the heck out.

 No, I thought my son.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (9867/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (9868/ 10721) 
 I should have some other thing to exchange for money. I would much rather exchange ideas for money, or previously done work for money, or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money. I'm in favor of that.  put a good system by which to do things, I sell it to you, you go do those things, I sit around and make money off of your efforts. Yay, that. So. 

Recording: (9869/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (9870/ 10721) 
 You can see it here, you can see some nineteen year old or eighteen year old guy.  or girl or whatever, you know, and see the difference in the maturity, you know, of another couple or three different people and everything. I don't know whether  Me coming from like a rural area, you know, I asked and everything I Think it maybe has something to do with that even to today, you know, you're more of

 Uh huh. 

Recording: (9872/ 10721) 
 In my own civilian terms, I said, why would you want to give up an original? Why would you want to give up an original and have a copy? Because all these others, one  to be. Well, in other words, you follow Christianity. 

Recording: (9873/ 10721) 
 I went to... It's the new high school there. 

Recording: (9874/ 10721) 
 The same thing, I think they're terrific for the right things. 

Recording: (9875/ 10721) 
 I'm gonna let him choose. I really am. I think as long I mean, I really don't care what religion he is. I mean with my husband, I really didn't care if he turned Catholic or not.  not. I do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and that he has a place to go to pray to be with his family.  and other people, I think that's important. If he wants to be Catholic, great. If he doesn't, that's okay. 

Recording: (9876/ 10721) 
 As much, probably. 

Recording: (9877/ 10721) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (9878/ 10721) 
 And then, but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house, and he came out crying. I mean, it was on TV. It was like heart-wrenching. 

Recording: (9879/ 10721) 
 et 

Recording: (9880/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9881/ 10721) 
 Well, 

Recording: (9882/ 10721) 
 The second thing would be the cultural activities that we have.  Wexner Center would be one of my primary ones because there's so much going on down there, but the art museum and, oh right, that Cultural Arts Center.  and Columbus Music Hall. I mean, there's just a million things. 

Recording: (9883/ 10721) 
 So, to me, the thing that hurt me the most out of it is they want to put caps on our salaries. So I'm at the high end.  scale I can go right now as far as job title. There's no other job I can move to unless I move into supervision or something up in the... and I'll be out of the  the union if I do that anyway. But they're going to put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point, which I'm almost there right now. 

Recording: (9884/ 10721) 
 It's good money, yeah. One idea that I just had recently is medical informaticist, which is a person who has an MD and does computers.  Since those are my two main interests, I thought doing both would be really cool.

 and he was the assistant manager of a video game store I worked at in high school.

 Wow.

Recording: (9893/ 10721) 
 And then, after so long a time, after I don't know how long, again, the powers that be said,  We'll fool them, we'll fog up that whole area with smoke. 

Recording: (9894/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9895/ 10721) 
 They definitely struggle. I think to be that high up, obviously you're going to come in contact with powerful people, rich people, and things like that.  I think at least even if the Democrats do have that same thing, they seem to keep more in mind the... I don't think they represent working class  you know, guy either, but at least more so than the Republicans. So like I said, best out of a bad bunch, I'd probably. 

Recording: (9896/ 10721)

 unless you get stuck in traffic. 

Recording: (9899/ 10721) 
 stuff and every day there was a new twist on this story that or they announced the news was that there wasn't a news twist.  Yeah, I don't care. But you couldn't turn it off because that's all that was on.

Recording: (9901/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9902/ 10721) 
 And at least it gave you a lot of different views. 

Recording: (9903/ 10721) 
 You know, and it's just, I think that that happens so often. There's so many people, or even that whole thing with Bill Clinton, when you're talking circles around yourself, but you never say anything. 

Recording: (9904/ 10721) 
 being turned away. 

Recording: (9905/ 10721) 
 I'm not real big on the denominations because I think that sort of goes against what the original intent of Christianity was.  I mean, it was designed to be a unifying religion and the denominations are just... I don't like them. 

Recording: (9906/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but my oldest, she's the oldest. She's got three kids. Her oldest is by a different guy, and her new husband adopted her because she never sees them.  them. And then they got two other girls. And they live together, got a house, you know, they're on, they're going through marriage. They've been together for like  five years and they're not going they're not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they'll get over that and then I got a older

 At this point, I'm not against the urban schools, but if it was my own personal child, I would merge.  move to a suburban area until Columbus gets their act together. They are in such bad shape right now that I do think the state will take over the Columbus Public  schools in two years. Yeah. They've threatened it. And if they don't pull their scores up they will. You know. 

Recording: (9908/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and she's adorable.

 at  You can see its face, you can see what it looks like and everything, but I said, I don't want to know the sex. And it's so hard to, because we're looking, of course we're going through this tape trying to see if we can see anything.  can't tell. I think she was real careful to make sure that we wouldn't be able to. She says, I know what it is, but I said, alright, don't tell us. So that 

Recording: (9910/ 10721) 
 And 

Recording: (9911/ 10721) 
 they would hire me to teach this class. They gave me a book that was about this thick and it was only about painting. 

Recording: (9912/ 10721) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (9913/ 10721) 
 I know. 

Recording: (9914/ 10721) 
 I do that every once in a while, just like when I get bored. 

Recording: (9915/ 10721) 
 And they actually offered an early retirement because the funds, you may not remember, about three years ago, four years ago, the federal government was not going to pass a budget.  So when that doesn't happen on budget and cuts in at 75% of what the previous year budget was or something like that Which was actually more money than they were going to give us before the head  it. So they had to lay off people or offer retirement. So I took the retirement. Because 

Recording: (9916/ 10721) 
 Or then they had to, after that, they had to lottery number and that wasn't, if you were hot, you know, if you got, your number was picked, I mean, I don't know what should be worse, knowing that you're going to get a notice and being able to  to prepare for it or because I've had friends that got numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god. 

Recording: (9917/ 10721) 
 I've got nothing against Christianity, but I got something against the way it was brought here. 

Recording: (9918/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9919/ 10721) 
 uh... i don't i mean they're definitely is that image of you know dallas and i see i think it's it's worse i think  the image of the tourists. Basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded. That was sort of another thing when  you know, I went to school there is, you know, I had a scholarship. That's how I went there, you know, and I worked the 

Recording: (9920/ 10721) 
 I don't really remember October if that... 

Recording: (9921/ 10721) 
 Kind of yeah, actually with this case I do know what happened to the father, he ended up moving to Colorado. 

Recording: (9922/ 10721) 
 Well, no, actually my mom didn't. She was a very bad cook. 

Recording: (9923/ 10721) 
 Well, one thing, you know, being, I came from basically a poor neighborhood, poor lifestyle, early life and everything, you know, so.  If anything, I guess it kind of made me negative towards people that had influence and had money and didn't do anything good with.  that I'm a firm believer that if you've got something that you should share it with other people. I don't always practice what I preach, but that'd be a great way to do it. 

Recording: (9924/ 10721) 
 Right!

 Pretty well.

 Especially when we try to sleep at five in the morning. 

Recording: (9929/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9930/ 10721) 
 and they would ask, you know, can I do this, can I use this. Kids now, if I take my phone off and lay it on my desk, kids will walk right up and just take it. They won't ask me, they'll just go, oh. And then they start playing.  pushing button. Is this your phone? If I were at your house and I went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you wouldn't like it much would you? 

Recording: (9931/ 10721) 
 You can't explain that. And those have been questions I've been asked by our children. Well, how did your mom die? Well, gee, how do you know? Well, hey, that's one of the risks in life, marriage.  But the thing is, do you want to make it work? 

Recording: (9932/ 10721) 
 See, that's great though. 

Recording: (9933/ 10721) 
 I was born in New York.

 I don't have to put up with anyone's crap, but long drive and long distances is not good for me. Focusing, concentrating.  I've had several accidents, several tickets, I've even had  to other head injuries. 

Recording: (9935/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9936/ 10721) 
 Yeah, oh yeah. And I always use it as a decoration on the bed. But I think that that is a lot of the main problem.  Really. 

Recording: (9937/ 10721) 
 I think it has changed drastically and I think it is changing and I think it will also be changing in the future. Going all the way back  finances were not a consideration in the, oh I'd say probably my first 30, maybe 40 years, there was some.  influence, but I think the influence was not financial. It was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (9938/ 10721) 
 And then we'd go do what we wanted to do. 

Recording: (9939/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9940/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9941/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (9942/ 10721) 
 And she said, well, Mary just as well go out and get a job. She doesn't need to sit around here. 

Recording: (9943/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9944/ 10721) 
 Really. 

Recording: (9945/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9946/ 10721) 
 I can't see a lot of substance. He seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then turn it back.  It's not anything really firm. I mean with McCain and Bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was the points they wanted to make.  And I don't hear that coming from Bush. 

Recording: (9947/ 10721) 
 I've lived in Columbus my entire life, 34 years, born and raised on the west side of Columbus. 

Recording: (9948/ 10721) 
 I mean, I don't know.  Like I've never gotten the kind of dance clothes you're describing.  I mean, they weren't around. 

Recording: (9949/ 10721) 
 He was lucky. 

Recording: (9950/ 10721) 
 Yeah, but it's not a good way for me to make money. Because if you're farming out people, or if you're, better still, drop it down a level, if you are exchanging hours,  for money or time for money then you have a finite amount of time and that sucks. 

Recording: (9951/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9952/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (9953/ 10721) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (9954/ 10721) 
 but 

Recording: (9955/ 10721) 
 I do because they weren't in their children's lives enough. They weren't talking about things, being open about things, at dinner, finding out about school.  You can't blame them for having a site on the internet. Not too many parents would know that, that their kids, you know. But no, I think that's a good thing.  I put the blame on the parents. 

Recording: (9956/ 10721) 
 And I guess he's still going to build it. 

Recording: (9957/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I hear. 

Recording: (9958/ 10721) 
 That's, yeah, it's developmental. Because by the, did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that's when some expert thought  thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant. But now they found out that the full dominance doesn't take over until about age eight. 

Recording: (9959/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (9960/ 10721) 
 Not really, but I think living in the Bible Belt as she did. She was living there 10 years before she married and got involved in a youth group.  I think that was very influential on her decision. She was not married in the church, all my other children were.  She is going her own path and that's fine with me. She's a very good girl. She's very conscientious. 

Recording: (9961/ 10721) 
 See now. 

Recording: (9962/ 10721) 
 it's just out of your control. And I mean, like I said, I mean, that's sort of kids for you. I mean, they just, obviously they're going to be curious about things. And the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it.  but I don't know to what degree that they should go with it. 

Recording: (9963/ 10721) 
 It was part of that I started wrestling because a lot of my friends did. 

Recording: (9964/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's really a tough one because I think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer.  I don't think it's violence on TV. I don't think it's working parents. I think it's, I don't know what it is. It seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved.  easily. I don't know it's a tough one. I mean your daughter, his 

Recording: (9965/ 10721) 
 Oh, the Japanese come too. 

Recording: (9966/ 10721) 
 Why would you want to leave? You said you were in third world country. Why would you want to leave a third world country? I've been, I wouldn't want to, this country has a lot of problems. It's just like, my family has a lot of problems. Why would I want to leave a family?  family, why would I leave the country? Why not work with it and correct it? Because when I run away from it, you know what I'm doing? I'm running into another chaos at the other end. Someone else is coming in the other direction and they haven't resolved things.  And that's been happening in our society. We haven't sat down to learn and understand one another.  other churches. I'm thinking of an example, United Church of Christ, some parishes or  MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다. 

Recording: (9967/ 10721) 
 We sat there then for—oh, it was kind of funny.  the lieutenant who was a forward observer, were going out to a forward observation post.  Lieutenant, whatever his title was, was guiding. He was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him. And, of course, we just had these little 

Recording: (9968/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (9969/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (9970/ 10721) 
 like  um, just the suburbs develop and how it's more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that's really big. Like Columbus downtown,  is really ought to everything there's nothing to do down there it's all businesses and like the couple shops in a down there close at like six and there's like 

Recording: (9971/ 10721) 
 Yeah, now. 

Recording: (9972/ 10721) 
 I mean he was a funny guy, he was a really nice guy, but it took him a while to catch on to things. 

Recording: (9973/ 10721) 
 Oh sure, you can't get a grip. Really?  Just feel it's like  just tell you how to write it. Okay, well at least you're honest about it, you know?  But I went to like, I went out to the area of Dijon. 

Recording: (9974/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there's you know our shop only has about five people out of 20 maybe that have been here over 10 years probably a lot of turnover a lot of people  go on to management positions or leave. But once you've got 20 years in, it's like you can't leave now. 

Recording: (9975/ 10721) 
 There's lots of theater. And the third thing would be, we got restaurants. 

Recording: (9976/ 10721) 
 me out. 

Recording: (9977/ 10721) 
 Very new age. 

Recording: (9978/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (9979/ 10721) 
 You know what I mean? 

Recording: (9980/ 10721) 
 I think if you're open enough with your children, these parents, and say, you know, we want to give you this option, we prefer you don't do this.  But if you decide to do it, we want you to be protected. 

Recording: (9981/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9982/ 10721) 
 Really? 

Recording: (9983/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9984/ 10721) 
 I don't know. 

Recording: (9985/ 10721) 
 I do. I'll tell you, I've seen every name. After 28 years of 

Recording: (9986/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I was only 19. Well, I was 18 when I went in, but... 

Recording: (9987/ 10721) 
 Ha ha! 

Recording: (9988/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (9989/ 10721) 
 The Columbus race showed that. He crossed gender lines, he crossed party lines, he crossed over into all of the city.  winning even Dorothy Teeter's precinct, which surprised me. And not by just a little small margin, I think it was 200 and some votes, which is pretty substantial. 

Recording: (9990/ 10721) 
 and not the, you know, all that went on, you know, in New York, the fast pace. 

Recording: (9991/ 10721) 
 that with the cost and is it the cost or is it the wants? It's a very material society right now but it's also a very  a good time.  and

 a different file structure format than Windows 98. It runs on NTSF and FAT32 and I  have to switch it back to FAT16, and I can't get the partitioning right for my drive, because FAT16 can't handle anything above 2 gigs for  the primary drive and my drive is a 10 gig drive so I have to partition it and I can't figure out how to get silly thing partitioned. Every time I try and work around 

Recording: (9993/ 10721) 
 but it takes away that big trip. We've been and then his brother got married in Hawaii. So we went out there. So we've just done the honeymoon. It just  Disney World, Albuquerque a couple times, and Hawaii. But we have plans to go to Europe. He wants to go to England and things like that. We're looking  into Greece. 

Recording: (9994/ 10721) 
 That's why I started at the 

Recording: (9995/ 10721) 
 I mean, we had goals, certain things that, like we had a set where we'd like to do four hours of service every week. 

Recording: (9996/ 10721) 
 you know I mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never want to you know ever say anything but yeah that 

Recording: (9997/ 10721) 
 Heh. 

Recording: (9998/ 10721) 
 So to that end, we have a designated Friday evening date night. Sherry usually tries to get all of Saturday and all of Sunday as date night as well. So we're like an extended weekend thing. 

Recording: (9999/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, it's huge. 

Recording: (10000/ 10721) 
 So it's pretty much regular, like just a Western wedding where they throw the rice. 

Recording: (10001/ 10721) 
 See ya. 

Recording: (10002/ 10721) 
 one of those. 

Recording: (10003/ 10721) 
 You know, and when I came back here, I had moved to Kentucky. I came back here, I'd say 1973.

 I think, yes, especially this season. 

Recording: (10007/ 10721) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (10008/ 10721) 
 Right. Yeah, and my daughter doesn't seem to. 

Recording: (10009/ 10721) 
 They're normal people just outside of their sexual, well, majority of the people prefer heterosexual. 

Recording: (10010/ 10721) 
 I'm like, I don't remember that. 

Recording: (10011/ 10721) 
 And I don't like sitting in an office. 

Recording: (10012/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (10013/ 10721) 
 She, there's our wanderlust right there. She travels all the time.

 Those are, as I think you were implying, those are needs to those people, but they aren't. So how do we  We've got to slowly bring the family back home.  home. And I don't necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man, who cares? In today's work of

I live in Germany.  village. I like it here. Grew up here. Like it here. 

Recording: (10020/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10021/ 10721) 
 Which one of my kids, which one of my grandchildren are going to keep this or shall I have an auction and spend the money and travel? You see what I mean? You change. Your opinions change as you get older.  And you begin to look back. I don't think I was ever a spin thrift to the point that I did things foolishly. Some things I did do foolish, but  on an overall basis. 

Recording: (10022/ 10721) 
 See there, I think there has to be a quality to life too. 

Recording: (10023/ 10721) 
 Alright. 

Recording: (10024/ 10721) 
 and civil.

 to help him. 

Recording: (10026/ 10721) 
 I start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then she can take the boy over to the daycare and then they're only there five hours  or so. 

Recording: (10027/ 10721) 
 She's always trying to recruit people to come and visit her. But it's like a two hour drive and then everybody's busy. That's four hours of driving.  I don't know, it's just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way. 

Recording: (10028/ 10721) 
 I was at Eugene and I wasn't even in Eugene. It was a hundred thousand, you know, and I loved that but then I came back.  and I live in Olentangy Village, which is right on the river. And it's very, very scenic, very beautiful. 

Recording: (10029/ 10721) 
 That whole thing. 

Recording: (10030/ 10721) 
 South Pacific. 

Recording: (10031/ 10721) 
 Nothing's coming to mind now. 

Recording: (10032/ 10721) 
 I was the only straight person in there.  walk in there, she'd come right to me, no offense. 

Recording: (10033/ 10721) 
 There's a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they're miserable. 

Recording: (10034/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's a, you can, if you're, if you can't go to a girl's dorm until I think maybe the afternoon, I think maybe 11, I'm not sure.  But you have to be out by a certain time It's not as bad as like Malone. Like I don't know if you've heard about Malone. They have like certain days So it's not like that, but it's still just a pain  and 

Recording: (10035/ 10721) 
 We have a... yeah, we have. 

Recording: (10036/ 10721) 
 You're right. 

Recording: (10037/ 10721) 
 So like there's not a lot you can really do with that. 

Recording: (10038/ 10721) 
 I think the latter I don't think will make any difference. The kids that I know in junior high and in college, it just doesn't make any difference to them and they don't  like those classes. They think they're boring. They think it has no relevance to their life. 

Recording: (10039/ 10721) 
 Exactly. I wish I would have taken typing in home ec in high school and I was too busy with college prep and You know, what good did that do me? Yeah  Yeah, there's just... 

Recording: (10040/ 10721) 
 I'm going out there like this in a freaking retards I swear. But there's kids out there always cutting. 

Recording: (10041/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (10042/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10043/ 10721) 
 and putting together a network itself. And we had, you think of a party line system, or they used to call it daisy chain in the industry. You had to wait and wait  for your turn to get onto a data network. And we got down to the point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had a dedicated pipe.  you 

Recording: (10044/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10045/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10046/ 10721) 
 And so they went up there, but the Germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot. And that area of Enzio was just flat as this rock.  stable almost for an area back from the Mediterranean, back probably ten miles, ten or twelve miles  Well, along the coast, along. And so we had enough area to many people. 

Recording: (10047/ 10721) 
 know because I'm sure there are gay boys that are not knowing what's going on with themselves that are in school and  And I've never really understood, I never really understood if they were born like that or, I just never really understood that, to tell you the truth.  I wouldn't, you know, I would just, if I was a teacher, I would just talk to them and, you know, tell them to do whatever they want. 

Recording: (10048/ 10721) 
 Columbus mm-hmm. I went to I ended up in an alternative school system all along. I was I got into the lottery they used I  I made it into every school I applied for. 

Recording: (10049/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10050/ 10721) 
 No, she still lives down here. My other sister has two, niece and my nephew. 

Recording: (10051/ 10721) 
 So that was fun. Yeah. 

Recording: (10052/ 10721) 
 It's not the exact same as say class was in the Marxist sense. But class lines still today very much follow race lines.  And what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not  not going to be able to get a job that's going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort. I mean, in real terms, in things I think are 

Recording: (10053/ 10721) 
 difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (10054/ 10721) 
 You had it! 

Recording: (10055/ 10721) 
 High school, marijuana, acid, mushrooms. 

Recording: (10056/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (10057/ 10721) 
 I finally decided, well, we'll find something and I'll buy it and I'll be your landlady. And then it'll be nice. And so I bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to, was thinking she was going to move  that when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so I just rented that one. But the bottom line is I just got a second mortgage and I have a guy that I work with that helped me buy those without any money.  I didn't have a down payment. I had nothing. So it's like I can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment. 

Recording: (10058/ 10721) 
 The area I live in now is the Westgate area. We grew up on the Hilltop area, but I now live in the Westgate, which is a little further west. 

Recording: (10059/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10060/ 10721) 
 stuff at Christmas but it isn't so much you know and and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around I mean there there isn't that at  at all, at least in my experience there. And I can't imagine, because Western Europe I think is sort of as much like  America as you can get probably, you know, most places elsewhere in the world. And I mean, that would have been a fantastic experience.  you 

Recording: (10061/ 10721) 
 It's not going to work. 

Recording: (10062/ 10721) 
 It was just like that, I'm telling you it was. And we would see, you know, they would put things on the screen for us to watch. I mean, I learned a lot of stuff.  a very good experience I went through. Very good. 

Recording: (10063/ 10721) 
マスク 

Recording: (10064/ 10721) 
 I'm sorry, I can't. 

Recording: (10065/ 10721) 
 because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days. So they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (10066/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (10067/ 10721) 
 It is unifying, and I just wish, but I guess there's a rule out there, I've asked ABC News why they can't promote the,  these, you know, they show the roster, here's your grade point average, engineering, major, fine. Tell them what the majors are, tell them what these kids are, what they plan on doing.  They're not all going to make it to the professionals. Then what do they do afterwards? They get token jobs because of their connections? 

Recording: (10068/ 10721) 
 But they wouldn't, because my daughter was like a real bubbly, outgoing people person. And she got by with so much at school.  But she's, you know, it's worked out fine with her. With both of them, actually. 

Recording: (10069/ 10721) 
 because they feel they have the need for it. There's so many golfers. I mean, sports went sky high. My mom used to play golf growing up and they only let the  on the golf courses one day a week, which is amazing. It was like on a Tuesday. And when I lived in Florida, a lot of the courses were like that too. And I thought, they're only allowing women one day a week?  You know, isn't that amazing? There's so many good women golfers now, but they said they're too slow and they always talk and that just killed me when my mom, that's the only day she's ever been in a wheelchair. 

Recording: (10070/ 10721) 
 Actually, you can have, well they usually go together. Some kids have learning disabilities without the ADHD and some have ADHD without the learning disability and some have  both. You can have ADD without having the hyperactive part. You can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hypoactive  activity. And that's the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they're kind of like out of touch with reality and they're 

Recording: (10071/ 10721) 
 now I'm like depressed. Because like, man I guess I got a few months here and now I want to just go. You know, it's like when you get psyched up.  I haven't decided. I heard there's some people, you know, if you want to be like a, you can even do teaching over there, like teach English, or you can be a  a nanny. It's like so you know it's like if I you know the right right right position opens up I might not be coming back anytime soon.  Really? 

Recording: (10072/ 10721) 
 It's like down a hill kinda by the horseshoe, yeah. So that's where we go. And I don't have a student ID so I just sneak in. But it's the summer, they don't even care. They never. 

Recording: (10073/ 10721) 
 it did okay, it's still around. It just didn't do as good as I thought it was going to do. Dumb morons. What idiot doesn't put a 3.5 drive on a computer? That was stupid. That was just dumb  marketing. That was dumb marketing.  I never use it. I do everything. I've got all kinds of verdicts.  Yeah. 

Recording: (10074/ 10721) 
 But he's also, like I said, he's got five kids. They live in low-income housing. They're collecting welfare. 

Recording: (10075/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10076/ 10721) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (10077/ 10721) 
 for the profit.  down but then I always will find another project. So and I rehab houses whenever I get a chance I like to do that. 

Recording: (10078/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10079/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (10080/ 10721) 
 And so eventually he did. He just got used to her. 

Recording: (10081/ 10721) 
 so i gave myself a long weekend yeah it is, i wish i had been last weekend it was real nice last weekend so i gave myself a long weekend  Catch up. Sleep a little bit, run around. My daughter's getting ready to go to Italy, so that's... 

Recording: (10082/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (10083/ 10721) 
 that kind of stuff. So it was mostly like what we would do is we would talk about, we'd talk about like medication, like as far as why you're in labor. 

Recording: (10084/ 10721) 
 or anything like that. I mean, that's something that I don't know, I'd sort of make known to them, but not something that I'd really push.  on them. 

Recording: (10085/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10086/ 10721) 
 Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (10087/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yep. 

Recording: (10088/ 10721) 
 No, I am definitely in favor of that. I mean, yes, the parent is supposed to do it, and one would hope that the parent would get there before the health  class did, but if the parent isn't going to get there, it's the only way they're ever going to find out. 

Recording: (10089/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10090/ 10721) 
 was really great. I mean it's just nice laid back country setting and you don't have to worry about that much crime while your horse might get taken in  I'm gonna go out in the middle of the night, but I don't have any horses.

But then they can't hear.  you when you say, ok, the time's up, stop now, or whatever. You're going, hey, hey, poke him! So I don't usually let the kids listen to their  get phones. Maybe the last week of school in June or something, or maybe right around Christmas time, but most of the time I don't because I get too out

Recording: (10095/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10096/ 10721) 
 Right, right. I think there's so many small communities, like even though OSU has really, obviously its own little community and then you've got Dublin and they've  their own parades and their own different things. So I agree. I mean I think that there really is a lot of things to do in that own individual area. I can't see somebody from Dublin going over  to the west side to do anything. You know what I don't and maybe also I feel safer where I live too and that's something that's an issue for me. I know 

Recording: (10097/ 10721) 
 But it's a very unstructured and non-structured environment, which my son wouldn't have worked in, and they don't have sports. But these kids get  scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the United States, and we're talking big money scholars, full scholarships. So if they are able to do it there,  at that one school, you know, they could. 

Recording: (10098/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10099/ 10721) 
 But that economy is coming along too. It's developing itself, which is nice. I took a tour of a plant down there.  My old man had business down there so I went down just to see it. It seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better. Granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day.  a day. But they get bused into work because none of them have cars. And then on top of that, they all get a meal because they're

 At this point, I blame it on the administration. And the citizens of Columbus have an  I mean, two years ago, or was it three years ago now, they defeated a levy. You should never defeat a school levy. 

Recording: (10102/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10103/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (10104/ 10721) 
 and how are you? And I know like one point in time it's like, we don't want to hang out with you, Crystal. I'm like, well fine, I don't care. I'll go hang out with them.  It's like they still need to do a lot of growing up.

 I can't eat seafood, but I tried some once when I went to Las Vegas with my dad. My mom didn't cook it at home, which I'm glad she did.  didn't. The smell of fish always kind of bothered me but until I tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes I broke out in tears.  to a rash. I mean it was like a heat rash. It started on my neck. 

Recording: (10111/ 10721) 
 I used to fish and stuff like that, but I've had skin cancer, I've had poor heart attacks, and if you look at my skin now, you see all the blisters and stuff on it. 

Recording: (10112/ 10721) 
 Yeah, to me that's sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you've done, that the kid did and you don't want him to do it again and let it go.  I got this version of the story from the Columbus Dispatch so it's probably not the whole story.  Yeah, it is. 

Recording: (10113/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (10114/ 10721) 
 By the end I was pretty much just puking up blood and passing out a lot.

 I'm a freelance artist, illustrator, in fact, marketing communications for Ohio State is one of my big clients.  And I also have various part-time jobs for the medical insurance. 

Recording: (10121/ 10721) 
 Really? I know, so it's like the same deal with Canada, you know, like how it used to be owned by, okay. 

Recording: (10122/ 10721) 
 Your kid would be thrown in jail, you'd be getting sued for not having insurance.

 And I don't know whether Orrin did or not, he's never said anything if he has.  I think my attitude would be, don't tell.  The guys that come out vary vociferously in

Recording: (10129/ 10721) 
 It's like if America, we're used to being raised one way. If we went to another country, just kind of like you might want to get to know the Chinese people, but you might not.  quite be a little timid about, you know, same kind of thing. But I'm not, I don't have any of those barriers.

I'd go, what did they say, you know, about,  your dress and she goes, Jelena, is that you? And I go, see, you clean up really nice. I said, you know, you have the best shape you're ever going to have in your life. And what do you do? You wear these big baggy  clothes and these saggy pants. I said, you know, when you get when you get in your 50s and you've got a gut and a big ass, you know, you could do that.

 Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (10134/ 10721) 
 bring this attribute to the table and you can help the team out, then why not reward you? Instead of putting you over here in let's say a managerial position, which you really don't have any  call for but you're there because the money only okay so try and put the attribute to the person and compensate them accordingly which I think we did that we have  teachers. 

Recording: (10135/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (10136/ 10721) 
 To be close, so I didn't have to drive. 

Recording: (10137/ 10721) 
 But they lived in a beautiful home. I mean kids like that I could see if they're poor in Harlem or whatever, but these kids lived in  a nice neighborhood and a beautiful home in Colorado. I mean, you know, I just think they were removed from what their children, their son was doing. 

Recording: (10138/ 10721) 
 I like Johnstown better if you really want to know, but there aren't as many places to fish up there.  Well, is that good enough? 

Recording: (10139/ 10721) 
 And then they said, and after you get your master's, you'll definitely need your doctorate. Well, you know, the people saying this are college people. College is a business.  And it takes a while to realize that. If you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships, that's good.  and even now being a person with a semi-disability from a brain injury, I mean I don't even like to call it 

Recording: (10140/ 10721)

 Yeah, yeah, I think it was just a political thing.

 And we'd adjust the guns, call down shifts, so they could come within reasonable, close to that.

 Well, he told a Jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the Holocaust went to hell because they were Jewish. 

Recording: (10160/ 10721) 
 Right. Right. When it's just frustration after frustration. Yeah. But I don't see that in the Catholic school. Not in the Catholic school. They're not even  paid as well as the public schools, but the environment is better for education. 

Recording: (10161/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (10162/ 10721) 
 I mean, I don't think they should get rid of it for Polaris thing. But there's plenty of malls to go to if that's okay.  It's not a big deal to me to tell you truth. No, actually I live, I live closer. I live east more.  more.

 95% of you are poor as dirt, 3% of you are right in the middle, and 2% of you are extremely wealthy. And the vast majority, like I said, 95% are dirt poor.  I don't want to do that. My dad's a doctor. I was raised in high society. I don't want to leave high society. I like it there. I like it there a lot.  So I was like, I better get out of the music thing. So I decided to go into business.

 Yeah, she lives over by Riverside Hospital. 

Recording: (10182/ 10721) 
 So she did. I don't know whether it was more than a year or not. I think it was forty  dollars a month and of course that was forty dollars more than they had otherwise and  Then I think that, let's see, she, when she went out there,

 painfully clear that she shouldn't plan on having a career because she's going to have to raise children at some point, which is  That's not the way things should work in my belief and the fact that it's like the males telling the daughter this is how  how things need to be. I think an individual should have the choice. But I feel, I'm concerned about a  you

 Well, we figure in a few years he will. 

Recording: (10201/ 10721) 
 They have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you don't want to do it. Most usually I just put location. I don't want to go to the other side.  go certain places.

 you 

Recording: (10203/ 10721) 
 Yeah, you can't have a beer gut and a big ass. And it means you're sloppy and lazy if you do, but if a man does, it's like, my God, he's probably got some power behind it.  him and it's like duh he's probably just as lazy as anybody else it's like you know you know I hate to see girls starving themselves to death you know it's like you know there are certain  times in your life where you're going to be fat. My youngest daughter has a problem with that. I don't know why she's so insecure because she, out of the four of us, including 

Recording: (10204/ 10721) 
 Yeah, like when I need things and I call him up, I need diapers, I need wipes, I need $20. Yeah, he's there for me for that. Financially, yeah, he's always been there.  For me. 

Recording: (10205/ 10721) 
 Yeah, plus a lot of work stress that she's had and stuff. 

Recording: (10206/ 10721) 
 But if you get to the point where there isn't, then you just have to be in the situation. In my situation, I think for my parents, it's better that they  split up because they're both very happy now. 

Recording: (10207/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10208/ 10721) 
 Everybody needs to know that information. For credit cards. 

Recording: (10209/ 10721) 
 I defended my stepmother against the rest of my family immediately following my father's death because there was some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother. So my sister and I defended my stepmother.  mother against the rest of my family, stepmother eventually shafted us and so stepmother is evil.

 Um... 

Recording: (10212/ 10721) 
 couldn't spend a week there with you. So you hope that doesn't happen, but I've heard friends say, you know, their 13 year olds just rolled over from one to  the other, from the best kid in town to I'm running away, I'm never going to school again. So it's tough and you wonder what causes that.  It seems pretty random. I guess a lot of it is the kids they  MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.

 improvement in three months and all that kind of, it was image and we were saying the same thing, you know, we want to continue this, we want to make even this better.  We learn to say the negatives in a positive way and that's important. You need to appeal to the center.  Americans don't like extreme liberals. They don't like extreme conservatives. They want peace. 

Recording: (10216/ 10721) 
 And it would take like years I would think to implement the program successfully.

 Well... 

Recording: (10218/ 10721) 
 Now, most of my paintings were completed before, like 1995, 1996, before it came back out. It was more of a  a thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it's suddenly you hear about it more often so that's not a little funny about it used to be probably like I  I paint Star Wars. 

Recording: (10219/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10220/ 10721) 
 You learn a heck of a lot from that aging person. A heck of a lot more than you would through interviewing me, really.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (10226/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I want to take up a couple music courses and get a little further on that, better my education and what it already is.  I don't consider myself the dumbest person, but I know I'm not the smartest. 

Recording: (10227/ 10721) 
 I didn't quite understand or hear you.

 and now it's our turn to deal with the issues. We see our parents, we see this generation, all these things that are still popular, so we don't look down on the 60s. I think the 60s sound  and like a pretty fun time to live. I'll get into politics in a second. But those things are popularized, but no, we can't do it anymore because we've got all these problems.  and the other ones.

 Okay.

 Really? 

Recording: (10238/ 10721) 
 I don't think so. In New York it might be. Like I say, it's a lot more competitive there. Here, I think Columbus is, and the Midwest in general, I think is much more  open.

Recording: (10249/ 10721) 
 It's a lot of memories. 

Recording: (10250/ 10721) 
 So I became a proud business major. 

Recording: (10251/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10252/ 10721) 
 And if I was in the same situation, I'd be doing the same thing. 

Recording: (10253/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (10254/ 10721) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (10255/ 10721) 
 Not as much as I used to be when I was younger. I used to be diehard, but not anymore.  Yeah, by their standards, but they still were 66, you know, and they probably could have won maybe a  couple more games but that's about it.

Recording: (10257/ 10721) 
 No, it didn't. As a matter of fact, I told my parents, you know, the university is handling it so well by not giving them the money because they don't deserve it. 

Recording: (10258/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10259/ 10721) 
 And my oldest sister started a school out there. 

Recording: (10260/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (10261/ 10721) 
 um... at the same time and at the same time uh... that my mother my dad split up i was  just about to start my second year at Worthington High School. So I'm about to start my sophomore year and for the first time in something like three years I'm at the school. For two years  in a row. And so I was like, no, I just finally made friends. There's no way in hell I'm leaving the friends I just finally succeeded in making. My father-in-law 

Recording: (10262/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10263/ 10721) 
 now, every once in a while with my grandmother. She always wanted me to become a nurse and I was a senior in high school when she died and sometimes I think, boy, she'd really like it that I was a nurse.  nurse because I still use her blood pressure cuff and everything. She had given me her blood pressure cuff. I mean it's very old. 

Recording: (10264/ 10721) 
 big mistake. I got to college and it just went downhill. I had all that freedom and I had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in a handbasket.  Summer, spring quarter I switched my major to music because I'm extremely musically inclined. It's one of the gifts that I've gotten.  that  90.

 I was born in Brooklyn, New York.

 There's literally hundreds of library publications. And it's a problem that librarians are facing all the time. They can't keep up. 

Recording: (10267/ 10721) 
 And like I say, I don't believe that homosexuality is taught. I think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be just fine.

 I mean, no crash or anything, but was rather scared, kind of shaken up by it. But no, they're very, very serious about designated drivers. 

Recording: (10269/ 10721) 
 The big things. 

Recording: (10270/ 10721) 
 but there were one or two eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put hours worth of research into and sketch and it was just 

Recording: (10271/ 10721) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (10272/ 10721) 
 And maybe that's why it's like that. 

Recording: (10273/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10274/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10275/ 10721) 
 Right.

 But it's a smaller Catholic school in St. Louis. 

Recording: (10278/ 10721) 
 Yeah, that's one of the drawbacks. 

Recording: (10279/ 10721) 
 If not, you just get there. The regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff, but it's interesting because the way they advertise it, they make it sound like there's this huge place and you're going to get that no matter what.  and this and that, but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (10280/ 10721) 
 So I mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them. I mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know. 

Recording: (10281/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10282/ 10721) 
 just  I hate it when people, it's obvious that if they didn't have the textbook, they wouldn't know how to do it. You know, like where if people didn't have their notes, like they wouldn't be able to do it themselves, you know?  It's kind of like, um, so I think it's when people have real enthusiasm and like, you know, put a lot of effort into making it not the

 because the mother, he played her because he was with me and she was like forget him. I don't want him to be around my child. And the other one, she's older,  She's like 10. And he says that because his daughter don't call, she only calls for when she wants things.  So he doesn't you know, he'll he'll get whatever he can for when she calls, but he doesn't spend time with her

Like if I have to choose, I'll choose gore, but that doesn't mean I necessarily like  like he's most in line with a lot of my stuff with a lot of my views. Don't get me wrong I'm not completely liberal on everything like there's certain things I guess maybe because going to school in Ashland  it just rubs off on you. There's certain things like I'm not so liberal about but I don't really, like gorgeous seems so dry and just not, it's hard

 Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We're crazy. 

Recording: (10300/ 10721) 
 It might. It might. I was going to say earlier, and I forgot to mention it, is that one of the best campaigns I've seen in recent years utilizing  college-age students has been Clinton's campaign both times. He knew he needed to get a base to increase his chances of winning the election.  and did, especially in the first campaign, and I believe that was 92, did a really super job of organizing college students, because that's when you're at your most,

 Yeah.

 Well, according to government, she would have. 

Recording: (10303/ 10721) 
 And of course I think too as in America the farm families, you know, they wanted, that was more labors for the vineyards so to speak.  So I think that might have influenced a lot of that. But over the years, it just made sense to me. In fact, it looks like a  my family that the children are going to be mostly in twos, not even going to three or four. I mean it's not over yet, but my girls are

Recording: (10309/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10310/ 10721) 
 But that's part of life. When they get out in the real world, I'm talking about these guys, some will be successful in terms of whomever.  And some will be successful in other people's eyes. But the thing is, show the kids that are watching them.  There's more than just sports. Sports is a byproduct here at Ohio State.

 The parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like how to diaper your baby, whether you should leave them crying  dying in their bassinet or crib, which of course I think is horrible. I think it's good that they've come out with all these new studies that tell people don't do that. Let's see what  else was there feeding your baby.

They don't take into consideration the attributes the person has. So now we're saying okay if you bring

Recording: (10401/ 10721) 
 Town with a Channel 

Recording: (10402/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10403/ 10721) 
 Aw, isn't that cute? 

Recording: (10404/ 10721) 
 I mean, actually, I mean, I could see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to better use of some sort if they did the same kind of thing.  and we'll see you next time. 

Recording: (10405/ 10721) 
 And he paid for it when he got to college. It was rough for him to start out because he was behind then. 

Recording: (10406/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I don't think there should be any more new developments just yet.  weed out a little bit of the population. Put one part of the population in this neighborhood and just pretty much divide it all so it's not  Not too crowded one place and then not too vacant other places. 

Recording: (10407/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10408/ 10721) 
 I have no idea. It's kind of like picking the least of evils. 

Recording: (10409/ 10721) 
 and 

Recording: (10410/ 10721) 
 No, he didn't even come back. I mean, he came out, but it's like he went the other way. I thought, you know, if he get a big kick out of kicking my skin, he a little.  But you know the... 

Recording: (10411/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10412/ 10721) 
 Westland that's up in Delaware and Most of them that I talked to you know, I haven't been there a while. So I haven't really talked to whole population  of students but the ones I did talk to even their professor and whatever they're majoring in was out hanging  out at the bar. He was doing karaoke. Oh man, you should have saw him do Hang On Sleepy. 

Recording: (10413/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10414/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10415/ 10721) 
 rain. 

Recording: (10416/ 10721) 
 You wanna know where I was born? 

Recording: (10417/ 10721) 
 Yeah, talking about all these underage kids, 13, 14, 15, 16, even up to 18 years old, the Columbine shooting.  I mean, all those just relate in one category that, you know, it's getting out of control here, Bill. Do something. 

Recording: (10418/ 10721) 
 Eh. 

Recording: (10419/ 10721) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (10420/ 10721) 
 Are you sure? 

Recording: (10421/ 10721) 
 I've been playing video games since I was two. 

Recording: (10422/ 10721) 
 And it was nice just seeing that. And you could tell they were still in love and everything. And one of them had four children, one had like six. It was amazing because I  that way, but they're not still married. Getting right out of high school, I just wasn't interested in that when I was in high school at all. I was ready to go out into the world and these girls would get married so young.  and they just have no clue about life. 

Recording: (10423/ 10721) 
 Oh, yeah, exactly. I was just wondering how can I get a job doing what you're doing? 

Recording: (10424/ 10721) 
 So. 

Recording: (10425/ 10721) 
 And the data they collect is just, I mean, there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail, but the basic data, essentially how many people live in a city,  in the household and what are their ages and race and that's it. And that's not a, I don't think that's a big secret myself. 

Recording: (10426/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it's not like... There is a face behind the music, but not so much too. It's not like... 

Recording: (10427/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (10428/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I don't know. 

Recording: (10429/ 10721) 
 Like. 

Recording: (10430/ 10721) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (10431/ 10721) 
 right in there. 

Recording: (10432/ 10721) 
 Yeah, oh and that's good for the baby too. 

Recording: (10433/ 10721) 
 Maybe we're beyond that. We shouldn't always be saying that. 

Recording: (10434/ 10721) 
 The problem is lack of commitment. Lack of commitment and not saying, hey, there's a niche for you. You can't be a male. Oh, yeah, you want to do the operation? I can't be female.  Why not be happy what you are? God made you what you are. Why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can't be? 

Recording: (10435/ 10721) 
 couldn't even think about asking. 

Recording: (10436/ 10721) 
 up until March he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home and then my grandfather who's 95 got ill.  and my aunt had to choose between my son and my grandfather and she's watching actually my grandfather is doing quite well now but she watched him so we now have  him in a daycare in Hilliard. 

Recording: (10437/ 10721) 
 I'm a veteran so I get points for veterans so you know what I mean? 

Recording: (10438/ 10721) 
 Right, right. But at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested. And there was a lot of... I've always loved to travel by car.  Yeah, it's it's fun, and it's probably because of that early conditioning I've been I've been in  48 states. 

Recording: (10439/ 10721) 
 here. 

Recording: (10440/ 10721) 
 Really? 

Recording: (10441/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it was just really disgusting how they behaved and a lot of yelling at students and that was really unnecessary.  They just totally approached it from the wrong point. And I mean, there were some students that actually were supporting them. 

Recording: (10442/ 10721) 
 Right. Yeah. 

Recording: (10443/ 10721) 
 What do you think about that? Is that going too far or is that giving them necessary information that they're going to need to know?  I don't know that they would use the information that they had it. I don't know. 

Recording: (10444/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10445/ 10721) 
 yet they pray a prayer every Sunday and we believe in the seen and unseen. I'll never forget it, as I recited it for God knows how many years, but when you talk to them about possession,  when you talk to them about demons or spirits, they freak out. 

Recording: (10446/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (10447/ 10721) 
 That was all on air. 

Recording: (10448/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10449/ 10721) 
 I'm so sorry. 

Recording: (10450/ 10721) 
 So, you know, downstairs there's five different sectors, so they split the area up into five different areas. And, you know, there are some sectors down there that get extremely busy.  and then sometimes it's just like you know you're twiddling your thumbs it's it's like feast or famine you know it's not like steady like if you're working at Meijer running the cash register it's just kind of like steady  It's like you look at you know you'd be like sitting at Meijer and there's no one in your line and then you turn your back and turn back around and there's like 75 

Recording: (10451/ 10721) 
 You know, I haven't tried that. I eat tofu a little bit, but not really that much. I probably should.  It's more to soy products and there's so much nutritional value, especially for women. 

Recording: (10452/ 10721) 
 Well, yeah, yeah, a little 

Recording: (10453/ 10721) 
 Now they are. Well, my mom feeds them very well. She probably thinks, oh, they're like her green kids. 

Recording: (10454/ 10721) 
 I really didn't because I felt like I was in love with these boys. Yeah. 

Recording: (10455/ 10721) 
 That's not because I'm skilled or anything, it's because when I was a kid my dad was crippled. I had to fix everything. 

Recording: (10456/ 10721) 
 I know I didn't think that much about it. Oh, well, I'm not doing anything else. Why not?  It seems kind of silly to legally have—  two levels. I mean either you're going to do it the hard way or you're not. 

Recording: (10457/ 10721) 
 It was a guinea pig type situation. It was probably better in high school. It was more college prep. 

Recording: (10458/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10459/ 10721) 
 I had a student bring me a paper today. He said, this is for history. I have to write an essay on Anthony Wayne. 

Recording: (10460/ 10721) 
 I'm an independent. 

Recording: (10461/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10462/ 10721) 
 Yeah, they only have like a couple days in each city. That's not much. I like going someplace and spending a week and just exploring. 

Recording: (10463/ 10721) 
 And that type of person I don't think would make a very effective president because, I don't know, president needs to be able to think fast on their feet. 

Recording: (10464/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's either gonna be find the house we want or we'll go build it somewhere 

Recording: (10465/ 10721) 
 You just get sent wherever. 

Recording: (10466/ 10721) 
 And I'm saying I could take that route, but it would cost me a lot of money that I don't have to get the legal defense. And it'd be just best for me to take the responsibility.  I'm going to pay back the apartment complex that I signed a lease for.  uh... but i'm gonna make them come after me you know uh... already went to court once and and uh... 

Recording: (10467/ 10721) 
 Get it from us. 

Recording: (10468/ 10721) 
 really oh my god and then you can hash mark them if you want we didn't but you could and we had two people who  um... said you're kidding and said nevermind i'm sorry but i mean i never even said that well somebody must have done this before because everybody else  is just like there's no other response. 

Recording: (10469/ 10721) 
 Aww. 

Recording: (10470/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10471/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, they were more settled. 

Recording: (10472/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (10473/ 10721) 
 No, it's just a regular old renter cop with his own van. He'd hop in, I'll give you a ride.  drove me to the corner of the middle of nowhere in accordance to where I live and then I had to walk all the way.  Home. 

Recording: (10474/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10475/ 10721) 
 Well, I- 

Recording: (10476/ 10721) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (10477/ 10721) 
 Praise the Lord and hands in the air and singing and dancing and people falling over and and She's she really introduced me to that  And then we dated for about three months and I, both of us decided, okay, this is, we accomplished what we were supposed to accomplish in this relationship.  you've introduced me to something and I've introduced you to something and now we're going to go our separate ways." And so we separated. And then I found my 

Recording: (10478/ 10721) 
 Yeah. So. 

Recording: (10479/ 10721) 
 My mom's from Akron. Actually, one of my dad's really good friends went to the same  church denomination that my mom did. And my dad went with his friend to a summer camp that they had and that's where they actually first met and my dad  I was extremely taken with her. 

Recording: (10480/ 10721) 
 And they were just wild, you know. I just ran every minute. And I took it as a substitute and didn't know from day to day, you know, whether it was going to keep it. I finally had to say,  I can't do this. 27 kindergartens. I'm sorry, I can't do this by myself. 

Recording: (10481/ 10721) 
 And I don't think he really understood that. He might someday. 

Recording: (10482/ 10721) 
 Really? So is it, is that so like the economy's pretty good right now? Well, right now. It's shaky? Okay.  Not too many dot-coms apparently over there. 

Recording: (10483/ 10721) 
 That's 

Recording: (10484/ 10721) 
 Well, I can only speak from my relationship. My dad was out of town quite a bit when we were growing up. So from a maternal aspect,  you know, mom was there all the time. And a lot of times she filled both the male and the female, the mother and the father role, you know, as far as  punish button or anything like that. But it just would depend. I know in my respect it 

Recording: (10485/ 10721) 
 We were on, like each person would be on a team of these kids, they'd be assigned to these kids, and you'd go to your team meetings and the doctors, the shrinks would go.  Well, I got two weeks off at Christmas. You know, they'd be bitching and moaning about the fact that we got time off and they didn't. And I finally came up with the perfect thing one time.  I said, well, Dr. Simpson or whatever his name was, Dr. Brown, you know how it is. Some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off. 

Recording: (10486/ 10721) 
 jewelry, a few other minor things. But he didn't want his TV and VCR and those kind of things to get stolen, so he moved them back home.  Then he started worrying about something else and that moves back. Then he's worried about his car because somebody down the street got their car stolen. So it's just going to be a matter of rearranging.  He's applying for another scholarship. He gets some already. So if he would get this other scholarship, I think it would help him. 

Recording: (10487/ 10721) 
 You know? 

Recording: (10488/ 10721) 
 brother 

Recording: (10489/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, all the time. 

Recording: (10490/ 10721) 
 that I wanted them to file charges on him. And they said, well, no, he's not met the criteria.  I said, well, he doesn't get to school sometimes until lunchtime. They said, well, he gets here just in time to not be here.  be counted tardy or not tardy but 

Recording: (10491/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10492/ 10721) 
 No, there's a lot of people that go to church that aren't worth anything too, you know, so I don't really believe that going to church, you know, makes you a better human being than another.  human being. I believe that most people's basic structure in life, if it's based similar to the Bible,  or you could say Buddhism or whatever, you know, that you tend to have a better life than you will if you practice non-Buddhism. 

Recording: (10493/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (10494/ 10721) 
 But why would you make stricter gun laws when you can't even force your traffic laws? 

Recording: (10495/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (10496/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10497/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (10498/ 10721) 
你 

Recording: (10499/ 10721) 
 You can get lost in mathematics almost, I think you could, of course, now they probably have. 

Recording: (10500/ 10721) 
 So, I mean, carrying cabinets and he'll do it. As long as you're paying him, he'll do it. 

Recording: (10501/ 10721) 
 And these kids that are violent, your whole society is violent. I got, okay, I just got done helping my sister-in-law. That's an example right there. She's got five kids.  She's on welfare. Her husband is Arab, right? 

Recording: (10502/ 10721) 
 Yeah, true. So are you, you're obviously computer literate. Yes. Is your roommate helping you with this? No, actually my roommate's in Colorado right now.  And he's going to be there. 

Recording: (10503/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10504/ 10721) 
 where we usually film. 

Recording: (10505/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10506/ 10721) 
 And that's actually a really interesting thing too, because especially coming back and moving all my stuff out of storage, I've just been on this, I'm getting rid of half  of everything I own because over there it's you know it just feels so weird to come back and I feel so loaded down especially when I've spent so much time just living out of a suitcase you know I just  really realize I have so much stuff that I don't need because there you know everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes you know there isn't stuff all around everything's more 

Recording: (10507/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10508/ 10721) 
 I wouldn't. 

Recording: (10509/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (10510/ 10721) 
 Why? I mean, it's part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent, then why don't you talk about it? And the problem is that they don't know the answer.  answer. And if they don't know the answer, if they can't give a firm this is the answer, then they avoid it. So what do you do if you don't know the answer? I try and find  I try and find for me what has become the best answer. If I don't believe something or I don't know what to believe about something, 

Recording: (10511/ 10721) 
 I'm not saying that it's not right for some people, but you know it wasn't right for my son. 

Recording: (10512/ 10721) 
 And whenever you have a heart attack anymore, they always suspect coke is the first thing. 

Recording: (10513/ 10721) 
 At the end of March I go to Europe and I travel around for a minimum of 100 days with a backpack on my back. 

Recording: (10514/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10515/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (10516/ 10721) 
 No, they thought it was, my dad told me later, he thought I was getting sent off just by myself, you know. 

Recording: (10517/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (10518/ 10721) 
 were adopted by two dads. It's difficult to adopt children, and it should be. And so the children, they would likely  take would be trouble to begin with. 

Recording: (10519/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10520/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we do a lot of interlibrary loan, too. 

Recording: (10521/ 10721) 
 that's good. No, not really actually. Some I have and then I've run into people that just like anything they want to get out of their hometown. They don't like it. They complain.  but normally I find that those people aren't taking advantage of the free art shows and the things that are free. I'm like, oh, have you done this? No.  I didn't even know about it. You've lived here all your life and I've only lived here X number of years. 

Recording: (10522/ 10721) 
 So that's what I did and I went to some foster homes and things like that.  And lived in Delaware for a while, you know, got out of high school and got married. 

Recording: (10523/ 10721) 
 You know, the, I don't know, there's something I could say.  see  well they want to put me on some kind of anti-hallucinogenic medication and I said well listen man you know I'm not hallucinating 

Recording: (10524/ 10721) 
 No. 

Recording: (10525/ 10721) 
 Yeah. Yeah. It'd be good though, because I could take care of the books and everything and do all that kind of thing. 

Recording: (10526/ 10721) 
 I have no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman, but if that was the relationship for everybody, 

Recording: (10527/ 10721) 
 right. 

Recording: (10528/ 10721) 
 My youngest daughter, when I was crabbing about, I talked to them and they said, we're coming to Ohio in a couple weeks. I said, good, are you going to come and see us? Well, no, we weren't planning that.  said well why well we're not driving a Dodie's retinas the car well all that meant was my sister was running the car but he was driving the car I said well then how are  are you going to get to these other places? And normally I wouldn't do that. I would just let it go. Well, Dodie's right in that car. And I said, well, aren't you driving it? Well, well, yeah. 

Recording: (10529/ 10721) 
 No, no, no, it's just a small independent. 

Recording: (10530/ 10721) 
 Well, and. 

Recording: (10531/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10532/ 10721) 
 I know. Well, when you become a mother, you tend to ignore things too. 

Recording: (10533/ 10721) 
 people call up and they have no idea what they want it's like why did you do this like why did you do this to me the coffin of the lake yeah i'm thinking about getting a blanket uh... what do you think  about those like it's real funny when people ask me my opinion like on things like this like it's funny when people call up who are close to our age too.  It's funny to hear. 

Recording: (10534/ 10721) 
 Yeah, there are times when, you know, just there's a group over there called Star Check. 

Recording: (10535/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10536/ 10721) 
 He wasn't a bad kid. 

Recording: (10537/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10538/ 10721) 
 I think sometimes there's a tradeoff between time and money and you just have to look at it and say which is really more important. 

Recording: (10539/ 10721) 
 I 

Recording: (10540/ 10721) 
 Walk us all the way through the hospital. 

Recording: (10541/ 10721) 
 And one of my friends was like, what'd you say? And he took that as like a threat or something, like walked over. 

Recording: (10542/ 10721) 
 Oh, yes. Yes. 

Recording: (10543/ 10721) 
 So if you're not wearing the Nikes. 

Recording: (10544/ 10721) 
 I think it is a good idea because I've won my fair share of money on the lottery. They give everybody a fair chance, you know, they don't just minimize it to one.  or two. You know some of them have options and some of them don't. 

Recording: (10545/ 10721) 
 That's fine. I don't.  My husband does, but I kind of sleep between them when they're, but right now I've, because we, early on we,  took our bed down and just kind of had like the banters and the box spring on the floor. And I've got like comforters on the side of the bed. So because 

Recording: (10546/ 10721) 
 Iran  about it during his presidency. It was some Republican right wing, I don't know what, who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing.  nothing. It was not Watergate. He may have been a cad, but she was 21. It's not like it was someone who couldn't make up her own mind 

Recording: (10547/ 10721) 
 And they're not willing to do that for gifted students. 

Recording: (10548/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10549/ 10721) 
 nobody around, nothing but land. 

Recording: (10550/ 10721) 
 It's a little farther. 

Recording: (10551/ 10721) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (10552/ 10721) 
 I didn't want to go to Dallas. 

Recording: (10553/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, and you know they're like $3.50 for a pack of cards. You don't even get gum like we used to with the baseball cards. Yeah, you get, I don't know, five, six cards  for $350. And I'm like, jeez, you count every time you go to the store, they got them all in there. Check out, let's get the cards. Now they've done the first $150, they're moving on to  Series two, you know. Oh, they are, they're killing it. They really are. 

Recording: (10554/ 10721) 
 Why don't you do that for a year? And not do it for a year, just go down for the day and then come back to Upper Arlington at night and live. How do you like to do that? 

Recording: (10555/ 10721) 
 Well like, I'm a philosophy minor so like if you look at like different ethical theories and stuff like, like there's a hierarchy kind of.  This is what I've found. There's a hierarchy of things that are, like the inalienable rights, for instance. Like, I can't, if you come into my house and rob me,  and then run outside. To kill you for stealing my property, there's a hierarchy there. For stealing another life, that's why 

Recording: (10556/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, that was a job, helping them to move. 

Recording: (10557/ 10721) 
 right? 

Recording: (10558/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10559/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10560/ 10721) 
 know, wider version of what they call it. It's in that magazine there. What triggers the violence and violence  thoughts. People actually do think more about the violence when they commit it than the accidental, you know. Some of it's mind  Some of it's not, but everybody thinks. 

Recording: (10561/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (10562/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, it's only it's still 10 till 7. Yeah 

Recording: (10563/ 10721) 
 You know, my daughter, you know, there's just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and I'd call up to the school and, you know, the principal like, he'd say, Miss, you know, I'm.  I am her last chance. You know, my daughter was going to summer school every summer.  And he's like Mrs. You know she's like you know the average student.  you 

Recording: (10564/ 10721)

 He's a subcontractor and if someone's got a job to do at their house he'll do it.  just went and tore the cabins out of a house that was on fire because of the smoke damage. 

Recording: (10567/ 10721) 
 You know, anything probably? No? You know, so. 

Recording: (10568/ 10721) 
 Yeah, my brother didn't know what the heck to do with a checkbook.

 Really? 

Recording: (10572/ 10721) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (10573/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (10574/ 10721) 
 There is a web access to some of our systems in Manitoba. We're putting more uniform on it for everything. OSU has its own system.  but they can also connect to our system for things they don't have in their system. So I'm not sure what system you're talking about. 

Recording: (10575/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10576/ 10721) 
 So basically, well yeah it might work, but to me it's kind of stupid, because what you're saying is we're going to take this law and we're really going to stick you on this law, but to hell with all the other ones.  So is that really fair? 

Recording: (10577/ 10721) 
 applicants to get more placements for interviews and that sort of thing. And I developed that method, the mechanism, the checklist and stuff.  I worked on that. And then I worked for the last three years in jobs training for economically disadvantaged youth, adults, and dislocated workers. 

Recording: (10578/ 10721) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (10579/ 10721)

 Commodore 64 is. They've heard of it, but they really don't know what a brilliant system it was at its initial stage.  and it just got bowled over because, you know, something better came out. Something better will come out than Windows. Microsoft will eventually go under.  It's just going to take a while. Oh yeah. I give it probably about six or seven years before somebody comes out with a system that's just as good as mine.

 Well, he's exporting cars illegally. 

Recording: (10584/ 10721) 
 They've got to have the best of everything, the best of... It's like, you know, to me, you just have to kind of think about things a little bit. And it's like, you know, do I really need to go  to  other part for maybe like a book for my kid or you know they have like my daughter's in swimming I need the money for a swimsuit well why don't I use it for that you know so it's 

Recording: (10585/ 10721) 
 Real war. 

Recording: (10586/ 10721) 
 Reality strikes. 

Recording: (10587/ 10721) 
 So you go and talk to people?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I know a lot of people.  to do, but I know a lot of people who don't. 

Recording: (10588/ 10721) 
 with no motivation to do their job properly.  Now, I live down the street from what they call Cause, it's Columbus Alternative High School.  through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the Columbus schools. And those kids leave there getting full 

Recording: (10589/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10590/ 10721) 
 These editors are so paranoid, you know what I mean? They're more worried about stopping. 

Recording: (10591/ 10721) 
 We wanted it to keep on going. They just didn't need to do like that. And then I think once they noticed that the comments were  were going to open without them, they realized that the university is functioning or was functioning fine without them. 

Recording: (10592/ 10721) 
 and  indigenous cultures throughout the world will tell you and the history will show that those people were revered as gifted. 

Recording: (10593/ 10721) 
 Yeah, it was easy. 

Recording: (10594/ 10721) 
 when I would run away from foster homes. 

Recording: (10595/ 10721) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (10596/ 10721) 
 So that's where she went to high school and everything. But no, I never went out there. My ex-wife's family is here, so she can  back a couple three times a year and I generally try to hook up with her and it's been a while but as she got older you know she wants to  be with her playmates and everything as they get older. And having went through that myself, I understand that.  you 

Recording: (10597/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah, and you don't want to listen to any music with words because then you'll start singing the words and then you won't be able to read. 

Recording: (10598/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10599/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10600/ 10721) 
 Yes and no. When we were in Boy Scouts, we got kicked out of it. 

Recording: (10601/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10602/ 10721) 
 mhm 

Recording: (10603/ 10721) 
 I don't agree with it, we had gays in there when I was in there, you know, so. 

Recording: (10604/ 10721) 
 Is it okay? I'm sorry. 

Recording: (10605/ 10721) 
 It happens sometimes, probably my freshman year in high school, we were just walking down high street and I guess we were in the wrong place  the wrong time and some people were like yelling stuff and we couldn't make out what they were saying. 

Recording: (10606/ 10721) 
 I know that they changed it. I know that it used to just be one day, I guess, because of the health care, something like that. I feel like a day and a half certainly would be long enough  for me. I mean, unless there's some type of complications, I would be perfectly ready to go home, you know, unless there's something extra that they could do for me there. 

Recording: (10607/ 10721) 
 Don't worry. 

Recording: (10608/ 10721) 
 No, no, but. 

Recording: (10609/ 10721) 
 He's just disruptive. And he said, OK. A week later, she said, we didn't get any bad reports. Thank you. And she said, are you going to continue? I said, yeah, it's a lot easier for the rest of you.  year we have no rad reports from 

Recording: (10610/ 10721) 
 I know, ever, forever. Another thing is people are, the friends of mine are always saying, could you take care of my business for me? Like, could I do their checkbook? Of course I'm not going to do their checkbook.  like this, show them how to keep things in order. 

Recording: (10611/ 10721) 
 Yeah, then it's come home. Then it's come home to the... And it's so different. I don't know, it's just the motherly thing. The kids just, they draw to their mothers.  you 

Recording: (10612/ 10721) 
 Yeah, well like the catalogs real small and we have like 500,000 things and like the catalog has like a hundred of them So that's really annoying too because then people call  up with all these like things that we like don't know if we have our computers are really really old like it's like an old style mainframe 

Recording: (10613/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10614/ 10721) 
 How are they going to make sure that they'll lock us on again? I mean, that just seems like a waste of money to me.  All you're doing is letting a company sell a trigger lock for a gun and make somebody have to buy it.  buy one, but you're not gonna make him put it on the gun, so. 

Recording: (10615/ 10721) 
 did this in the mid 60s when we drove up that way in the early 60s there was there were fields there were farms there were  There were forests, none of that stuff out there. And it's just amazing the urban sprawl that's taken over out there. 

Recording: (10616/ 10721) 
 that goes away about age 8. My kids, they're still doing it. They might make an 8 from the bottom up instead of from the top down or a 6  from the bottom up. I even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up. You could tell by watching them write that their brain didn't work like yours did. 

Recording: (10617/ 10721) 
 Yeah, because I've thought about that. Like, well, maybe I'll just wait a few years and start dating. 

Recording: (10618/ 10721) 
 How appalling. Oh yeah. Yeah. My, my  family, my mom especially, is just like, when are you going to stop doing that? Yeah, because he's 16 months now. And I think he's tapering off quite a  bit so I think that he'll be done soon but I'm not pushing him so 

Recording: (10619/ 10721) 
 We'll see that's not proved out by the approval ratings. He still has a higher approval rating than Reagan had in his last 18 months. So, you know, people still like what he's done.  I think that people don't like all the crap that went with him as the pundits on TV. They say that and they're still trying to get him.  Before he was even elected, they were trying to get him, which is what they would have done to Elizabeth Dole. They wouldn't have been able to attack on the issue, so they'd find other things to get him. 

Recording: (10620/ 10721) 
 I'm sitting here now, Scott, I bet you on Monday night's game tonight, 9 o'clock, la la la, so and so will win. You know, don't exchange any money or have any money figured out.  years planned out just you know oh well that's your team that's my team let's go at it. 

Recording: (10621/ 10721) 
 but it was very difficult for him to be task oriented. 

Recording: (10622/ 10721) 
 take them to the grocery store afterwards usually. So it does take up a big part of Sunday. And I don't do it as regularly now because of the  advance in age, you know. 

Recording: (10623/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10624/ 10721) 
 had one while I was there. I have two kids, 29 and 22. They're real good.  it. 

Recording: (10625/ 10721) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (10626/ 10721) 
 I think 

Recording: (10627/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I'm at the end of it all. 

Recording: (10628/ 10721) 
 You know. 

Recording: (10629/ 10721) 
 I'm kind of happy I'm not doing that anymore. It really takes a certain type of person to work for and that's hard to find in that area. 

Recording: (10630/ 10721) 
 No, no, but that's what I'm saying. But that's what I'm saying. And the same thing is happening when we had a bus thing. We took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment. Oh, they got the taste of it and then went back home.  And we did a very unjust thing to those kids and to the families. And then when we broke them up, we did something else, you know, we lost that community.  community involvement so now the parents can't follow their kids to their activities. Again, splitting it up. Hey, we don't want families. That's a misnomer. 

Recording: (10631/ 10721) 
 afterwards too, and that's one of the things they've asked for in the adoption agreement. And if the couple's willing to do that. 

Recording: (10632/ 10721) 
 arts and communications, but it's been more of a problem than it's been an asset. Interviewing for jobs, people that were  doing the interviewing had just a high school education and they're not going to hire me when after a year I'd be their  your boss. So a lot of that is out there regardless of what people say. I'm not trying to be pessimistic or negative. 

Recording: (10633/ 10721) 
 That's 

Recording: (10634/ 10721) 
 uh-huh yeah they were all right other Columbus Sally  I don't know if you know who she is. 

Recording: (10635/ 10721) 
 Fuck! 

Recording: (10636/ 10721) 
 There has been some serious consideration, but no, there was some, someone took up a petition and was urging him to do it, but he's decided he did not want to devote that much time  away from his television program. Oh, he's quite a smart fellow, really.  I can't remember all the names of the shows, so I don't watch them, but I knew Oak Ridge  Let's see what it's just got for... 

Recording: (10637/ 10721) 
 Archie Bunker meets Fred Flintstone. There you go. I can't really put him in the category of  Forest Gump because Forest Gump was a great guy. 

Recording: (10638/ 10721) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (10639/ 10721) 
 It's crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything. And I've got, oh my gosh, they're like, just give me a list. And somebody's like, I want to get this, and I want to get that. So it's just been.  It's been something else, which is good though because our families are pretty similar and they're all 

Recording: (10640/ 10721) 
 I don't know where I'm going to find you, honestly, I'm thinking of doing a career flight. 

Recording: (10641/ 10721) 
 I like living in a world where technology is  technology puts everything I need at my fingertips. I mean, I think that's something that would not have happened had there not been a  a highly populist generation suddenly that was competing within itself. 

Recording: (10642/ 10721) 
 He said, I didn't think you'd stand up to me. I said, well, you know, what the heck? 

Recording: (10643/ 10721) 
 I hope they keep it. 

Recording: (10644/ 10721) 
 He has the most experience. 

Recording: (10645/ 10721) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (10646/ 10721) 
 What the fuck? 

Recording: (10647/ 10721) 
 Um... 

Recording: (10648/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Recording: (10649/ 10721) 
 or something like that. 

Recording: (10650/ 10721) 
 I grew up in Massillon, Ohio. I'm the oldest of five children. I have four children of my own. I was married  I got married many years ago and I've been married to my husband now for 21 years and we have three children together.  19 who's a sophomore at Ohio Wesleyan. My older daughter's a graduate from Ohio. I'm a graduate of Ohio. I have a son who's 9. Let's see, Joe is 

Recording: (10651/ 10721) 
 I didn't want to be like... 

Recording: (10652/ 10721) 
 I was born in Boston, lived there, but I moved away before I really even remember it. Moved to Detroit. When I was there, I spent about 10 years  there and then moved to Ohio with my family of course and then right now I'm at Ashland University but I'm thinking about coming to OSU.  That's why I came down for the summer, because I have friends down here. So I'm taking a look at it. So basically, that's basically geographically where I've been. 

Recording: (10653/ 10721) 
 Makes it difficult. It's an adjustment. 

Recording: (10654/ 10721) 
 the bonding. 

Recording: (10655/ 10721) 
 I tell you it's mine now. 

Recording: (10656/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10657/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, you get a lot of those. 

Recording: (10658/ 10721) 
 The reason I asked was, it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to  Go to Sunday school. Starting asking questions about religion and you're saying, well, I suppose I could answer all these, but.  Yeah 

Recording: (10659/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I really, really hate the fact of government telling me what to do. 

Recording: (10660/ 10721) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (10661/ 10721) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (10662/ 10721) 
 So... 

Recording: (10663/ 10721) 
 Yeah, he was. He's going to always be real. I like that he's got his... yeah.

Recording: (10665/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10666/ 10721) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (10667/ 10721) 
 If you do that to ten things, it's something that's integral to the university's collection. It really hits your budget.  And then there's always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it. 

Recording: (10668/ 10721) 
 I do. 

Recording: (10669/ 10721) 
 Didn't hear about that. 

Recording: (10670/ 10721) 
 And I guess it worked for them. 

Recording: (10671/ 10721) 
 to marry him and she moved over and 

Recording: (10672/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (10673/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10674/ 10721) 
 Yeah, and as I got older, I continued to lose interest in it. 

Recording: (10675/ 10721) 
 I don't know. 

Recording: (10676/ 10721) 
 So... 

Recording: (10677/ 10721) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (10678/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I know, I know, I know. 

Recording: (10679/ 10721) 
 Reader's Digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level. They now write it on the sixth grade level. Newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level.  It's just either we're getting more and more LD kids that aren't learning to read or kids are just not as motivated because  because of video games and things that, well, I read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set, 

Recording: (10680/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (10681/ 10721) 
 Two and a half. 

Recording: (10682/ 10721) 
 And then the people that enjoy you think, why are we hiring these guys? What are they thinking? 

Recording: (10683/ 10721) 
 She has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that. 

Recording: (10684/ 10721) 
 Right. 

Recording: (10685/ 10721) 
 Oh yeah, yeah, and I think even if you're aware of everything that's here, you still, in the back of your mind, you just have that, it's just Columbus, it's just Columbus.  Maybe it's because people don't realize what's actually here.  Yeah, it's not Chicago. It's not New York. It's not San Francisco. There's a lot of places it's not. But it's not a backwater either. 

Recording: (10686/ 10721) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (10687/ 10721) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (10688/ 10721) 
 Really, I think it's really good for women to learn about this. We should have known about this 20 years ago. All these women, I know. 

Recording: (10689/ 10721) 
 a  tower works everybody landing and departing or any airplane within five mile radius. Then once they get out of that radius downstairs which is called the approach control they work everything from there  to 10,000 feet and out to about 60 miles. And when they get to that point, then they go to the enroute centers. 

Recording: (10690/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (10691/ 10721) 
 I mean, you talk to people in the Catholic Church about the unseen, meaning the spiritual realm, and they freak out. 

Recording: (10692/ 10721) 
 of mental health problems. 

Recording: (10693/ 10721) 
 you 

Recording: (10694/ 10721) 
 Yeah, I know. 

Recording: (10695/ 10721) 
 and trying to stop it. I'm trying to think of some good examples. I mean, when politicians  start talking about like biological functions. 

Recording: (10696/ 10721) 
 No, I don't work for politics. 

Recording: (10697/ 10721) 
 It's our high school trip. She's in 11th grade. 

Recording: (10698/ 10721) 
 and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right. 

Recording: (10699/ 10721) 
 It does. 

Recording: (10700/ 10721) 
 too long or a sentence that's a fragment and it isn't a complete thought. You're not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say. So give it to a friend or somebody and let them just  on your rough copy, just let them circle anything they don't understand. And that will really help you. 

Recording: (10701/ 10721) 
 But that's what they go through. 

Recording: (10702/ 10721) 
 Well, I didn't necessarily want to, but that's where my family started me out. They are alternative to the public schools, supposedly.  Just more... I don't know exactly how to explain it. The only thing that I know is that I never learned to do anything. 

Recording: (10703/ 10721) 
 something. You know, you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally.  some of them might be totally screwed up. Like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say and you say, turn to page 393 or  And they turned to 339 in their book, you know, and they think they did what you said It's just like something's mixed up between the actual eye and the ear 

Recording: (10704/ 10721) 
 Mm-hmm But that's kind of you know kind of came through where they were like when I was growing up we had the  You had your jocks and everything of course and you had your, we were called deads, you know. And I was kind of like in the middle, you know, I played a little bit of snuff.  you know, but I also associated with them and they were basically potheads, you know and everything so So I could say I you know, I was kind of associated 

Recording: (10705/ 10721) 
 Ohio State is a really good medical school. I don't know, I think they just mainly didn't want to go to OSU, like their egos or something.  I'm thinking of one in particular, you know, rich parents just wanting to go somewhere else. 

Recording: (10706/ 10721) 
 All right. 

Recording: (10707/ 10721) 
 Yeah, yeah. They're pretty good where I live. Last year when we had that really, really high snow, I shoveled and then like an hour later  it blew over so it was like what's the point but our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalks 

Recording: (10708/ 10721) 
 no painting was needed. Then as a result they went through and decided since I broke the lease to get some more  money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating. And even though that evidence  was in front of a magistrate. 

Recording: (10709/ 10721) 
 I'm going to come up there." I said, sure, drive by. He said, continue on. I said, okay, fine, no problem. Then I could call Evan and say, he will be there in  three hours, there'll be a nice silver arc, seven at this location, get in." And so she spent the next two and a half hours canceling classes and stuff. 

Recording: (10710/ 10721) 
 So there's been a lot of pressure there. 

Recording: (10711/ 10721) 
 The baby is due May 30th and graduation is June 2nd. 

Recording: (10712/ 10721)

Recording: (10713/ 10721) 
 Exactly. Yeah, you know, and you know, it's like I honestly feel the older you get the more you kind of look at what's in there as opposed to you know, gosh, that's just  $400 dress and a $300 hairdo and you know what does that mean you know it's like when we're food for maggots my feeling is some  Some people are going to say, gee, she had a really big house. And some other people are going to go, gosh, she did work in this area for free and she volunteered at this and
