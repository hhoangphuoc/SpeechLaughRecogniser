Recording: (5/ 10721) 
i think a lot of people do not understand it is a mindset they do not want to deal with numbers a lot of people or they want something easy easy and simple any term any definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind 

Recording: (6/ 10721) 
high schools like volunteering at the local senior citizens home or something like that 

Recording: (7/ 10721)

Recording: (9/ 10721) 
it is like a double scene like it is weird 

Recording: (10/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (11/ 10721) 
and i knew it had beautiful hardwood floors building bookcases and i just knew that i could have seen me wanting that house do you know what i mean it is like that identity thing somebody came through with a realtor and they made me this offer that was real low it was like $138000 and the realtor i am thinking about it because it was funny he delivered the offered him my home and i was gracious and i thanked him and i got inside and i opened up and i saw it and i went running on the porch i said wait a minute this is never gonna work 

Recording: (12/ 10721) 
back to bed rest really 

Recording: (13/ 10721) 
i mean it is something he has to deal with he has to deal with the problems with 

Recording: (14/ 10721) 
he is a commercial heating and cooling technician he works for a major company out in indianapolis 

Recording: (15/ 10721) 
i have no idea 

Recording: (16/ 10721)

Recording: (17/ 10721) 
uh huh 

Recording: (18/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (19/ 10721) 
hehehehehehe 

Recording: (20/ 10721) 
yeah i know i you know i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter almost every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was 24 when she was born i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what children are capable of or what they can do because if they are really verbal i mean i can i have talked to them from the moment they were born even when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole time 

Recording: (21/ 10721) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (22/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (23/ 10721) 
and he was going to have a group of people work out there and he said that you know i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through you know and we all just lived our lives but i was glad that he got me out there because i adored it i just loved it out there 

Recording: (24/ 10721) 
because the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and at least the daycare all the stuff they have have on their computer is all education stuff it is not game game it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (25/ 10721) 
we are animals everyone is looking for leaders it is the rules of the church simple as a rule 

Recording: (26/ 10721) 
but now it seems like people are just like i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said he grew up in the bronx 

Recording: (27/ 10721) 
i think that is kind of where i am coming from jan and i know you jan i mean what my sister does i just say to her i just really admire it i can not give as much as she gives i just do not have that same spirit she has but it is great to see i mean she is real she really when she with the people i do not know i have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and 

Recording: (28/ 10721) 
i am the oldest 

Recording: (29/ 10721) 
is 

Recording: (30/ 10721) 
and they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to people as you used to 

Recording: (31/ 10721) 
and the second tornado it was not as bad i mean we was driving up after he ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry ass back to columbus and i said okay go for it i am just sitting there smiling all the way up knowing what he did not know we get the tennis see and the weather is kind of bad there too i am like hey man slow down you do not have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm 

Recording: (32/ 10721) 
it is so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or to succumb to all the things and 90 of them as you can see what happened in washington have succumbed i do not hear any of them raising hell about what really matters in this country 

Recording: (33/ 10721) 
yeah i think a lot of times people are not real rational as far as who they go for 

Recording: (34/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (35/ 10721) 
no what do you think is wrong with it with the system 

Recording: (36/ 10721) 
honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something i do not want to deal with or whatnot so i mean the fact that people of the same sex are living together are married or whatnot that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that i love you 

Recording: (37/ 10721) 
you know yeah 

Recording: (38/ 10721) 
great 

Recording: (39/ 10721) 
but when he did have something to do with it it was kind of strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (40/ 10721) 
uh huh 

Recording: (41/ 10721) 
my wife and i had been to san francisco a couple times the first time was did all the tourist things and the next time i said let us just go and wander around around and see and spend more time both of them are good for different you know 

Recording: (42/ 10721) 
it is medicare type 

Recording: (43/ 10721) 
here at college i really have not witnessed any violence at all 

Recording: (44/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (45/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (46/ 10721) 
i mean that is an 

Recording: (47/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (48/ 10721) 
i mean there are people who think cars will not run 

Recording: (49/ 10721) 
and of course that never happened 

Recording: (50/ 10721) 
it is all up to that human being if they want to change if they got their mindset on they do not want to be with their other sex i do not think it can change you know that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (51/ 10721) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was the and when he was 14 or 16 and he really wants to go back back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work so that we can have enough money i mean we do not need to have a ton but we just should be at least a little out of debt yeah something 

Recording: (52/ 10721) 
yeah i know oh it gives me goosebumps it is such a shame 

Recording: (53/ 10721) 
something like that i do not know much about it 

Recording: (54/ 10721) 
and if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebel 

Recording: (55/ 10721) 
with that situation 

Recording: (56/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (57/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (58/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (59/ 10721) 
i was sitting down in my boyfriend is room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone i had my computer on but nobody was sitting at it 

Recording: (60/ 10721) 
so i you know they probably all hey you resemble that remark or you know 

Recording: (61/ 10721) 
for me to even think about 

Recording: (62/ 10721) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like black ass and all this you know they are prejudiced and all she is doing is yelling about being prejudiced their prejudice against her well what she do not understand is that is her damn job 

Recording: (63/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (64/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (65/ 10721) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing but neither one of our positions offer any type of parttime work we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (66/ 10721) 
except for their names were changed for these basically made up reasons 

Recording: (67/ 10721) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special ed certificate you are certified kindergarten through 12th so i did several years in the high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary while my kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that 

Recording: (68/ 10721) 
they have always been there i mean you know i do not really care what the guy is specific thing is if he is in a box hole with me you know and as long as i think you shoot a gun huh you know i mean i could care less i have got gay friends you know so 

Recording: (69/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (70/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (71/ 10721) 
it really is great 

Recording: (72/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (73/ 10721) 
they will be naked but they will still go in with a huge towel on 

Recording: (74/ 10721) 
i mean like what is his name who wrote the book 

Recording: (75/ 10721) 
which could change 

Recording: (76/ 10721) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (77/ 10721) 
i have not taken him there yet 

Recording: (78/ 10721) 
i think they should i think a lot of the fear of this material comes from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation that you can be converted to homosexuality and i personally do not believe that so i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that is where this comes from but since i think they are wrong i think i am going to go with it 

Recording: (79/ 10721) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she would just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (80/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (81/ 10721) 
but i am using me as an example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me wrong 

Recording: (82/ 10721) 
yeah he is 

Recording: (83/ 10721) 
i just did not want to do that a lot of people do that but you know it is just such an investment then when you leave 

Recording: (84/ 10721) 
yeah or more i do not even know it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together that has to work it is going to be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about elion this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this 

Recording: (85/ 10721) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (86/ 10721) 
her house in india is like this mansion and they have servants there i mean it is really impressive just the houses are just worth more so you can not get as much house here but yeah everybody is doing well 

Recording: (87/ 10721) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (88/ 10721) 
mbc 뉴스 김지경입니다 

Recording: (89/ 10721) 
that is fine 

Recording: (90/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (91/ 10721) 
not as an individual well i say that is a problem it is hard to find a balance between censorship and free flow of information and as long as people i mean some people like this information jerry springer is still running i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while it is kind of interesting to watch these people but 

Recording: (92/ 10721) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (93/ 10721) 
but the more time i have offering no 

Recording: (94/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 10721) 
yeah it was not there we go 

Recording: (96/ 10721) 
but you do not really have to work as hard there apparently 

Recording: (97/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (98/ 10721) 
i think you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate concentrate they look at it like well my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it they look at it like it is a big pain because i have got to run over to the nurse and 

Recording: (99/ 10721) 
you do not use coupons 

Recording: (100/ 10721) 
and apparently that is a way of initiating a conversation one of the guys i usually go clubbing with he is the one who got me into the low stick dancing and he said there is like a sign that says come hit on me does it bother you at all if they start getting really pushy about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is really funny because i will get in a conversation with them and they will be like you are straight are not you i am like yeah 

Recording: (101/ 10721) 
and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were iming each other and he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about you know talk about not liking i believe and i told him i said i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the 

Recording: (102/ 10721) 
i blew a disc out 

Recording: (103/ 10721) 
oh not very right and the first 20 years i worked at the bureau i worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they are misinterpreted and my wife has been the director of institutional research at the university data research they do not really have other kinds of research there 

Recording: (104/ 10721) 
like not go out pretty much your tv is your entertainment for the year 

Recording: (105/ 10721) 
that it is still really going on you know and his parents accepted him 

Recording: (106/ 10721) 
they were not being represented i do not know i will have to read i did not read the paper yet 

Recording: (107/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (108/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (109/ 10721) 
and yeah yeah i should not have done that so now let us just go get some more furniture 

Recording: (110/ 10721) 
i am not sure it is usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i do not know 

Recording: (111/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (112/ 10721) 
go ahead and say well now sometimes she will ask sometimes she does but let us assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and so forth she puts them right in there in that sink with those other dishes makes no efforts to clean them and i have seen this in many many many incidents but i am giving you this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today 

Recording: (113/ 10721) 
i was thinking of grandchildren 

Recording: (114/ 10721) 
i think he is in prison and he has no driver is license privileges for life it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff 

Recording: (115/ 10721) 
every time i found myself it goes up it is a nice feature sorry i will stop go ahead it does not matter when i clear my throat and you are listening to it it is going to be annoying as hell yeah my apologies in advance 

Recording: (116/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (117/ 10721) 
which are children of light 

Recording: (118/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (119/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (120/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (121/ 10721) 
i try to be as much as possible too i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (122/ 10721) 
ha 

Recording: (123/ 10721) 
but you know that there and goes back to you know the quality of the quantity i mean obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs and a basement to figure out some way of reaching his nirvana or whatever you know and his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care 

Recording: (124/ 10721) 
again gets back to the 10 tithing and i think there is something else in the bible where the lady gives only a small portion of the portion compared to large portion but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need to promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialize we need to think more of that but i think really take a whole night what would you be doing if you were a third world country and did not have a choice 

Recording: (125/ 10721) 
oh well 

Recording: (126/ 10721) 
not right now i am kind of job motivated 

Recording: (127/ 10721) 
status symbol 

Recording: (128/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (129/ 10721) 
yeah but 50 years ago if you had epilepsy they would lock you in a closet and throw away the key and would not let you out most of the parents i have seen to me i would rather see the kids with a stepparent 

Recording: (130/ 10721) 
eh it was not anything too huge i think it had about 1200 people in it or so 

Recording: (131/ 10721) 
you do too 

Recording: (132/ 10721) 
it is more of it tends to be more of entertainment i do not remember that being that way 30 years ago but it does now 

Recording: (133/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (134/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (135/ 10721) 
i think it is like there is like a real like either it is old people who are there retiring or whatever or it is more of like a younger people there i do not know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middleaged people there but it is not so apparent it is here i guess 

Recording: (136/ 10721) 
and i think there was an article this last wednesday in the dispatch and business section as to how the puco can not regulate it and because of that they want to deregulate telecommunications and so for the past months we have not been getting telephone bills for usage we have the backbone we are paying for and what is going to happen out of this whole thing is it offers us a lot of latitude where we can now if we have a contractor let us say over 

Recording: (137/ 10721) 
my personal belief is that they should be allowed to because i believe they should have the male gender as well as the female gender for a proper bringing of them 

Recording: (138/ 10721) 
does not bother me at all 

Recording: (139/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (140/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (141/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (142/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (143/ 10721) 
i mean that probably could not be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i would just bet you a million dollars know it would be the influence of tv you know and then another thing that is well tv is where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now 

Recording: (144/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (145/ 10721) 
almost poverty and the classes in our society that is just life we are always going to be that but the thing is try to have understanding and compassion for them and try to reach out and sometimes people do not want it either and sometimes you see well now i know why you do not want it because they do not know they do not know how to handle it they appreciate the thought 

Recording: (146/ 10721) 
pots never been associated with any kind of a crime that were some violent crime 

Recording: (147/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (148/ 10721) 
and there was a lot of alcoholics in the military when i was in there 

Recording: (149/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (150/ 10721)

Recording: (153/ 10721) 
my mom teaches there so it is free tuition i get a tuition waiver 

Recording: (154/ 10721)

i have a friend in new jersey or two friends a married couple she is a lifelong democrat he is been a lifelong republican and there is always interesting discussions when i go to visit and i went to visit them a few weeks before clinton was formally impeached last year and i just decided i was not going to bring it up 

Recording: (160/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (161/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (162/ 10721) 
yeah and i had the prerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money but the bad part was as the university is trying to do away with civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raises and everything so at least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have none nothing 

Recording: (163/ 10721) 
now 

Recording: (164/ 10721) 
if you have to come back to this weather i would do i would is it really

um we went to the zoo we go to the playground take my dog to the playground we will go shopping grocery shopping 

Recording: (166/ 10721)

Recording: (167/ 10721) 
which was a going thing 

Recording: (168/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (169/ 10721) 
i was reading a thing though and you say i think was yesterday where your minority and your your majority you know it is always been that you know they were trying to make it seem like it is different it is always like like the army has always been 40 minority and 60 or something like that you know you know the air force has always been like 7030 or something like that you know because the standards are a little bit higher to get in and a lot of people do not want to get into that 

Recording: (170/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (171/ 10721) 
something else in the news that said you know across the board we do not even break even we are like negative one or something 

Recording: (172/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (173/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (174/ 10721) 
about it 

Recording: (175/ 10721)

Recording: (177/ 10721) 
so he is learning about the computer now it is going to be kind of a hobby type thing at least it is not a work thing but i know we can do a lot of things for our house 

Recording: (178/ 10721) 
and like even the people the maybe their apartments did not look as impressive but they were making money 

Recording: (179/ 10721) 
i think it gave her the i am not saying i never got mad but i have gotten mad at devon quite a few times you know because i did not like some of the things that she would either say or that she would do but i try to let her live her life nobody can teach you anything unless you learn it 

Recording: (180/ 10721) 
in your room it is just like 40 of any other kind it is plenty 

Recording: (181/ 10721)

transit authority 

Recording: (183/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (184/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (185/ 10721) 
but the federal government and their lawyers have done that and the department of the interior still considers native americans on the same level as a dog they do not have rights there is something wrong there and that still goes on today after about 600 years and we got good people in this country that want to do something about it but unfortunately you know what i am finding you got everybody is got to choose their path 

Recording: (186/ 10721) 
i mean where do you draw the line where people should see and not see i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i can see something or time me what my kids can see that is my job and if i do not want to see something on tv i will turn it off if i do not want my kids to see something on tv we will have an argument it used to be easy when they were little 

Recording: (187/ 10721) 
he cleans the toilet too because he is a boy and boys even some men do not quite

Recording: (202/ 10721) 
this has a set up where they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (203/ 10721) 
i mean you do not know anything behind it or what is going into it why would you do something like that 

Recording: (204/ 10721) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (205/ 10721) 
so we had a lot of time together and she said she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (206/ 10721) 
laughs 

Recording: (207/ 10721) 
the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the greatgrandparents i am going to give you a firsthand example i just had a conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now 20 she will come over to my house grandpa is house and and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it 

Recording: (208/ 10721)

Recording: (209/ 10721) 
oh blue eyes that is right 

Recording: (210/ 10721) 
where

for their behavior because if they were an asshole before their brain injury they are going to be an asshole after their brain injury five times 

Recording: (212/ 10721) 
we never used the word ever but i am sure playing people people use the word on us you know but we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true sharing 

Recording: (213/ 10721) 
oh yeah we are members of their 

Recording: (214/ 10721) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (215/ 10721) 
nothing about it or if they did they did not even think anything about it and i do not think that behavior is appropriate for a 16 17 year old kid hmm 

Recording: (216/ 10721) 
that is a little hard to accept you know it is hard to know what he is going through how much of it is normal teenage rebellion and how much of it is just 

Recording: (217/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (218/ 10721) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (219/ 10721) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they obviously they are gonna get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parents thought i mean there are a lot of people i mean i think just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting that happened a couple years ago and they just came to a verdict on it and the parent left it in the top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on a ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it 

Recording: (220/ 10721) 
it took us 10 years to have and i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the sublateral tones undertones you know is she or is not she i was just like well i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that was a no no to her but i was not but you need to know that

so they get more buying power if they go there okay 

Recording: (222/ 10721) 
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now and then i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to the catholic church for example they can put all you can get folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on a thing to make get more attracted and they do every religion makes it more attractive for it oh it is usually more comfortable oh yeah but the bottom line is

Recording: (426/ 10721) 
mmhmm very much so 

Recording: (427/ 10721) 
so it is like you have these two different camps the camp that gets enthusiastic and that is where i was and then there is the other camp and i am sure they have their own hierarchy their whole structure and like you know they do things their way 

Recording: (428/ 10721) 
yeah it was like freshman or sophomore year 

Recording: (429/ 10721) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (430/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (431/ 10721) 
think they are screwed up anyway and they are just like well hey you know i can do that and i will be on the yeah i do i think that is a big part of that because they want their name known and they do not care if they die anyway mmhmm mmhmm 

Recording: (432/ 10721) 
pretty much yeah easy come easy go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever 

Recording: (433/ 10721) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay okay were they gay before but they did like women 

Recording: (434/ 10721) 
yeah that is one of the 

Recording: (435/ 10721) 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it is not just ohio state it would be anywhere you go you know it is just like i said you get excuse me you get assholes in 

Recording: (436/ 10721) 
that i do not understand is with the construction they start everywhere you know you think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they would work real fast and get that done and then they would move on but it is like every single place in the city is got like four guys working and you think what the hell are you doing over there 

Recording: (437/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (438/ 10721)

nah 

Recording: (442/ 10721) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many unwanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country we are a lot more rightwing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (443/ 10721) 
i just was going down like

Recording: (446/ 10721) 
we are far less agriculturally related we are more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation a woman can do most of the work that is being done outside of the home today versus what they could do have done as agricultural people and so once again though that would bring people back 

Recording: (447/ 10721) 
walks away 

Recording: (448/ 10721) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least it lets us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that as you increase your knowledge you are far better off than just saying this little hole over here this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (449/ 10721) 
i checked my fax machine the next day and it says my mother has decided to accept your offer and i thought oh shit i do not want this what am i going to do now so i ended up talking to him and i just explained to him that he had caught me off guard and that i would had more time to reconsider it and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said at that point like the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me he was a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it

Recording: (451/ 10721) 
overpowerful as far as the number of guys being out there they are violent i mean it is something that unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (452/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (453/ 10721) 
your mind you got to have your mind open to receive what your eyes and ears are you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school but there is a lot of things you are just not going to learn except by actual experience and living life and i believe that that is a lot of right there because i know i started to say well you know i do not think i finished it i myself have these once getting only what i need versus 

Recording: (454/ 10721) 
my sister is last name is goodnight and when she had her first little girl she said she was going to name her dawn ann goodnight but she did not she did not

Recording: (460/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (461/ 10721)

Recording: (462/ 10721) 
right but during the rest of the year a lot of times we will play really challenging and interesting band music and you do not always get the opportunity to do that in musical groups sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of what they expect the audience to do to want to hear

Recording: (478/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (479/ 10721)

Recording: (506/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (507/ 10721) 
so that is where he is always parked 

Recording: (508/ 10721) 
i think in the case of tie it should be used but if there is a black woman who is very well qualified for a job and a white male who is equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it 

Recording: (509/ 10721) 
yeah and geometry and trig and calculus and physics and a little smattering of everything and i bet i could not pass the i bet i could not pass the math without some instruction but my son did not pass the writing part he passed everything but the writing part writing part they ask you to write two five paragraph essays and they give you these topics and you can pick from them and you have to do it right there and

Recording: (517/ 10721) 
girlfriend works for hell also known as ameritech 

Recording: (518/ 10721) 
they go out there and there was a i suppose it was a county seat town and they file a claim on a certain area of the county land it was surveyed off and marked off in sections a section of land is 640 acres that sounds like a lot of it is a good sized area 

Recording: (519/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (520/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (521/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (522/ 10721) 
oh yeah sure 

Recording: (523/ 10721) 
and i think that the morals being especially at a young age abstinence is the best policy think they are turning to they are not going to have anything do anything before they are married but in today is life once you get into college and stuff it is a little hard to but i think a lot more kids are going that route because my parents never talked to me about sex we all learned it from our friends 

Recording: (524/ 10721) 
are they really 

Recording: (525/ 10721) 
but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (526/ 10721) 
the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so 

Recording: (527/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (528/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (529/ 10721) 
i think it was a nice thing about what we had we had grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made it a part that we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time emphasize the fact that kids want to do certain things they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to 

Recording: (530/ 10721) 
what department 

Recording: (531/ 10721) 
you know about $70000 and it was just a hard decision to make you know because i felt you know a lot of pressure i mean i am joking around you know i saw the adam sandler movie big daddy he got his foot run over by a cab and there was a lot of blood line in there pardon me where he says well i got my foot run over by a cab and that cab was huge and a jury decided that 

Recording: (532/ 10721) 
i do not think it is really affected me obviously there is more places to go shopping or to eat or there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for but i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you went to school with the people at least once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (533/ 10721) 
well i think sometimes it is because a child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never told of my kids not to do something that i myself was doing example smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner they know you are not old enough but i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age that somebody can not at another age possibly like go out on a date for example well he is going 

Recording: (534/ 10721) 
i think that is i guess i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be coming back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis 

Recording: (535/ 10721) 
das ist gut 

Recording: (536/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (537/ 10721) 
but at the same time i do not dislike them or anything for it i mean it is their choice i mean the fact of the matter is it does not have any effect or anything on my life so 

Recording: (538/ 10721) 
once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (539/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (540/ 10721) 
it would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving first of all how much are they earning how much they expect to pay for a house and all these other things they say to you well i will say 10 church then you got all 

Recording: (541/ 10721)

i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is going through you know i have went through that where you look at a woman and she is attractive to you but that is just something that is going through your mind and i think it is like the devil getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would just tell him that is something he is going through and 

Recording: (552/ 10721)

as it turned out he expected us to play the solos but we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and i thought it came out pretty well having recorded it recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset 

Recording: (563/ 10721) 
i think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and look all over the place for different plays you look on the screen it is different you say well i would have done this and this and this but down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this 

Recording: (564/ 10721) 
and they have excellent 

Recording: (565/ 10721) 
i just actually i was going to send my son to a christian kindergarten but i decided to homeschool instead so i have been homeschooling him for kindergarten 

Recording: (566/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (567/ 10721) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (568/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (569/ 10721) 
yeah right yeah we could put a little trailer there we would be outside most of the time anyway 

Recording: (570/ 10721) 
people that lived there we have got the indian department stores right down there on high street and a couple of asian groceries i do not know where they live i mean it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i do not know 

Recording: (571/ 10721) 
i did my bitching but it really was not nothing to do about it because once they have their word in it they are 

Recording: (572/ 10721) 
that is not my favorite age i guess 

Recording: (573/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (574/ 10721) 
i was taking like 21 to 23 hours a quarter 

Recording: (575/ 10721) 
and they do not know any different 

Recording: (576/ 10721) 
mmhmm i did 

Recording: (577/ 10721) 
yeah they are okay they are parents they are in their 70s now i take what i need and leave the rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (578/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (579/ 10721) 
yeah it is really expensive but that is why i went there for now i would not go there it was actually my last choice for universities but i went there because the price 

Recording: (580/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (581/ 10721) 
i think for me personally i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as coordinating things i know that sounds kind of patty i mean i do not think it is bad but i think that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (582/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (583/ 10721) 
yeah happy and you know cup your hands 

Recording: (584/ 10721) 
my son when he was in high school had a little girlfriend he was 10th grade and she was ninth grade i guess she had a baby i believe my son was in 11th grade when that baby was born and she had a lot of problems running away from home 

Recording: (585/ 10721) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (586/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (587/ 10721) 
oh exactly i am planning on just staying in the house if i can or what not oh yeah yeah i know i mean we are gonna get some water and what not because you do not know people might turn things off like you said 

Recording: (588/ 10721) 
but people coming from other cities like chicago new york and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not like that you know we only had one racial incident when i was in the service where it was we were predominantly white platoon and because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so 

Recording: (589/ 10721) 
he likes meat too 

Recording: (590/ 10721) 
yeah i think mostly they did i was kind of surprised which class was this i think this was in that introduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty you know at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at the school before my class and i was giving her a b and she was her 

Recording: (591/ 10721) 
for fun we have been playing a lot of pool 

Recording: (592/ 10721) 
neither one of us can remember it so i do not know 

Recording: (593/ 10721) 
because they have done away with civil service step raises which were wrong because i could have done a crummy job and got the same raises doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that but you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (594/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (595/ 10721) 
oh my god 

Recording: (596/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (597/ 10721) 
so i just you know it was something i was a little familiar with anyway and i was just looking for something parttime 

Recording: (598/ 10721) 
as long as you i already knew i was gonna be getting a notice so because i flunked out like in december you know and so in january i would already contacted the navy and the air force about getting into they were taking their tests and everything taking their physicals so you 

Recording: (599/ 10721) 
well i grew up with just my mom she had four kids and i was very quiet and did very well in school 

Recording: (600/ 10721) 
and neither one of these folks could answer yes or no it was healthcare for livein partners it is a simple question yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that you know and i know that from a pr standpoint you do not want to shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like that 

Recording: (601/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (602/ 10721) 
trash is picking up what movies are playing but i do not really rely on heavenly for news 

Recording: (603/ 10721) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (604/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (605/ 10721) 
yes it is definitely having an effect on children and the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet they will be able to pick up enough by changing the way they teach and so on in the next 20 years i do not know but i am glad my my children went to school when they did and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (606/ 10721) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (607/ 10721) 
i talk to her every day 

Recording: (608/ 10721) 
right my husband drops them off and i pick them up so he is there for the shortest amount of time 

Recording: (609/ 10721) 
yeah and we are one of them texas is supporting strong they have like 

Recording: (610/ 10721) 
more respectfully that to you know i mean most the people will accept you if you are dressed in a dress whereas i mean even if person in a nose ring will respect you but then you are at a disadvantage if you do not dress in a certain way 

Recording: (611/ 10721) 
put my hand here try to keep it out of the line of the wire 

Recording: (612/ 10721) 
i am impressed i am like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look like anything 

Recording: (613/ 10721) 
so if i spend time away from cher i become unpopular 

Recording: (614/ 10721) 
the i do not know why but we have got four guys in the class that is okay that is divorce that is our attitude 

Recording: (615/ 10721) 
like and the of is all those little words you are already supposed to know those you are supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it is just a little short sentence like my name is joanne i live at blah blah blah street i mean it is incredible it is like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down 

Recording: (616/ 10721) 
you got bears 

Recording: (617/ 10721) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so i am working for a research firm just for the convenience convenience of the hours i want to go back into the nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eighthour shift and i do not think that we are ready for that yet he is a good man 

Recording: (618/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (619/ 10721) 
that and i imagine that is about half and half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is ever in evolution at this time tell you the truth what is going to cause the world to end i think what they really mean by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content 감사합니다 

Recording: (620/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (621/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (622/ 10721) 
like a little coffee shop 

Recording: (623/ 10721) 
i am just kind of appalled at what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (624/ 10721) 
but even so we were on this and the germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us we did not go out in the daylight hardly at all 

Recording: (625/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (626/ 10721) 
so hard every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an f my oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there and once she got into it she went oh maybe not so i said well whatever so then she wanted to go to because it is basically a columbus public school that is geared to college only i mean if you are not going to college do not go there because you will flunk out it is very hard 

Recording: (627/ 10721) 
and i am meeting with someone on thursday actually who is in that field and it is really just an open field 

Recording: (628/ 10721) 
that would just send me into the new millennium or whatever you want to call it 

Recording: (629/ 10721) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or you know something like that you call the contractor i will be in thursday you know if you are air conditioned so they are always going to have to have people here so i just feel they are either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have 20 people that half of know what is going on and half do not but that is tough to do when you are starting people at $8 an hour and stuff so there is wendy is mcdonald is there is places that you can make that money 

Recording: (630/ 10721) 
well the first thing is clintonville 

Recording: (631/ 10721) 
oh really no they do not have like your basic amenities really uhhuh it is got a wonderful atmosphere it is a really cool place we will go back there sometime 

Recording: (632/ 10721) 
i mean i liked earl bruce and i waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was the nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that when they fired him the day before for the michigan game for having a 93 season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (633/ 10721) 
yeah no 

Recording: (634/ 10721) 
parties did not change at all 

Recording: (635/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (636/ 10721) 
gave me these leading questions i said ah i know where you are coming from i have been confronted with that when i was ohio state and so forth and so i just laid it on the line to and 

Recording: (637/ 10721) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (638/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (639/ 10721) 
i have gone to one but i had a back problem that is how i dealt with it and it worked 

Recording: (640/ 10721) 
yeah high school a lot of people are really narrowminded and work on really trying to fit in in college people are more openminded openminded and they are more willing to express their own ideas 

Recording: (641/ 10721) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (642/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (643/ 10721) 
it is a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (644/ 10721) 
be back although now i miss london 

Recording: (645/ 10721) 
and then there is somebody is house on three acres of land or something 

Recording: (646/ 10721) 
what are you doing 

Recording: (647/ 10721) 
the one that is 18 now i thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four because his dad is left handed my sister is left handed i have one left handed parent well all of a sudden in one day picked up a thing with the right hand and he is been with his right hand ever since so you really can not tell because they are pretty much either or until they were about five 

Recording: (648/ 10721) 
yeah which is good for me because i do not ever go there anyway 

Recording: (649/ 10721) 
i have a decoder card what it does is it decodes the dvd right away rather than sending it through the processor it is a lot faster it does not depend on my processor time like the movie does not skip or anything it just goes straight through so what do you do do you have meetings and then talk about computer stuff you 

Recording: (650/ 10721) 
but it is another thing that they are in their own in the house where the parents are every night and not going into the garage and finding things 

Recording: (651/ 10721) 
then while she was out there she met a cowboy who was also from ohio they were married while they were out there i guess as my son used to say she was a piece of work 

Recording: (652/ 10721) 
cause you gotta trust the people you are around you do not really wanna piss them off 

Recording: (653/ 10721) 
so they are kind of spread out 25 25 10 is kind of how it is divided out between the projects 

Recording: (654/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (655/ 10721) 
going to jump up and start hollering about my faith and i will not walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i do not feel i am ready to do that yet i think there is a place and a time for doing certain things and this is one of the biggest things that people use as a reason for faith 

Recording: (656/ 10721) 
i do not think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it is just too long people start tuning out and there is only so much you can say and it is like the candidates 

Recording: (657/ 10721) 
yeah you may be right could be could be 

Recording: (658/ 10721) 
that is the optimism yeah ok i have now dover and ferry what else do i need to remember 

Recording: (659/ 10721) 
not at all 

Recording: (660/ 10721) 
yeah i think it is of course we were fiddling with that so much 

Recording: (661/ 10721) 
i was born in columbus i am 27 graduated from ohio state 

Recording: (662/ 10721) 
aids being one of them 

Recording: (663/ 10721) 
she would pamper the kids and well from where we lived we lived just all i do not know whether you are acquainted with north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfares and we lived about a block and a half off of indianola and then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drugstore and a barber shop 

Recording: (664/ 10721) 
give us a jab sure 

Recording: (665/ 10721) 
you can do for them and that all applies to the polaris question as i see it and i think also that it is a very very major financial gain for the developers who are doing it and it is going to therefore harm the many many areas that it affected such as north north north north north what is the name of the shop north what northland like 

Recording: (666/ 10721) 
make their job earlier and faster libraries like so many other places especially universities are facing budget problems and subscriptions for periodicals are just outrageous 

Recording: (667/ 10721) 
with my mother 

Recording: (668/ 10721) 
i got a really high iq extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intellect i would go in take an exam bing bang go out get an a i would not even study for it i think i studied it as much my senior year as i did my freshman year for one midterm or one final and that just did not work when i got to college but i did not know that until i was done with my freshman with a 17 gpa about let us say the middle of winter quarter i 

Recording: (669/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (670/ 10721) 
and apparently when you are a car they have a very very zero tolerance 

Recording: (671/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (672/ 10721) 
getting them someplace stable 

Recording: (673/ 10721) 
uh spiky skill almost five years couple months 

Recording: (674/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (675/ 10721) 
there were six of us born out there 

Recording: (676/ 10721) 
yeah but i mean a kid that might want to save up for something when he is 12 years old has no chance at all of getting a job 

Recording: (677/ 10721) 
i was interested in going out to california and i have been out there several times but it was supposed to be tight why was not i interested in moving out with my mother 

Recording: (678/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (679/ 10721) 
yeah because they are more you always hear about my black ass my you know what i mean stuff like this i could give a shit 

Recording: (680/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (681/ 10721) 
yeah i hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter 

Recording: (682/ 10721) 
uh huh 

Recording: (683/ 10721) 
when they drove by us 

Recording: (684/ 10721) 
she said you know what they say now and i raised my hand and said sixth she said fourth 

Recording: (685/ 10721) 
mm 

Recording: (686/ 10721) 
in general i think the united states has a fairly welldeveloped class not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (687/ 10721) 
and the house smells wonderful it is like birthday cakes i think my wife is was the last one i make her one and we trade off a betty crocker at oddlots it was 22 cents the icing was 22 cents i made it and everybody goes this is really good it is like a sour cream icing and they go boy this is really good they go did you buy this and i go no i made it and they go really and i go yeah it cost me 44 cents 

Recording: (688/ 10721) 
and so 

Recording: (689/ 10721) 
that is really hard to say if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran negatives do not work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in columbus what plays in the state and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovich is campaign and betty montgomery is campaign campaign and that negative stuff works statewide it does not work so well in columbus i think even a younger woman 

Recording: (690/ 10721) 
lol 

Recording: (691/ 10721) 
so it is like in the parks you know like in grand canyon you can feed them you know like junk food and mcdonald is 

Recording: (692/ 10721) 
we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better match for him and then my daughter went to school it was just easier to take him to the same school and that goes back to another thing i wanted to say about why the discipline and behavior may be different in the catholic school is you are paying big bucks you know it is $4500 a year for us to send her to school you 

Recording: (693/ 10721) 
just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness forgiveness is granted whatever 

Recording: (694/ 10721) 
i you have to go for things to be considered a problem of something coming up again i mean as long as he is not did not have any history of being like an addicted user or anything like that i mean i can not say it really bothers me too much 

Recording: (695/ 10721) 
see that is how my husband was he did not have a pet growing up 

Recording: (696/ 10721) 
i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it we are very strict as far as what gets done games they have it is so wild when we were kids cowboy and indians everybody had guns if you had the best death act you were the best you know and nowadays oh do not let him have a gun you know do not let him play with the you know even a squirt gun you know and so you wonder 

Recording: (697/ 10721) 
actually being able to resend the funding but still i mean it is a we do not like to think about these things happening 

Recording: (698/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (699/ 10721) 
yeah and i get to argue about stuff there here i am just kind of sitting around 

Recording: (700/ 10721) 
yeah and there is a certain amount of gun laws that i actually did not get into until i saw that in ohio it is with a long gun or a handgun you have to be 18 but other places like texas there is no minimum age on owning a rifle or a handgun and you are looking 

Recording: (701/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (702/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (703/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (704/ 10721) 
no i do not i just got too expensive 

Recording: (705/ 10721) 
it is wild it just seems like the music has not gone anywhere because they keep going back to the 70 is the rolling stones go touring or pink floyd these are groups from back then where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people they are not there you know and the quality of the music just must not be there my daughter is into the britney spears and the backstreet boys nsync all of a sudden now we are starting to get into some of that that is starting to get 

Recording: (706/ 10721) 
ha ha 

Recording: (707/ 10721) 
what you are doing as opposed to just like some kid in his class you know 

Recording: (708/ 10721) 
vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in 92 and again in 96 and i think that is going to happen again because the candidates and i am telling you my politics here very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice and i think 

Recording: (709/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (710/ 10721) 
so this is my first time like a doggie so 

Recording: (711/ 10721) 
kind of i mean it was something i was really into until i do not know maybe about fourth or fifth grade grade at which point things sort of switched to you know like i do not know like killer robots or something like transformers that kind of thing in high school i i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys i am like star wars is fun i am gonna watch star wars more often i had them on tape 

Recording: (712/ 10721) 
i think it would be hard to get people enthusiastic for him 

Recording: (713/ 10721) 
well the charge was cutting class yeah and what it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought a note got to excuse slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you not a teacher but an administrator excuse me and she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole 30 minute 

Recording: (714/ 10721) 
like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them have bad manners at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrong kids and you want them to behave well that is how i see america america now and america has become more centrist and when it deviates from that either way that is when people become upset i remember when who was the other president that i voted for that won carter black lives 

Recording: (715/ 10721) 
well it is kind of hard see he is got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together that he does not see at all 

Recording: (716/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (717/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (718/ 10721) 
essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about 730 we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we would heard from him and got a message that my motherinlaw had fallen and she was in an emergency room the same hospital fortunately down there then on the way home i got a phone call on the cell phone from the hospital that my fatherinlaw had had some 

Recording: (719/ 10721) 
i do not have money and when i start dating people i have extremely expensive tastes for women i like wine and dining people i love the opera and that gets real expensive after a while it gets real expensive after a while i am taking one class an accounting class i had a real big mess academically i graduated high school with a 35 it was all college prep classes ap courses 

Recording: (720/ 10721) 
so when they built the continent up on 161 it was almost all gay german village was almost all gay at one time yeah there is a big gay you got what about 20 gay bars probably here in columbus alone 

Recording: (721/ 10721) 
yeah i mean it is i think it is tough and i think it is really an individual basis but i would say that there is a lot of other things that are that would contribute more to any societal problems than divorce i really do not think that that would be the main 

Recording: (722/ 10721) 
psychologist so took a long time to get to that point but so we have been talking to the psychologist about it he said most people that raise in that background he said they go different ways one is they just fall into the same pattern as their parents or they are a survivor and she appears to be a survivor she is never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us which i am glad you 

Recording: (723/ 10721) 
and they are not accurate 

Recording: (724/ 10721) 
yeah you 

Recording: (725/ 10721) 
yeah it is 70 years old 

Recording: (726/ 10721) 
i am not really a big fan i think one of the big problems is going to be initially just the the monetary thing of it you know the people that supported the basically supported the minor league teams that they had here you know like blue collar people with it you can go for 20 30 bucks and have a good time get drunk throw a beer and up there you know you are not going to be able to do that 

Recording: (727/ 10721) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like that is a real strong 

Recording: (728/ 10721)

Recording: (801/ 10721) 
i am just saying the honors would be better just because of the smaller class size i have like 400 in my class right now

does not show any knowledge or respect to the animal 

Recording: (826/ 10721) 
i love that 

Recording: (827/ 10721) 
why really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married married are staying married because those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and if they separate so what and i i think that 

Recording: (828/ 10721) 
can not focus or can not attend to anything but what is really happening is they attend to everything 

Recording: (829/ 10721) 
i wish i would these guys going to military school and so forth you know they have had problems before somewhere along the line whether it is academics or social are you ready to take on this additional responsibility no but we do not promote it again we have academics for the university oh you are going to be a sport athlete oh then we got a different standard here i am sure they do 

Recording: (830/ 10721)

the three rs you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (832/ 10721) 
not willing to pay a lot of these people they think contracting is the way but you are always going to have to have people here because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (833/ 10721) 
yeah

Recording: (838/ 10721) 
like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about our quality they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it 

Recording: (839/ 10721) 
yes for attention and yeah 

Recording: (840/ 10721) 
there is no doubt in my mind that he heard those voices now whether they were actual audible voices or whether they were voices from the inside line 

Recording: (841/ 10721) 
cry 

Recording: (842/ 10721)

Recording: (845/ 10721) 
yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good 

Recording: (846/ 10721) 
or they do not really give a damn that is the thing i have got some friends with kids and i see it like on the bus or with you know when you are working somewhere and the way people treat their kids 

Recording: (847/ 10721) 
i do not remember that at all i know how to do it but i am not sure who taught me how to do it 

Recording: (848/ 10721) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would have voted because i did not think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either 

Recording: (849/ 10721) 
no ands ifs or buts you go to jail for three years 

Recording: (850/ 10721) 
not necessarily the catholic beliefs 

Recording: (851/ 10721) 
and then like let us see a lot of it was i mean most of it was like prelabor and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video it was mostly like laborrelated 

Recording: (852/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (853/ 10721) 
i did not need to so i did not want to 

Recording: (854/ 10721) 
now well it is like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you go out and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that and then you have somebody else do that part but i do not do like major or gutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom kitchen and blah blah blah blah blah blah so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (855/ 10721) 
by the way

credit card 

Recording: (857/ 10721)

Recording: (858/ 10721) 
i look like a college student that would go here so i have never had a problem so we go and do that and like we are planning a road trip we have not decided we are thinking atlantic city or florida or new york city or new orleans those are the choices and we are trying to narrow it down 

Recording: (859/ 10721) 
that is really true 

Recording: (860/ 10721) 
thing 

Recording: (861/ 10721) 
i am a senior and i just started my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (862/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (863/ 10721) 
two of the numbers she says that herself einstein did not learn to read until he was 12 winston churchill he stuttered until he was like 7 or 8 walt disney was told by a manager at woolworths that he would never have a creative idea in his life

the core is 

Recording: (866/ 10721) 
no you know i should i really should i do that with the dog without even realizing it but i have not just because i have ran for so many years or jogged excuse me i do not run i am too slow get the correct terminology there yeah 

Recording: (867/ 10721) 
why are you doing it now but and then my youngest one she likes to dress totally different she is sort of like a little bit of a preppy but she does not understand why people want to have like eyes out on their shirt or you know a name on their pants and she says i just think that is stupid she says you can buy nice clothes without that so she is neither one of her pressured me and the one thing that was really odd when they were little is we would go like to toys r us and up and down the rows and 

Recording: (868/ 10721) 
yeah they do let is see you have to complete either a thesis or a contract which consists of taking lots of honors classes 

Recording: (869/ 10721) 
and it really is not though because i think it is actually it is really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can get along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that 

Recording: (870/ 10721) 
i justi am oldfashioned but i and i can hardly conceive anyone being a genuine homosexual evidently they are but it is so against human nature i think

Recording: (876/ 10721)

Recording: (885/ 10721) 
you would run around in three pairs of sweatsuits and a vinyl jumpsuit over that under heaters 

Recording: (886/ 10721) 
and then there is columbus 

Recording: (887/ 10721)

Recording: (894/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (895/ 10721) 
nurse bringer some of the things he has on there some of the people i think they ought to arrest him for a blend of show him on tv

i have three brothers and sisters my parents are divorced i lived with my mom and those are the three over there my dad is family i have a brother and a sister over there 

Recording: (899/ 10721) 
but when it came down to it what was the protest really about i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going with this i am very cynical about the world i have inherited because i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by 50 years of international politics and propaganda 

Recording: (900/ 10721) 
so yeah 

Recording: (901/ 10721) 
sometimes she and mary had more disagreements than i ever had with her 

Recording: (902/ 10721) 
professors yeah well as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i am one of 15 siblings 

Recording: (903/ 10721) 
right well when i was taking teacher education classes here and observing classroom teachers they would always tell me you need to give a grade for class participation 

Recording: (904/ 10721) 
of and of consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not know our neighbors at all anymore the 

Recording: (905/ 10721) 
yeah well we did that too 

Recording: (906/ 10721)

Recording: (908/ 10721) 
i mean you kind of suffer your own consequences more rather than having society like yell at you for it 

Recording: (909/ 10721)

Recording: (917/ 10721) 
basically they did not legally adopt him or anything but they are the ones that he considers his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad but it is always kind of a challenge for us 

Recording: (918/ 10721) 
i went to brookhaven which is up on carl road near north le mans 

Recording: (919/ 10721) 
it does not have any words in it like exacerbate or undoubtedly i will tell you that 

Recording: (920/ 10721) 
and that was pretty done 

Recording: (921/ 10721) 
we could not have class and in addition they were like trying to tip over buses and throwing stones at them 

Recording: (922/ 10721) 
and just took it and ripped it 

Recording: (923/ 10721) 
well i work with around mostly black people and it is a weird situation i heard more prejudice than i am noticed now than when i only worked around a cup level 

Recording: (924/ 10721) 
then they killed themselves so we will never know from their end point why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you know from their parents as to how they live you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him making him do it you know 

Recording: (925/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (926/ 10721) 
leaving out stuff man

Recording: (930/ 10721) 
charges and at that time i was a little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let him out of the car i will beat his ass kov said something i will never forget he said i would but that would probably have to be my job to do if we was living like that i was like god man rodney king all over again 

Recording: (931/ 10721) 
is that right 

Recording: (932/ 10721) 
and then we would know where to shift from there to another target 

Recording: (933/ 10721) 
oh maybe i you know because i was you know i was fooling around too when i got ninth grade and i do not know i did not wear any condoms or do anything like that and i just am very lucky for never getting pregnant 

Recording: (934/ 10721)

Recording: (938/ 10721) 
i feel like i have friends and when we say oh we are going out to the bar like we all know which bar because there is only one that college students go to

well you can carry a weapon here in columbus i can carry a weapon right now as long as it is out in the open 

Recording: (941/ 10721) 
whatever you need 

Recording: (942/ 10721) 
we went back to our room and we watched a movie my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer 

Recording: (943/ 10721)

Recording: (946/ 10721) 
i was raised in the sunday school of this church up here yeah so i am a longtime member and in fact i think i may be about the longest term member of the choir right now yeah because i sang in the choir there when i was in high school back in 1970 so it is 30 years years ago yeah right 

Recording: (947/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (948/ 10721) 
yeah a lot more 

Recording: (949/ 10721) 
you would think but i do not know there has to be something the first state that does it i mean after one i am sure others would follow suit after they see the benefits benefits of it but that first one i do not know 

Recording: (950/ 10721) 
and he had the same thing happen to him he had a scholarship or are you and both of his knees were shot and everything but and he was a good ballplayer part one of the best ones i have ever seen and rivaled like a larry bird you know back in that day and everything but one heck of a nice guy you know never let it get to him 

Recording: (951/ 10721) 
leaders would meet with him once a week and then they would come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do that enough for blacks he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say to some of my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see the greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said you know that would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not what you are going to do is you are going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you are going to give people a 

Recording: (952/ 10721) 
mmm i was not there that long 

Recording: (953/ 10721) 
most of my paintings this is going to sound funny most of my paintings are of images from star wars 

Recording: (954/ 10721) 
i do not know maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be it is more like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we got to like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get 

Recording: (955/ 10721) 
so i am not going to get any fairness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me the award saying that they sided in their favor and all that crap well you know fine but i am not gonna pay them until they contact me again 

Recording: (956/ 10721) 
or had no real relevance to their lives i mean i think the kids would rally immediately the issue right now is that there is nothing there 

Recording: (957/ 10721) 
and it stays with you for years they do not realize that nobody tells them until after the fact 

Recording: (958/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (959/ 10721) 
that is it that is what i worry about the larger school systems too that is what concerns me with hilliard you get such a large variety of people compared to a lot like where i was in the smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that your parents knew their parents yeah your parents knew their parents their parents knew their parents now you know and i walk to my friend is house and half her friends if she is going over to play they got to drive them almost because they are all around 

Recording: (960/ 10721) 
and we really like her we enjoy being with her but sometimes more than being with my son 

Recording: (961/ 10721) 
really enjoy one of the things i do not like about living in the big city is is like but i have gotten used to but i do not like the fact that every time you look up in the night sky all you see is this like orange haze you can not see stars very well the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every morning at 230 in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived i lived in taylor so it is 

Recording: (962/ 10721) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together the only thing that is going to happen is it is going to trickle down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miserable and they fight and you feel like it is your fault because this happened it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult 

Recording: (963/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (964/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (965/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (966/ 10721) 
well like a million miles down to the south end or something like that but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers it is interesting to add on 

Recording: (967/ 10721) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room all to myself you know i do not want to go someplace where i am going to have to like deal with something else so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home 

Recording: (968/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (969/ 10721) 
and they should and very rarely do doctors even ask about allergies and more and more people do not even realize get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out what is wrong with them because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they have eaten 

Recording: (970/ 10721) 
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (971/ 10721) 
it was during school you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year go in the morning and your senior you go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the career center then you go 

Recording: (972/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (973/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (974/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (975/ 10721) 
oh ja 

Recording: (976/ 10721) 
the reds more so than indians back my younger days because they were not worth a damn but 

Recording: (977/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (978/ 10721) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progression that needs to be made i was just talking to someone a couple weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her actually her brother is a fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know him all that well apparently her family i mean she is double major in history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it 

Recording: (979/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (980/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (981/ 10721) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too i never did it and i wish i could have waited until i was married you know you are going through that whatever you go through when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people some kids still do that think yes i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (982/ 10721) 
oh i was going to say it would be interesting 

Recording: (983/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (984/ 10721) 
has to be a longstanding kind of thing yeah you know and that worries me more than i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gay marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either you 

Recording: (985/ 10721) 
crime is a lot worse now you know on the streets than it used to be 

Recording: (986/ 10721) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (987/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 10721) 
i mean we would be 70 years old when the kid graduates from high school and that would not be fair to the kid and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too we talked about it decided it was not a good idea 

Recording: (989/ 10721) 
et à y croire 

Recording: (990/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (991/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (992/ 10721) 
but you need to get it out of your chest 

Recording: (993/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (994/ 10721) 
and this one could die so 

Recording: (995/ 10721) 
i have to admit when we go to try to play golf sometimes and not have a tee time you can not even get in 

Recording: (996/ 10721) 
they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (997/ 10721) 
the world i have heard stories you know yeah people will pay but why but it is like yeah if you say it is true i will look into it is that okay i think that is a really good point you are going to learn it even more perfectly so it is going to be less and less englishlike 

Recording: (998/ 10721) 
with that boy 

Recording: (999/ 10721) 
that goes with the disorder they know who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (1000/ 10721) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of more tentative or they are from the south or something like that so there and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbus 

Recording: (1001/ 10721) 
yeah i did 

Recording: (1002/ 10721) 
yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (1003/ 10721) 
yeah one more thing to deal with on the other hand it beats you know growing up in 50 foster homes or an orphanage 

Recording: (1004/ 10721) 
yeah that blocks out all that extraneous stuff that is trying to pull you away 

Recording: (1005/ 10721) 
it got kind of rough to have her here for a couple three weeks out of the or a month or something like that you know during the summer 

Recording: (1006/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1007/ 10721) 
it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere and mi so they are all over they have projects all over 

Recording: (1008/ 10721) 
i do not know 

Recording: (1009/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1010/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1011/ 10721) 
i do not have a good opinion of columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1012/ 10721) 
but i am pretty involved what do you get out of the church necessarily designed as i heard this in a sermon this is really good it is not designed as the congregation comes in and says wait 

Recording: (1013/ 10721) 
yeah they are prostrike we are getting money on buck ids but you know 

Recording: (1014/ 10721)

she believes no man will love you so much not to cheat and i do not believe that so i am not with her son 

Recording: (1016/ 10721)

i grew up in columbus 

Recording: (1019/ 10721) 
yeah but you know 

Recording: (1020/ 10721) 
yeah i hope to uh at 49 you know i have learned a heck of a lot a lot of things i would not want to know you know but but i think they have been really good as long as you turn them around and make them a positive statement for you but that is why they like to have the a bookstore just down around campus you know and people can come in and go over there and relax you know 

Recording: (1021/ 10721) 
you know

Recording: (1035/ 10721) 
yeah well you are very smart you know 

Recording: (1036/ 10721) 
well there is been quite a change in the attitude of the general public i think as far as women working away from home is concerned and i do not know i am glad that my wife was able to work there at home well actually she worked in an office when our first boilie was this small 

Recording: (1037/ 10721) 
no no she has to do it it is chaos up there it is chaos i mean they had somebody come in to oversee the whole setup to see where they needed more help at whether they needed more nurses and the guy told her the person that was in charge the head nurse or whatever there is no way that person can do that job they still do it so when you are in charge it is just a nightmare you are supposed to know where every single patient is where they are charged what is going on what room they are 

Recording: (1038/ 10721) 
just my wife and i this time

Recording: (1048/ 10721) 
yeah and it is like number one in the union and that is like such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone is life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent you know 

Recording: (1049/ 10721) 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against him and that is what i want my son to keep i want him to know his father and be around him even though he is not the best of person but you know

Recording: (1057/ 10721) 
well that basically is you know as your influx of people move out of city limits and everything you know then you have got to have places for them to show up and everything and basically the northland mall is been there forever jacob who owned indians owned it he never did anything to it you know so you got your lazarus your penneys and mainstay places that generally moved there because of the 

Recording: (1058/ 10721) 
right right that is right yeah so that was an interesting and when we went to church up hamilton and over to and out by carl there is shopping center after shopping center after shopping center after housing development after but when we did that

yeah 

Recording: (1063/ 10721)

Recording: (1065/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1066/ 10721) 
hahaha 

Recording: (1067/ 10721) 
and then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure that they kept me there but i think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable i mean i do not know i have never done this before so i can not really say but i mean my feeling is the least amount of time i have to be in the hospital the happier i am gonna be

city council of dayton and had highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that they would do something along that line should have gone to columbus at the same time very interesting 

Recording: (1161/ 10721) 
i do not know i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and was doing aggression management or something like that you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe 

Recording: (1162/ 10721) 
i think it should be the parents responsibility but i have no objection to them teaching it somewhat in the schools i guess 

Recording: (1163/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1164/ 10721) 
well i mean 

Recording: (1165/ 10721)

Recording: (1168/ 10721) 
forced to take this class i think that if i i mean it is good to being forced to take a liberal arts thing because you do not know what you want to do so it is like if you hate math and you do not take it at but then you decide you want to do something in math and you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (1169/ 10721) 
you know when i hear about kids 12 13 luckily i was not that early but i think once they start you know like sixth grade they really should relate to them

Recording: (1194/ 10721) 
no no i think i am alright 

Recording: (1195/ 10721) 
and pretty much stuff like that and he would try to quote the bible and i would have a bible there with me and i would look it up and it would not be right at all 

Recording: (1196/ 10721) 
not really no 

Recording: (1197/ 10721)

Recording: (1198/ 10721) 
that is what he does he is not really interested in farming although his major pastime is going out on his tractor and mowing lawn and doing other miscellaneous things he really likes his tractors he really likes his tractors he was raised in suburbia so the tractor thing is a whole new thing for him really he really likes it he is from rochester new york yeah 

Recording: (1199/ 10721) 
i do not know she is getting a second child now it is getting a little harder 

Recording: (1200/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1201/ 10721) 
image you present that you have got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place you are going to be out of the loop and you know if people were just a little more comfortable with themselves you know and i i am a big one to talk i was like mr insecure for 30 years at least then i finally got to the point and i went to hell with it it is too much work either like me or do not if you do not go to somebody else a lot of people are really worried i do not know about boys but i know girls are really worried about what people think of them and how they look 

Recording: (1202/ 10721) 
and their needs were immediate 

Recording: (1203/ 10721) 
that is what we are and i can handle that i am not ready for that and that is crazy she is twenty three first person ever dated is older than me and uh that is just frightening and she is like dead serious she was 100 sure i was the person she was going to marry and i will see her at church every so often and she will come up and give me a big hug she is like i miss you and i am like well i miss you too not probably the way you miss me but i miss i miss you yeah she is in lunatic no no 

Recording: (1204/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1205/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1206/ 10721) 
i do not know i like the story 

Recording: (1207/ 10721) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (1208/ 10721) 
what was going on you know what i mean it is just a tragedy i had a friend when i was a kid too that we were like i do not know or something like that well it was an accidental shooting and him and another friend of mine from the same class you know he pulled a gun shot him you know i did not know the damn thing was a little bit but and they were talking about another thing about that you know we are some kiddo 

Recording: (1209/ 10721) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time and when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is exacerbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (1210/ 10721) 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there is some really really exceptional things going on 

Recording: (1211/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1212/ 10721) 
there is no faulting any of these folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative in response to say to this experience so you end up with you are kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately immediately following it nevermind pretend i never said that 

Recording: (1213/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1214/ 10721) 
in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they would not be liable 

Recording: (1215/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (1216/ 10721) 
i would get more people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i am making about 10 or 11 bucks an hour 

Recording: (1217/ 10721) 
gun control i am not really too interested in i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they are one of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they are relatively safe so i mean 

Recording: (1218/ 10721) 
that is bishop reedy it is a catholic school over on the west side 

Recording: (1219/ 10721) 
yeah which cracks me up because if you have ever looked at the parents of models they are not necessarily all that attractive yeah 

Recording: (1220/ 10721) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go 

Recording: (1221/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1222/ 10721) 
that is her job is to spoil them so the poor things have the belly hanging on the ground 

Recording: (1223/ 10721) 
you know talk to her but people do not when i was 14 i did not care what anybody told me i was going to do it no matter what 

Recording: (1224/ 10721) 
i think so 

Recording: (1225/ 10721) 
oh yeah and you know what i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook red meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups a lot of good soups for him with meat and it really does not bother me to cook it i am not going to sit home and make it roast every night 

Recording: (1226/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (1227/ 10721) 
even harder 

Recording: (1228/ 10721) 
it is just the spiritual aspect there is a realm even einstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yeah but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory 

Recording: (1229/ 10721) 
the problem is like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at 8 am well an airport has so many runways and so many taxiways and like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports they end up shooting like 30 there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there and hold while they are shooting them in what they do is they will 

Recording: (1230/ 10721) 
i talk to him every now and then 

Recording: (1231/ 10721) 
yeah that part was no different man 

Recording: (1232/ 10721) 
sort of like the definition of need versus luxury those definitions change the definition of socialism and democracy they slowly have changed over these times well the same thing will be true with those it is still functioning and i think we will also slowly swing that pendulum on back to the family again 

Recording: (1233/ 10721) 
and people do not 

Recording: (1234/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1235/ 10721) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (1236/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1237/ 10721) 
i started this school year off with 27 kindergartners and no aid 

Recording: (1238/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1239/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (1240/ 10721) 
it has a large gate it does 

Recording: (1241/ 10721) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but i do not think that you can say everything everybody has to do this because people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think 

Recording: (1242/ 10721) 
absent for the whole day which would be considered truant so they said what i had to do was go down to juvenile to the certain gentleman in juvenile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was a school should have did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son is getting ready to go to 11th grade and 

Recording: (1243/ 10721) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family in fact i have been really happy about them lately because we have lived in our same house for 20 years and my parents they live in florida i mean they are not welltodo by any means but they are not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to study 

Recording: (1244/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1245/ 10721) 
that encompasses the theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is 

Recording: (1246/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (1247/ 10721) 
it is not really an office he is like a supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he tells the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and then he gets to talk with the other contractors and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites 

Recording: (1248/ 10721) 
you know mixed race or handicapped or you know hard to place 

Recording: (1249/ 10721) 
or 

Recording: (1250/ 10721) 
at each other is throat for this that and the other and you know devin is with my daughters and when i really get put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to st louis because there probably could have been more problems legal problems you know as far as going back and forth to court and putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff you know so in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (1251/ 10721) 
and a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (1252/ 10721) 
or like the art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the irish festival in dublin which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that that the concerts on the river on the worthington green really anything like that 

Recording: (1253/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1254/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (1255/ 10721) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (1256/ 10721) 
they did not know 

Recording: (1257/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1258/ 10721) 
because i mean that must be how she raised her kids you know and she is that is what i asked her she is got a husband i am like so your husband you believe he cheats yeah i do not believe that i think that is terrible 

Recording: (1259/ 10721) 
i would not doubt it i hope they vote against it but i do not think they will 

Recording: (1260/ 10721) 
well it is kind of hard when you have got your limited choices here some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you are looking at the memorial did you watch that debate 

Recording: (1261/ 10721) 
because it stops your heart right away 

Recording: (1262/ 10721) 
they do not have that for columbus schools 

Recording: (1263/ 10721) 
yeah they will just take one scripture and they will expand it and they will just run with that one scripture and then there are also churches that will just delete in their minds they will delete certain sections of the scripture that they do not like 1 corinthians chapter 12 talks about spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and 

Recording: (1264/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1265/ 10721)

out you know and i was just brought up to be an honest person and unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they sell out their ideals and their principles for $40000 a year and then they use their family or their situation financially as an excuse to sell those ideals i 

Recording: (1432/ 10721) 
we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over a year so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hardware to install it given all the hardware stores that we have here and the ability to overnight freight things if there was any kind of special

as a teacher how could you cut down on students and say no that is not the way it was and you are learning from a teacher is guide no but how do you know about asking a person it is a matter of tradition and handing it down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way and it is not necessarily say written down but it is passed on those days probably written down or not written down but verbal and extended and so it is that hand

Recording: (1642/ 10721) 
of all the offcampus kids to the police and so they start driving around around 1030 to try and bust them for noise on the weekends so it is pretty hectic 

Recording: (1643/ 10721)

Recording: (1644/ 10721) 
they have different art classes different speech and language classes different levels of science it is kind of like a college campus

Recording: (1651/ 10721) 
yeah there can not be sanctions for doing the right thing and so i am opposed to that well yeah i guess you would have to say that i would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything in that relation that it is just that the effort should focus on getting them

mmhmm sure 

Recording: (1657/ 10721) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (1658/ 10721) 
they just need really positive things when they do go to school and i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot and i think through education because it is hard all these schools and so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then it always has to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked in all these big large classrooms it just seems to me when 

Recording: (1659/ 10721) 
he is a businessman 

Recording: (1660/ 10721) 
yeah it says 

Recording: (1661/ 10721)

Recording: (1663/ 10721) 
i am out 

Recording: (1664/ 10721) 
i got a son and then he is got a son so i guess i am a grandfather i hardly ever see him 

Recording: (1665/ 10721) 
okay that is a good job i mean because you get flex time yeah 

Recording: (1666/ 10721) 
i well that is a that is a tough one i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know where you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake and i never really thought about while i was growing up that it was what was real and everything i always knew that by i dare again you know by my dad being a 

Recording: (1667/ 10721) 
anyway he went in for less than a year i think and then he was discharged and then he was called back in sent to vietnam and it was sort of a traumatic experience for him that i think he is pretty well come out of but he was in a rear area he never was up where he was doing any shooting himself you 

Recording: (1668/ 10721) 
i do not know what kind that is because i know they have traded airplanes since i have been gone 

Recording: (1669/ 10721)

Recording: (1672/ 10721) 
on the bombs is something but to actually have that right there i mean have the access and what not i mean i guess the grandparents had the house locked and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew that how to use them and that scares me 

Recording: (1673/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1674/ 10721) 
these loose ends that they keep having i suspect they probably will not do that they will leave things openended for future tv movies or maybe another featurelength movie 

Recording: (1675/ 10721) 
he is

Recording: (1678/ 10721) 
i said there is a big 

Recording: (1679/ 10721) 
i am not giving up hope or nothing like that i am just trying to cut through and see what i can do it is very limited out there you know and your education is an asset but like i said even as a person now going through bv vr i am discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelor is in other words bureau of vocational rehabilitation 

Recording: (1680/ 10721) 
oh yeah i am oh i always wear tshirts i do not i am a tshirt person i do not like things on my arms like i got all like bracelets or anything 

Recording: (1681/ 10721) 
the part now it takes about 50 minutes but to do all this stretching 

Recording: (1682/ 10721) 
yes have not they talked about that here actually have they talked about 

Recording: (1683/ 10721) 
i am hoping that will be the same experience as it is in ohio state 

Recording: (1684/ 10721) 
and i think that sometimes they do not even count all the votes or something and sometimes if they really wanted to go through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen and somehow or other they will count it so it did or they will you know 

Recording: (1685/ 10721) 
like that like solitary but like unlimited solitary that does not seem right either 

Recording: (1686/ 10721) 
i tried volunteering you know picking them up doing a volunteer thing and i would get calls all during the night to go pick these kids up because i thought i was doing something to help but you know you are not helping them 

Recording: (1687/ 10721) 
in a fashion that makes it almost diametrically opposed to mine a great many times but at the same time the prereligion understanding of something 

Recording: (1688/ 10721) 
very much twoface the mother especially because i know she is talked about me and stuff which hurts my feelings because i am i mean i might cause them i do not cause him and when he is at their house we will get in an argument and that is what makes them not like me because of the yelling and stuff but i feel like i am not the one that makes him yell 

Recording: (1689/ 10721) 
control problems of course there is always a leak somewhere yeah well it could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that it is drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and that is why it quit damn right 

Recording: (1690/ 10721) 
but there is things that are difficult like there is that where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to fit certain criteria they have to be baptized and follow all these health codes and all the different codes but that is not what they are interested in doing and that is hard i think 

Recording: (1691/ 10721) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have the things to worry about that people do now when i was in elementary and junior high we would i never dreamed of anybody having a good gun or even let alone a knife i mean that and that is violence and that is that goes back to kids and how much time and effort you put into them kids are ignored and pushed aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and then they 

Recording: (1692/ 10721) 
yeah as i was teasing 

Recording: (1693/ 10721) 
but i do not see it as negatively affecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to get done 

Recording: (1694/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1695/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1696/ 10721) 
yeah my dad is a chauvinist pig but that is he still is 

Recording: (1697/ 10721) 
i mean it is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there you know the portions are a lot a lot it is getting worse there than it was but i mean nowhere is it anywhere near and that is a large part of the problem with the people for 

Recording: (1698/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (1699/ 10721) 
yeah okay 

Recording: (1700/ 10721) 
i thought they would be a lot better they picked up ken griffey and then on top of it they were good without him and now they picked him up and they seem to be doing it they are still struggling like i do not understand that but the indians are horrible right now i like i watched the game yesterday and they were i think they were a few days ago seven and a half games back from the chicago white sox we watched the game yesterday and i do not know if we have a lot of injuries or anything because i do not really follow the indians but 

Recording: (1701/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1702/ 10721) 
i could it might take me a year or two 

Recording: (1703/ 10721) 
oh yeah that is beautiful 

Recording: (1704/ 10721) 
so be it we had the ribbiters out there helping out the gis fine team effort was not it but then after gis came home the little a went back into the house and business saw these idle lines and said hey we can do something here because in those days a little lady said well i will go out and get a little odd job we want a little thing mom would do pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad was a primary bread winner but she got into some odd jobs just to complement their needs 

Recording: (1705/ 10721) 
there was pregnant girls in middle school 

Recording: (1706/ 10721) 
and i really fault myself for that but it is made me more aware too when you look at somebody and say oh you would never dream that they well i do you know they are in anything i do not put past anybody doing i really do not because they just yeah oh no i do because there is some good ones out there there is some bad ones too but you know 

Recording: (1707/ 10721) 
i am sure the fact that my parents my mother tries really hard but my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic he insisted he could drink on the weekends and never miss work etc yeah there was no problem but the biggest problem is the fact that he and i i have always expected to have some sort of a respect from them 

Recording: (1708/ 10721) 
that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1709/ 10721) 
you even got these what stunt guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (1710/ 10721) 
and the real meaning behind it 

Recording: (1711/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1712/ 10721) 
and basically they were three weeks long they were about four and a half hours the first one was really long you know jason was he was like i can not take this last night was not so bad the first one was a lot of information classroom kind of stuff he did real well he was much more interactive than a lot of the other guys were just kind of you know they would sit there and they were not breathing and they were kind of rolling their eyes and i just think god you bunch of bums you know it is going to come down to it 

Recording: (1713/ 10721) 
well they knew all different things i mean culturally you know it was different music of course i am in a suburban high school and since cincinnati you did not get exposed to much so that was the biggest thing well of course they talk funny in the east but other than that other than that than the culture shock it was not that different 

Recording: (1714/ 10721) 
if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but in an election sometimes a weekend is a couple of centuries a year is an eon so anything can happen between now and then i think dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate which is basically where clinton placed 

Recording: (1715/ 10721) 
because i am gay i might be interested in him that is the height of arrogance but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not but it is not a mindset i have so it is hard for me to understand 

Recording: (1716/ 10721) 
excuse me 

Recording: (1717/ 10721) 
their generation right before me so we are stuck right in the middle i do not even think we have a generation 

Recording: (1718/ 10721) 
what it was called but they kept getting these big names for things 

Recording: (1719/ 10721) 
and she is taken very good care of herself she is followed all the doctor is orders and she is very careful what she eats 

Recording: (1720/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1721/ 10721) 
right same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people had to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situations got that way but i do believe that the older people including our government people and everybody that is at the top has to set the example 

Recording: (1722/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (1723/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1724/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1725/ 10721) 
right right yeah yeah 

Recording: (1726/ 10721) 
so coleman you know you had a good record 

Recording: (1727/ 10721) 
i was ready to settle down i was not going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that and lie and cheat and make up stories and he still does it i do not and i do not understand why i feel like he is a grown man if he was out do not make up a story and his mother also make you know they are just it is just it is very for me and that is another reason why i do not want my son going there for much longer 

Recording: (1728/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1729/ 10721) 
now is when i need to be off with them where we can take them out and run 

Recording: (1730/ 10721) 
i have already learned an immense amount looking at your url thing okay so belgium is a 

Recording: (1731/ 10721) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him are two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (1732/ 10721) 
to put into it 

Recording: (1733/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1734/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (1735/ 10721) 
but they are because they are both government programs but yeah but i think like i said for the younger people because it is because it is not their fault their parents can not get health insurance healthcare 

Recording: (1736/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1737/ 10721) 
yeah i think the population in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people people in one area i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and i am more aware of what is going on and i really am going to be some kind of activist for i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things 

Recording: (1738/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1739/ 10721) 
that is just one of those myths i think that is to make people feel guilty or something 

Recording: (1740/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1741/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1742/ 10721) 
it has not gone as far as loan sharking but the thing of it is it is fun when you win and it is still fun when you lose 

Recording: (1743/ 10721) 
that is cool that is the best place where you have to actually work to get there 

Recording: (1744/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (1745/ 10721) 
just really not extraordinarily different food necessarily but just really 

Recording: (1746/ 10721) 
you know what are you going to do you hit that kid you are going to jail 

Recording: (1747/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (1748/ 10721) 
yeah i would be so frustrated i probably oh i would be really 

Recording: (1749/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (1750/ 10721) 
heard that the more conservative unitarian churches are in new england around boston where it was started and there are some that are relatively conservative there but for the most part it is what you would call liberal religion yeah are you 

Recording: (1751/ 10721) 
it is supposed to be a let me see school for art 

Recording: (1752/ 10721)

Recording: (1754/ 10721) 
that is what i was actually thinking of where he takes the pictures on the corner 

Recording: (1755/ 10721) 
not really he is come to accept it but it was her decision it is one thing to know that it is the best thing for the baby but it is another thing my wife and i are trying to deal with emotionally we are very family oriented that this is a grandchild we will never get to see seat watch grow up that is very hard on us but it is an open adoption they have met the couple several times they promised to send pictures and 

Recording: (1756/ 10721) 
uh huh 

Recording: (1757/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1758/ 10721) 
but full time i would definitely go back when he is in school 

Recording: (1759/ 10721) 
she figures well you know that kind of makes up for me not working 

Recording: (1760/ 10721) 
yeah and i am like oh this is really interesting you know and then i will drive along and people are just like ah blowing the horns and i am like well i could care less 

Recording: (1761/ 10721) 
i had french in the sixth grade and i got a is i had german and spanish in the seventh grade and then in the eighth grade i had french in the ninth grade i had french in the tenth grade i had french and my junior year of high school i had french and my grades went b is straight b is c is straight c is d is straight d is and i said i think i should get out now and i stopped taking i did not take french my senior year but then the arts and sciences came around and said you will have it for him

Recording: (1764/ 10721)

drink around the world oh boy 

Recording: (1766/ 10721) 
i want you to be a man you know play basketball 

Recording: (1767/ 10721) 
but since all the moms have gone to work and let the tv become the electronic babysitter and the other thing that is happening is kids do not know things now that you would expect them to know like because their moms are not reading to them like they do not know who winnie the pooh is 

Recording: (1768/ 10721) 
and i would not be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here 

Recording: (1769/ 10721) 
yeah i think it is further east than where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it is like the border of europe and asia 

Recording: (1770/ 10721) 
there would been a small raised place out there and what i remember about it is one morning dad went out to milk and the milk cows were out on that island 

Recording: (1771/ 10721) 
if i would grown up with them maybe they would have that thing going on that my sister has which is a bunch of shared mutual experiences but as it stands they are just weird 

Recording: (1772/ 10721) 
to i have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (1773/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (1774/ 10721) 
yeah i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that 

Recording: (1775/ 10721)

Recording: (1776/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1777/ 10721)

Recording: (1798/ 10721) 
but they kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you are not going to provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so here was a case in my opinion a very very honest politician but he was also being shoved away from what he felt was an honest approach

well i 

Recording: (1800/ 10721) 
seminaries in the us and it is a republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community so are you thinking you might move back there or are you just looking to find a place that is similar to that 

Recording: (1801/ 10721) 
it used to be you lived in a little neighborhood you knew all your neighbors you do not have that now everybody is mobile

Recording: (1805/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1806/ 10721) 
because i think it is archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and bad a school you think think you are going to if you want to do it you can because really in public schools if you have a learning disability or if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and in like worthington and westerville dublin you know they do not 

Recording: (1807/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (1808/ 10721)

Recording: (1809/ 10721) 
grandview has its own school system too 

Recording: (1810/ 10721)

Recording: (1815/ 10721) 
what his background really was 

Recording: (1816/ 10721) 
and they have met the couple that is going to adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me 

Recording: (1817/ 10721) 
and he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends we still see them a lot and we were close with their parents 

Recording: (1818/ 10721) 
his dad pays her for the babysitting because i can not afford it 

Recording: (1819/ 10721) 
uh i do not know 

Recording: (1820/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (1821/ 10721) 
i would have a hard time believing that i mean if the person knew i would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and and that was important to them and they prayed and 

Recording: (1822/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1823/ 10721) 
back then i was working at a cycle shop but i was in the service while i was working there 

Recording: (1824/ 10721) 
great guy but he sure liked to get drunk you know and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk 

Recording: (1825/ 10721) 
i can not see it 

Recording: (1826/ 10721) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (1827/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1828/ 10721) 
to stop without it and that is too bad you know that things have been that bad in some like a world war ii i mean we did not really have any choice there but some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary but you can get a philosophy but 

Recording: (1829/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (1830/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (1831/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1832/ 10721) 
and the other one is a working cuff at the steubenville ohio 

Recording: (1833/ 10721) 
where i do not think that there is any question they could look right down our throats because and anyway we fired a couple times from there they started firing back at us and man scared me 

Recording: (1834/ 10721) 
i am not sure if i am going to be able to do that of an acquaintance of mine that is kind of a headhunter and i have given him the idea that i want to either work for an attorney that is going to make some changes or do something that way i have got a lot of administration and manager and things like that background so i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also 

Recording: (1835/ 10721) 
the population is much different yes 

Recording: (1836/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1837/ 10721)

i play lottery once in a while if i have a couple bucks on me and uh well football games we will not even start with that 

Recording: (1839/ 10721) 
but there is a couple places that are just way out in the middle of nowhere and you have to take a fourwheel drive to get there 

Recording: (1840/ 10721) 
like i should have stuck in there but i could not deal with it anymore i would go home and want to cry these were all adults older than me and it was just it was really silly 

Recording: (1841/ 10721) 
even doing none of that anymore so it is very frustrating for us and the baby they are giving up for adoption so that is a whole different problem 

Recording: (1842/ 10721) 
and it was fun i met a lot of neat people in fact that is where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one of the artists who came to me but nobody was going to make any money on on it and it was the kind of thing that it was a project i started when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project and i did not know anything about it i would never i have never even been in a gallery i thought this will be fun i will just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying to think of something i could do with it 

Recording: (1843/ 10721) 
and i said no no you are not 

Recording: (1844/ 10721) 
it is open 24 hours so there is people that you know it is like shifts overlap you know it is not like everybody leaves and then everybody comes in you know it is like like when we are there like the night shift people start to come in people who work from like 8 to 4 8 8 pm to 4 am and that would be really weird i guess like nobody calls then or something like 10 people call so she is like it is easy she is like i get paid to 

Recording: (1845/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (1846/ 10721) 
and not all of them are vietnam vets either 

Recording: (1847/ 10721) 
just like almost out of control 

Recording: (1848/ 10721)

Recording: (1849/ 10721) 
oh every day every day there was something it is like i felt like i knew more about clinton is sex life than i knew about my own it was far more than i wanted to know about anybody else is whereas in the past there is been since i had a fear the press never acknowledged it even if they knew it at least that is what you know 

Recording: (1850/ 10721) 
bad they were you know they laid a hand on her of course you know but but by her being away you know then and her mom is got a cool head on her shoulder she would not let that happen unless she told me about it and she would be probably afraid to tell me that catching airplane flight down over there or something you know hook the guy up or something

Recording: (1858/ 10721) 
because like i said it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt 

Recording: (1859/ 10721) 
oh there is a lot of racism 

Recording: (1860/ 10721) 
it was well it started out as computer science under the college of arts and sciences but then there was this whole foreign language requirement and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually i became a proud member of the college of business 

Recording: (1861/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1862/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1863/ 10721) 
and then like people who work go back until like you know maybe two to six the kids are done with school for the day at like 12 or one

and they were in italy and europe and there was not the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from us probably as a consequence of our understanding of the 

Recording: (1875/ 10721) 
probably northwest area 

Recording: (1876/ 10721) 
it is like your 18monthold daughter you have to amuse them and distract them

Recording: (1889/ 10721) 
so let us say she was in a situation where she had some sort of bills to pay you know the one environment was much more closeknit i am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere somewhere along the line they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps it would not be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is that 

Recording: (1890/ 10721) 
and i was crying the whole time just that little pain my mom was laughing at me it was not funny they left out parts you know if you talk to people when they have babies and they oh it is the worst pain but you will forget about it they left out that whole part where they put the epidural you and you

Recording: (1899/ 10721) 
amazing how much the growth in delaware and different areas when i was growing up here and how marysville was such a farm town just the growth of the different cities and suburbs of columbus is amazing and the housing and 

Recording: (1900/ 10721) 
living and going to those schools because it is very expensive to live in that area so there is a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid and worthy to dublin and it is really not true it is just that you can not tell all the poor people and the people who do not have two parents do not come to school because we want our scores higher but when the news media goes look how bad brown is brown school did this year but they do not look to see like jelena they do not go well look at the scores on the california achievement test there is like 75 of the kids that are getting

she said i would talk to the devil 

Recording: (1921/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1922/ 10721) 
i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (1923/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (1924/ 10721) 
he really does not like it like how things work

Recording: (1931/ 10721) 
and the lower you are apparently the easier it is or something that was the coach is philosophy anyway 

Recording: (1932/ 10721) 
judges are bought and paid for they are elected there is a lot of crap there and i learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribes and that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are 

Recording: (1933/ 10721) 
well clown cone is not there anymore clown cone you could get a bag of tootsie rolls and pay only five cents that is gone that was a kid thing my grandfather used to own an amendment market

namaste 

Recording: (1947/ 10721)

i was in columbus for the first six years i taught 

Recording: (1951/ 10721) 
how to step by step of how to commit suicide yeah they have to be responsible i think because you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry these things out i think it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (1952/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1953/ 10721)

Recording: (2000/ 10721) 
and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are doing it so at least at the very least they might have as well be safe about it 

Recording: (2001/ 10721) 
んん

Recording: (2019/ 10721) 
i just think it is sad even here in columbus you know like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools and i thought you know i just you know it is just because of all the things you have seen in the world in the last year that these kids want to do this just to see what is going to happen 

Recording: (2020/ 10721) 
and they say that is a city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like 60000

oxlux is probably the closest place 

Recording: (2055/ 10721) 
the age 17 maybe i think they should have a parent is consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it is gonna be if she is gonna be a young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them there is so much of that for a while there that was going on and it is like i can not believe these women are doing this they just snap 

Recording: (2056/ 10721) 
it hurt too 

Recording: (2057/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (2058/ 10721) 
it is yeah 

Recording: (2059/ 10721) 
sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously england is such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me but it is true i mean the fact that he 

Recording: (2060/ 10721)

Recording: (2062/ 10721) 
boy it would have to be something that i actually enjoy what happened was ever since i came to columbus almost every company i worked for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that because my husband works for the state so obviously he is not going anywhere so i got tired that and that is why i kind of went to dumping and stuff so it would be one with variety i am unfortunately i say unfortunately good at accounting and 

Recording: (2063/ 10721) 
at our desk we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (2064/ 10721)

Recording: (2065/ 10721) 
oh you know what those areas

Recording: (2067/ 10721) 
i do not know it just seemed easier you know life was i do not know it just was not the driving is the main issue with me you know the freeways we have here were not built for the amount of people that travel on them now i remember when they built 71 north i remember when they built 70 east there were no freeways i remember going up 315 when they first opened it and it was like nobody was on it you could just drive on it it was like an empty road 

Recording: (2068/ 10721) 
and then i was in tennessee for i do not know a year 

Recording: (2069/ 10721) 
yeah that is why that was your question are we going to have doom we are going to have a catastrophe we are going to get this thing turned around before we have yes i think we will but i do not i do not think we are ready to turn around yet i think we are still well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four or five times it is coming upon us so rapidly i strongly predict 

Recording: (2070/ 10721) 
tanks they claimed that we hit but 

Recording: (2071/ 10721) 
well i always look back and look at this there were how many thousands maybe millions of years before christ and here we are 2000 years after christ what makes us think think we are not going to live to 10 15 20 50000 years beyond i can not believe unless there is something like us our planet colliding with another planet or something that would destroy everything 

Recording: (2072/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2073/ 10721) 
好 

Recording: (2074/ 10721) 
i mean it has worked and we are ahead of the world there is no question about that in what the individual people persons have and how they are like on the other hand you know i am actually what i would like for the people who are in if it would just spread all over the world true communism 

Recording: (2075/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (2076/ 10721) 
such an idea and that indeed is going to take away from family in my way of thinking i can not imagine that i would have my wife producing somebody else is child over here and i am going to have the same thank you that is exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward war

no because all the kids take that california achievement test i do not know if you are familiar with that say you and i go to school you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus and we both make straight a is well when you take the california achievement test the a is mean nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those because you know they always pick on columbus public schools 

Recording: (2080/ 10721) 
well i think that my opinion is that if you ai not going to school and you are not going you are not working and everything you should be doing something besides causing problems you know and a lot of kids that is all they really want to do nowadays is just cause aggravation to people 

Recording: (2081/ 10721) 
and putting the street lights they have at easton 

Recording: (2082/ 10721) 
the people of this land had a way of worshiping god and that is the way i follow so a lot of people say that is native american and or say that is indian or whatever i do not care what they want to put on it but it is a natural way of following god is the way i put it that respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and so i went through

to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice but then here comes cooper is wife and his daughter and like his i am thinking they are putting all his family up in this hotel the night before a game i do not know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what i mean

Recording: (2099/ 10721) 
you know when she is in her middle years and tamara when she is you know but you know i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing is the one thing in life we get to do where there is no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or parameters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 

Recording: (2100/ 10721)

mmhmm yeah i you know i said i do not know i just i got to make some decisions here you know i do not want to put put too much pressure on it you know one of the elders told me hey you know cut yourself some slack and just relax for a while you know because i worked at a movie theater for a year and you know i got hassled about my hair you know told me the only thing

oh 

Recording: (2107/ 10721) 
they have been just troubled kids in the past i have 

Recording: (2108/ 10721) 
basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 

Recording: (2109/ 10721) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or whatnot just in a split second you know we might have that once in a life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know 

Recording: (2110/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (2111/ 10721) 
or somebody or later they will claim that i was coerced to saying that as i walked out the door you know and it is a big lie 

Recording: (2112/ 10721)

Recording: (2118/ 10721) 
what else 

Recording: (2119/ 10721) 
yeah that is kind of subjective although there is a paper that we hand out to our kids that tells exactly what is supposed to be in every part of this essay the first the introductory paragraph is supposed to consist of a way to capture the reader is attention it is supposed to supply background information it is supposed to stay state your thesis statement which tells mainly what the paper is going to be about and then you are supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas about your thesis 

Recording: (2120/ 10721) 
i do not allow no hitting no you know and she kind of lets it get away she lets him be a little rough because he is a boy but i do not you 

Recording: (2121/ 10721)

Recording: (2128/ 10721) 
it is beautiful and we like going to see the ski resorts and everything i do not really ski 

Recording: (2129/ 10721) 
you can see with the housing trends and there again it goes back to the stupid consumer i say stupid consumer because when i was in college i always said well the consumer had a fourth grade education level 

Recording: (2130/ 10721) 
no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (2131/ 10721) 
they can not fathom that 

Recording: (2132/ 10721) 
i am 

Recording: (2133/ 10721) 
well as far as the racism issue first they showed some figures on the news and actually it was like more 

Recording: (2134/ 10721) 
so once you convince people that there is nothing to be scared of here and there is nothing to be scared of there then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (2135/ 10721) 
or i would say 99 98 

Recording: (2136/ 10721) 
okay well i am not really from columbus either i have been here for a little over a year now my husband went to high school here and had a daughter while he was in high school so after he finished college he wanted to relocate here and we kind of lived between worthington and westerville kind of north columbus and i like it a lot

does that make sense 

Recording: (2185/ 10721) 
better to give and i sometimes try to weigh that if that is part of why i can not believe it is an attention getter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the work you do just within maybe one feels and i think it is a matter of being conscientious too 

Recording: (2186/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (2187/ 10721) 
this is in the summer now we go down to old tangier river to go fishing over there where doddridge is there used to be a bass recreation center with a miniature golf course and everything

uh huh uh-huh 

Recording: (2202/ 10721) 
i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran 

Recording: (2203/ 10721) 
but you can make them aware if somebody as an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable there should be some kind of a system to where these girls are slightest bit you know it is anonymous it is you know 

Recording: (2204/ 10721) 
and how many dollars does a consumer put into research as opposed to the business that is the inequity in our life and you are basically putting a shaft to the consumer 

Recording: (2205/ 10721) 
and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am going to keep with it and to me the straight a student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people nothing in their life at all and the other one has activities and they are giving of themselves to the community both my daughters have volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter egg hunts for the school 

Recording: (2206/ 10721) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy 

Recording: (2207/ 10721) 
child care 

Recording: (2208/ 10721) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (2209/ 10721) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time which i am sure she did i do not know i always thought i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (2210/ 10721) 
know that is another thing i forgot to mention i am going to stick them in a room while my husband is asleep exactly just 

Recording: (2211/ 10721) 
mhmm 

Recording: (2212/ 10721) 
when i did school levy campaigns and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is what the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done i used to always at the beginning of a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registrations registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is 

Recording: (2213/ 10721) 
i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can protect herself if the man is not willing to do it or whatever and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (2214/ 10721) 
cry

Recording: (2220/ 10721) 
who cares so people just think there is really no point to even vote it is too bad it really is 

Recording: (2221/ 10721) 
you know so 

Recording: (2222/ 10721) 
be exciting 

Recording: (2223/ 10721) 
but i do not think that it goes into values i do not associate rise in crime or something with like crime on tv or something i mean if there is a correlation i mean i am more of the you know like parents have a greater influence on the children than tv ever could i mean i watched a lot of tv but i feel that my parents taught me 

Recording: (2224/ 10721) 
i remember mcguffey lane and if you know 

Recording: (2225/ 10721) 
so there was a big fuss about that and two years later they came out with another study that says well they need to refurbish or not some schools closed a couple and then knocked some down and rebuilt them and it is like every two years it is a different direction it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like well if you are going to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (2226/ 10721) 
do you 

Recording: (2227/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2228/ 10721) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (2229/ 10721) 
yeah i like to go up there and play pool once in a while 

Recording: (2230/ 10721) 
so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra but once in a while we will have a student play get wind players play in it also and sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something 

Recording: (2231/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i do not see figure that out i think it is all fixed 

Recording: (2232/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (2233/ 10721) 
the opportunity to serve one another and that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourselves instead of others and i think as we have become older you start thinking about how much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not not the materialistic things that the university here professes to be the thing 

Recording: (2234/ 10721) 
oh yeah yes and no they are kind of weird weird they are a little bit more racist but at the same time i do not know they almost set up 

Recording: (2235/ 10721) 
in this family came from a buffalo new york working class he left he never looked back either and so it is kind of like people i think say you know how we are such i do not know the schools are always so grateful to us because we organize the state chess tournaments he started a baseball league for this building he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids lives

Recording: (2246/ 10721) 
actually i think it was stanford it was on a tv show i think it was like extra or something these older students met for the first time at their graduation they finished their whole college on the internet that would be very easy for me and i could do it at my convenience like when he is asleep i can go and do that i think it would make it a lot easier

all i remember is them talking about condoms i do not think they talked about anything besides that then again i could be remembering wrong but yes that i mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the hard line at the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have 

Recording: (2259/ 10721)

oh boy like action oh fight the bad guys yeah and now it is you know like looking in postulating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metaphor for things in real life and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a child and upon our culture i think it is kind of interesting

it is probably not as convinced and packed as most tourist areas because australia is a little out of the way you have to spend some time to get there you are like you are like you were florida california so it is like if you want to get at the beach you do not have to say oh like a memorial day it is like forget it you know just forget it it is like australia at least you do not to worry about you know about fighting the tourists

Recording: (2331/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2332/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (2333/ 10721)

Recording: (2351/ 10721) 
i am talking to the tv 

Recording: (2352/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (2353/ 10721) 
i think it is just if it were vietnam vets i think it is the authority thing you know you lied to me once you lied to me 400 times since then you know

in any pregnancy three weeks in either direction is considered full term 

Recording: (2355/ 10721) 
instructions from the creator through visions through a woman called the white buffalo calf woman that came to the people and brought them these ceremonies like the sweat lodge that brought them the sacred pipe it is not a belief thing it is a way of life and it is a way of life that is still in danger of being snuffed out but it will not be it is just it will not be it is just we gotta be careful about how and what you do and if you look you know native americans 

Recording: (2356/ 10721) 
i have never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women are not preached is because they do not show any kind of spiritual leadership i have never heard that said and there must be people who think that 

Recording: (2357/ 10721) 
what is that 

Recording: (2358/ 10721) 
relax get a deadend job that does not come home with me try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit grad school yeah but also enjoy all the things i did not get to do 

Recording: (2359/ 10721) 
i mean that goes along with my customs and beliefs i mean we are going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there is no way i am going to send him to a public school and even my husband is a boy scout leader and just listening to the boys there he did a last night on respect 

Recording: (2360/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (2361/ 10721) 
i mean just columbus is getting too big for what it is i mean it is why you have high crime rate high population population is number one and i would say pretty soon if they do not cage it up a little bit you know just have enough for the area instead of people being homeless and you know jobless everything like that i mean i 

Recording: (2362/ 10721) 
i mean you have to draw the line somewhere but now you said family yes i think the reason that at our age we look back everyone was born and everyone was loved by by a father when they were little and how their formative years are and the education the way they were taught as they were growing up does help them to become what that president is what any politician is any minister or anybody else 

Recording: (2363/ 10721) 
no i had a cat that just died 

Recording: (2364/ 10721) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent to me there is worse things i would think than dying i know in israel israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (2365/ 10721) 
my thing is you try to do your best on earth do the attributes you have whether it is supposed to be a missionary fine can you see a missionary working in the office there is needs for missionary work in the offices around us on the campus every day you are talking about diversity here all you got to do is just sit down you know it is not a numbers game it is not a number scheme at all just learn about one another and you are going to find out you know what i think they said the colorblind society that is what we got to do 

Recording: (2366/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (2367/ 10721) 
tickets 

Recording: (2368/ 10721) 
groups and different cliques but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that it had to have been more than just normal jocks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private 

Recording: (2369/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2370/ 10721) 
no because i think there is the ideal in everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do do and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now i mean i could never agree with abortion let us say i would stand by the church and most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the 

Recording: (2371/ 10721) 
yeah unfortunately well some people have to i mean you know the police officers and whatnot they are required to carry a gun but almost every kid i know that has had a gun even if they keep a gun hidden here and the bullets hidden over here 

Recording: (2372/ 10721) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (2373/ 10721) 
where are you from 

Recording: (2374/ 10721) 
seductively looking at the camera and you are like okay how many different bras do women really need that is not for the women i am sorry most women women by the time they are buying bras know what choices they have you do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men the men is heads are usually kind of they are not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all i mean it is just so unequal so we leave these guys or these poor boys that are 

Recording: (2375/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2376/ 10721) 
well that is competition to be earliest and the federal government is trying to stay out of the state is face so again that is another one of those things that just live with it i mean there is enough there is enough things to do and fight in life that that is not worth it 

Recording: (2377/ 10721) 
so the state would pay for it 

Recording: (2378/ 10721) 
now 

Recording: (2379/ 10721) 
about 13 years i think my dad once he got through with his residency and everything we moved to mansfield and he joined to practice and we have been living there ever since mansfield is about i would say 55 60000 people and ashland is probably about 25 to 30000 people but mansfield is

definitely definitely 

Recording: (2383/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2384/ 10721) 
let is put it this way when i was a kid you did not want to be brought home by the police you were actually scared of the police nowadays what is a kid scared of nothing 

Recording: (2385/ 10721) 
well we had a diamond jubilee at the village and coleman and teter both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i did not think that there was that much difference in them ideologically i think she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but in terms of having a black mayor i think that is good for columbus 

Recording: (2386/ 10721) 
play with him take him in on the kitchen floor so he can roam around because our kitchen is like open 

Recording: (2387/ 10721) 
and tried to get my family in it with some success not as much as i would like but i think they are all responsible welladjusted people and have families of their own i have nine grandkids grandchildren one greatgrandson and the boys were all on the sheet metal trade also 

Recording: (2388/ 10721) 
want them and i am like what he says we look at two children sitting side by side this one is making straight a is this one is sort of made b is but this one over here got into track when he or she was in freshman is and we noticed every track meet they basically were like last or second to last but they did it for four years then they 

Recording: (2389/ 10721)

Recording: (2390/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (2391/ 10721) 
mmhmm it is real wellknown 

Recording: (2392/ 10721) 
and she said she would get back to me on it well i have never heard nothing from her and she is done that to me i do not know how many times

wall that sacred heat wall 

Recording: (2395/ 10721) 
it is hard 

Recording: (2396/ 10721) 
things get away from it all yeah yeah so i came down here because he knew where my parents lived in plus columbus was a lot more opportunity 

Recording: (2397/ 10721) 
until i threatened to sue them 

Recording: (2398/ 10721)

Recording: (2402/ 10721)

Recording: (2424/ 10721) 
need 

Recording: (2425/ 10721) 
i think for the most part people can handle it obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up during the whole black rights movements and things like that i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like like 

Recording: (2426/ 10721) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (2427/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2428/ 10721) 
it is like an advertisement for it 

Recording: (2429/ 10721) 
how long have you been here 

Recording: (2430/ 10721) 
i had the same thing happen to my kid i smacked him one time 

Recording: (2431/ 10721) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (2432/ 10721) 
yeah and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i probably would not be working as a freelancer today i came to columbus there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (2433/ 10721) 
you know a check magnet

there 

Recording: (2446/ 10721)

yeah it is hard because i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong i do not like i said i am not going to condemn them at all like i said i have friends i understand what you are saying but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out maybe that child is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort 

Recording: (2450/ 10721) 
and she is very determined she has said that being pregnant and having this baby has made her focus on things a lot differently she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (2451/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2452/ 10721) 
there was an indepth story about that i think it was harper is magazine or what it was in a significant magazine where they had made a study of the new york situation and i found that quite interesting and very very impressive as a matter of fact what a remarkable thing to see i remember sending it in to the city council of dayton i just addressed it as a matter of fact 

Recording: (2453/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (2454/ 10721)

Recording: (2455/ 10721) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that 

Recording: (2456/ 10721) 
i am not real up on everything that is been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you would be able to say you know this is what there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of and i just think people kind of ladeedah and say well it is like this we will see what we can kind of do about it and then we will you know 

Recording: (2457/ 10721) 
everything and i come back and you know where my parents live there were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know this like giant cave hey martland you know i mean it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i would grown up with in america my whole life and you know not that i sort of changed completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to easton and i 

Recording: (2458/ 10721) 
and his parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyed my husband said i would have let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i want her to come home the other well the bottom line was hysterical because she and this little boy they are outside he is jumping on the trampoline i go up to him and i introduce myself and i say you know honey i said really sorry about the plans but i just you can i i just could not let her stay there that long he goes oh that is okay my mom would never let me do that so i am thinking here is how everybody is acting like i am the bad guy

Recording: (2514/ 10721) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (2515/ 10721) 
i think people are still fairly racist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other race relations fault i mean as far as like if you look at the black community and things like that you have like bet you have like the united negro college fund things like that 

Recording: (2516/ 10721) 
oh yeah i would have to work shift work yeah so

oh 

Recording: (2519/ 10721) 
yeah it is going to have to be from the bottom up i think and everybody keeps and i am just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything they are coming with 2000 on it i am hoping people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but i am hoping that it does mean since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope y2k i do not know what that really stands for i am just kidding

you 13yearold boy who was interviewed was saying oh you know he had slept with like 10 girls or something and i am thinking oh my gosh you know and he is 13 and had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is 

Recording: (2524/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2525/ 10721) 
yeah i was really glad that my son you know was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because you know the guys are real real nice he is always been real standoffish when it comes to

it is easy to spell it is easy to say and you can shorten it to m

so it is still just sitting down on my computer sits next to it the only thing is you take it down you can only have half a desk 

Recording: (2530/ 10721)

oh 

Recording: (2532/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (2533/ 10721) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a c or a b i mean there is all kinds of ways to modify give a reduced work amount give a kid a copy of another student is notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is 

Recording: (2534/ 10721) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things in little children children is minds and even like in junior high oh yeah we could do that there is just so much violence when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were allowed to watch it but you know what i mean the comics were not violent now it is too open for kids the parents they see the parents from 

Recording: (2535/ 10721) 
you know you can do anything for $50 a week you know you can work two hours a day you know for a week and $50 for two kids is really not that bad that much a week so 

Recording: (2536/ 10721) 
stuff done i do not know if it is just because you have to get agreement from everybody else in government before you can pass anything why do not these things get taken care of there are so many different issues that people want to look at and you end up focusing on things like philip morris which is the biggest thing in the whole world there are so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are important 

Recording: (2537/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (2538/ 10721) 
he left her there and they said they called me but i was around the sweeper so i did not hear the phone so left her there and he said that she was going to call back at a certain time and i was going to tell her what she could have done down picked him up and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until 11 

Recording: (2539/ 10721) 
yeah they will not bother it 

Recording: (2540/ 10721) 
yeah it is been like that every year basically 

Recording: (2541/ 10721) 
so that is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (2542/ 10721) 
you know and these schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my high school was like 400 people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand people excuse me people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know and checking everything and 

Recording: (2543/ 10721) 
it is implicit thing is to like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like 1917 i wanted an old house that had had not been capped up 

Recording: (2544/ 10721) 
i have one daughter 36 years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (2545/ 10721) 
nope 

Recording: (2546/ 10721) 
generally it is in the summertime that is the way it was when she was going to school now you know with her going to school like at st louis i guess it will be that way 

Recording: (2547/ 10721) 
definitely so my daughter definitely because she was working for camp scruxavit christ and she came home one weekend from oxford and 

Recording: (2548/ 10721) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i love animals and things but i just decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so i was engaged to him but i decided to 

Recording: (2549/ 10721) 
it is been remarkably well i mean i have not had any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange at about four weeks and i went in and i had a checkup and my doctor thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound well the thing is they did this ultrasound and they did not find anything so which was really kind of creepy because they did not know because there is that whole tubal pregnancy thing and all this stuff and the guy that did my ultrasound was not my regular doctor and he is kind of well he is just a little 

Recording: (2550/ 10721) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active not so much the type of work that i do but i think she is very charitable very giving very 

Recording: (2551/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i can not say that there would be any difference with them 

Recording: (2552/ 10721) 
convict white men of killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (2553/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2554/ 10721) 
because i have seen things that are not physically possible 

Recording: (2555/ 10721) 
bad acoustics really 

Recording: (2556/ 10721) 
well yeah we got broke into i think twice and stuff got stolen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into the gas siphon pretty much everybody around there has been criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (2557/ 10721) 
so the money is just kind of wasted 

Recording: (2558/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2559/ 10721) 
well when i was growing up there was not that much violence and i could go in the end and i have done it my name ai not on this report so you can not do nothing about it 

Recording: (2560/ 10721) 
but they do not use umbrellas i mean they just go through it they are just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket you know because it is not a hard rain and the first year i was there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there is no cold real cold winter and and then from july august september and october is just gorgeous just so gorgeous but i like that fog and that mist and 

Recording: (2561/ 10721) 
a real slap in the face for him so he was really mean after that so i left i just walked out i picked the kids up at the bus stop and they are like mommy what are you doing i said we are going somewhere let us get in the car so but yeah just a couple experiences like that that will make you do other things you know i stayed tough and i you know got other jobs and 

Recording: (2562/ 10721) 
but it is mind boggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only 200 people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams it is just mind boggling all these people you graduate with no handful of people and do not know anybody else you know a lot more of a tightknit group as a child we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (2563/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (2564/ 10721) 
i think that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not work in ways that other people is do so i think a lot of it too has to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real a lot more temperamental we always joke that predictable and some of those things are not even temperate or not things you would use to describe me

no 

Recording: (2575/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (2576/ 10721) 
what they should do is just tell people that their kids do not get to go to school i bet the attitude changes pretty fast 

Recording: (2577/ 10721) 
and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot an animal they would use it for food i know one time that they gave it to a family that was did not have any money and did not have any food they would not kill some animals and gave it to them i do not have a problem with that my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he believes whatever charlton heston tells him 

Recording: (2578/ 10721) 
mmhmm

uhhuh uhhuh well and you know that song by itself probably if i just heard it once or twice it is okay yeah and she is an interesting character i guess i mean i do not know everything about her but i i remember that she insulted the pope yeah 

Recording: (2580/ 10721) 
and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it because after all somebody speaking up and they want to do things my way or bing crosby who was it no um 

Recording: (2581/ 10721) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack on the bottom with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know the most effective penalty for me was my mother would go out near a tree and she would break a twig off and she would smack me across the shoulder 

Recording: (2582/ 10721) 
even if my kids not there they will stop by my house just to say hi

Recording: (2586/ 10721) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument i do not think we ever got a is b is and c is yeah 

Recording: (2587/ 10721) 
yeah right 

Recording: (2588/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2589/ 10721) 
because it is more open and you count it in terms of civil rights my boyfriend thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through you know talking to people talking to them religionwise i do not think it is a sin i think that your sexuality is geneticbased 

Recording: (2590/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2591/ 10721) 
then i 

Recording: (2592/ 10721) 
yes too but that has primarily because of necessity more often than not maybe even today it is less than that because it is been because of a loss of a parent or inability of a parent or parents being able to handle those children so yes those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage though scott 

Recording: (2593/ 10721) 
this is fun 

Recording: (2594/ 10721) 
yeah it is it is nice it works out well 

Recording: (2595/ 10721) 
you can not especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (2596/ 10721) 
and they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them 

Recording: (2597/ 10721) 
you start thinking a little differently and i think as you talk you should be talking to some older people i am seeing people in the in their 80s to find out how the progression of life is is and how you think because when you go to estate sales all you are talking about this profit motive they are sitting on the lawns the quality of life is in the mind of the person you avoid it all the time 

Recording: (2598/ 10721) 
yeah but you just have to have something to go by and this is a close thing and we have to just go with it you know i mean you can not go back and try to read i do not know somebody was trying to rearrange the calendar one time were not they 

Recording: (2599/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2600/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (2601/ 10721) 
is there the resentment to things like mcdonald is they are too or is it 

Recording: (2602/ 10721) 
over that right 

Recording: (2603/ 10721) 
argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what genes they might inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not later on you will find out but still you can go back and you can find the parent 

Recording: (2604/ 10721) 
like right now their biggest campaign is some elementary school i believe no i think it is a high school in marion was built on an old weapons depot and so like leukemia has risen and so like that is their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and get that changed they have also done other things other they do anything dealing with the environment like exposure things like that 

Recording: (2605/ 10721) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like ok i will go to europe

Recording: (2652/ 10721) 
now i think that those four kids at least among my grandchildren are getting pretty much at the same training that i did or maybe better than i did my oldest son is two daughters arei do not know if they are still alive well they are good kids and they are smart kids but i do not think that they have the moral grounding that 

Recording: (2653/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (2654/ 10721) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2655/ 10721) 
she is she is adorable how old is she in this picture 

Recording: (2656/ 10721) 
i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (2657/ 10721) 
it is just like the people you see go to church i walk out of church and see somebody sitting there that is homeless 

Recording: (2658/ 10721) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the end most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (2659/ 10721) 
or do you want to run over me is that what you want to do 

Recording: (2660/ 10721) 
right in there yeah and i had friends that lived in buckhead 

Recording: (2661/ 10721) 
nation because of their actual sitting down and hands on critiquing these children like friend of mine she was pretty much i would not put her borderline illiterate but she did not know how to read or write 

Recording: (2662/ 10721) 
they are like oh they are like the people in crocodile dundee but they are just no they are just like 

Recording: (2663/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (2664/ 10721) 
eastern religions and i have listened to the jehovah is witnesses and then when i read in the book of mormon it is just it is a feeling of like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and so that is why i really felt at home with this and that is why i decided 

Recording: (2665/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2666/ 10721) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then you know you should not do it 

Recording: (2667/ 10721) 
oh most of it is horribly liberal and they always find some way to misrepresent like kerwin 

Recording: (2668/ 10721) 
indirectly yes 

Recording: (2669/ 10721) 
this will be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off if their cats are sick

Recording: (2675/ 10721) 
yeah there was no property 

Recording: (2676/ 10721) 
i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun they will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their hands on it guns they are basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them 

Recording: (2677/ 10721)

i mean to me you are supposed to earn your grade 

Recording: (2683/ 10721) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (2684/ 10721) 
oh gosh that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (2685/ 10721) 
he always says 

Recording: (2686/ 10721) 
yeah my grandmother is from ireland my grandmother and grandfather are both from ireland 

Recording: (2687/ 10721) 
buh 

Recording: (2688/ 10721) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (2689/ 10721) 
i come back and it is just 

Recording: (2690/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2691/ 10721) 
right at the age that they were 

Recording: (2692/ 10721) 
you are right 

Recording: (2693/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like 12 and 13 and they have been having sex since they were 10 it is just like and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (2694/ 10721) 
but with kids in there just so much more active at an early age 

Recording: (2695/ 10721) 
people that just really want to teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people want to like even went into teaching at all you know but i think that would help just making it more more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grade it is like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more compulsory education is weird like being forced to 

Recording: (2696/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2697/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (2698/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2699/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2700/ 10721) 
no i just think that typically you see a lot of places that are under construction not very many people working there 

Recording: (2701/ 10721) 
just because you are i mean i was not really an athletic i did play sports when i was in high school but i would dance or was not any good you know just like other guys but whether i did or whether i did not you know i do not know nobody picked on me i mean one time i got into it with one of the centers in football you know a big old guy and i was still about the same size 

Recording: (2702/ 10721) 
i am from here columbus ohio 

Recording: (2703/ 10721) 
i do all of our own taxes i keep thinking i must be doing it wrong because it is not that hard everybody acts like all this is such a big deal 

Recording: (2704/ 10721) 
well i suppose well i decided that i was going to date a black guy and my husband my dad did not like that at all so he disowned me and so now he i am married to my husband and 

Recording: (2705/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2706/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2707/ 10721) 
yeah it is mainly what happens is you get all the out of town bad stuff i mean it just kind of absorbs like a sponge challenge 

Recording: (2708/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (2709/ 10721) 
boring 

Recording: (2710/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2711/ 10721) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is colored by the fact that i collected data for 20 years from employers i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing yeah i am just a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (2712/ 10721) 
damn it 

Recording: (2713/ 10721) 
just getting over there 

Recording: (2714/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2715/ 10721) 
she is pretty nice i mean she is definitely least standable 

Recording: (2716/ 10721) 
yeah most of them 

Recording: (2717/ 10721) 
i thought this was something like maybe unique to the states 

Recording: (2718/ 10721) 
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm 

Recording: (2719/ 10721) 
you three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy 

Recording: (2720/ 10721) 
i guess that happened just here in town a couple about a week ago or something like that you know where a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really who is really to fault who is really to who is guilty i do not know i would like to have not today they ever would have but if one of the two that you that columbine you know if they would have survived i would like to 

Recording: (2721/ 10721) 
i think the people who have already graduated there like the doctors and the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation among adults just that the kids want to go it is just thought of as a somewhat party school 

Recording: (2722/ 10721) 
oh definitely definitely well i have never had a dog and i have always wanted one 

Recording: (2723/ 10721) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day just like it is mine to take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my responsibility i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is some law that protects me people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or off the influence of medication in case 

Recording: (2724/ 10721) 
think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidate a over candidate b because protect abortion rights that is going to divide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2725/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (2726/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (2727/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (2728/ 10721) 
we have got a nice big house a barn some tractors no animals well we have got a dog but it is a farm in the sense that we have got a barn we have got tractors we lease some of the land out to a farmer who actually works in plant stuff my dad is a doctor 

Recording: (2729/ 10721) 
i think the fact that things like responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of their family you can be divorced and still take care of your family things as far as people getting pregnant and then this person goes off and leaves and you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and 

Recording: (2730/ 10721) 
he admits now that he felt neglected at that period 

Recording: (2731/ 10721) 
that flipped me out 

Recording: (2732/ 10721) 
and move on maybe somebody else does and that is the way i am going to be and like i said she can clean up and look like a beauty queen but she can also look just like you know just basically you know like she was raking leaves 10 minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect and i just think that is sort of shallow because because i look at people who have to have the facelifts and they have to have the perfect hair and they have to have the perfect clothes it is like you are so insecure about the 

Recording: (2733/ 10721) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones every one of them is different 

Recording: (2734/ 10721) 
but everybody in my family is mechanically inclined 

Recording: (2735/ 10721) 
i think so 

Recording: (2736/ 10721) 
um i when i was growing up i had a whole glare of cats 

Recording: (2737/ 10721)

Recording: (2738/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2739/ 10721) 
legal is better 

Recording: (2740/ 10721) 
who do you think wants to keep you from doing something that will help you because people that is land and indigenous tribes all over the world they do not follow the bible they have done pretty damn good you know 

Recording: (2741/ 10721) 
no i think we are only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i have known from middle school and following them up and you know they just all go their different ways like the one girl i was friends with at willow park i mean she was a grade lower than me but when we would seen each other in the halls like hey what is up and we would talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that and high school i did not know anything i know she was bad 

Recording: (2742/ 10721) 
yeah yeah that is 

Recording: (2743/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2744/ 10721) 
i do and i tell them they will be like oh i have some things around the house that need to be done so i would go there and they would tell people and 

Recording: (2745/ 10721) 
we have to pay for the uh we have a uh yeah we are paying for it 

Recording: (2746/ 10721) 
yeah i do not think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life 

Recording: (2747/ 10721) 
well because you know 

Recording: (2748/ 10721) 
not at that time 

Recording: (2749/ 10721) 
you know do the screening 

Recording: (2750/ 10721) 
yeah right if you are lucky but i mean there is the person that says that and then there is the other person that says well i sure i admire what you do and i would not be a teacher for anything in this world you know the one that is just in awe of you 

Recording: (2751/ 10721) 
now 

Recording: (2752/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2753/ 10721) 
you do not realize it 

Recording: (2754/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2755/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (2756/ 10721) 
neither side is going to do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and so he knew hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei hei

Recording: (2759/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2760/ 10721) 
i mean most men are dogs yeah 

Recording: (2761/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (2762/ 10721) 
i do not have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like you know you should get out before you actually fail the class it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that is what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just it is unwise in whether or not it was worthwhile and i believe that it is horribly worthwhile now and yet now they are not taking classes 

Recording: (2763/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (2764/ 10721) 
see that is the difference worthington has a program for them one of the women that i worked with she was having so many problems similar to mine mine when her son was in columbus schools and she moved to westerville and they put him in a class for that and i took care of it you 

Recording: (2765/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (2766/ 10721) 
oh it is horrible it was horrible because you watch it and you think oh my god 

Recording: (2767/ 10721) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age too 

Recording: (2768/ 10721) 
just because it is been three weeks now not only that there is something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they mess 

Recording: (2769/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2770/ 10721) 
and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not die you do not physically maybe there is no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it will not 

Recording: (2771/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2772/ 10721) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized 

Recording: (2773/ 10721) 
that you really did not need because then you get more bang for your bucks 

Recording: (2774/ 10721) 
you know not that i am talking negative about my mother that she has some neurological damage 

Recording: (2775/ 10721) 
um well just even like the parks 

Recording: (2776/ 10721) 
not the actual going through it you know to me it was to her but the aftermath basically you know you just 

Recording: (2777/ 10721) 
if you read it to yourself out loud like if you are in a room by yourself and you read out loud do you remember it better than if you read it silently if you hear yourself say the words

Recording: (2781/ 10721) 
i am not sure yet at least based on money raised it looks like george w could trample almost anybody but george w has and to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean but i do not think that i am average in that i do not go for the

Recording: (2786/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2787/ 10721) 
that does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i said it just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (2788/ 10721) 
i got a bad heart i do not know what that would do to me 

Recording: (2789/ 10721) 
i adore you oh yeah okay oh yeah boy yeah yeah stupid but i like to do something like that i would not mind having some kind of place for you know you see a lot of different downandout type people and everything and really nobody really trying to help them or nothing you know and i 

Recording: (2790/ 10721) 
that is a roundabout way of getting there

Recording: (2794/ 10721) 
yeah i have been thoroughly spoiled you know like catfish bish subs those are kinda 

Recording: (2795/ 10721) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them 

Recording: (2796/ 10721) 
well i do not think they should be responsible but i think kids go to school and they need role models good teachers and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late 80s early 90s you know the schools a lot of them were really bad i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and they

Recording: (2832/ 10721) 
keep my public is hands until the right time but i think that will all in all the solution would be get rid of the criminals well how are you gonna do that you do not know somebody is a criminal until they do something for the first time

Recording: (2933/ 10721) 
i maybe retired last year but she had taught columbus for 20 years or something like that and so i think his information is good but i guess the way he handles things sometimes gets through to people

Recording: (2935/ 10721) 
so they got us kids vaccinated in time but dad did not 

Recording: (2936/ 10721) 
but you know he just drinks all the time to try to ease the pain and the pain really should have been done gone by as much as he drank in his life so i think there is a lot of people that can use that as an excuse 

Recording: (2937/ 10721) 
ride 

Recording: (2938/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (2939/ 10721)

mmhmm 

Recording: (2952/ 10721) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it than what we will probably ever know they really have not checked into the background of the parents as to what their beliefs were in arizona and i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidentally happening where some kid shoots another kid you know and the parents are responsible for it and everything these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed you 

Recording: (2953/ 10721)

Recording: (3043/ 10721) 
not that they could have stopped it but they should have known what was going on i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong with these kids who are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways you know that they are going to turning a different you know i just i blame them though 

Recording: (3044/ 10721)

Recording: (3048/ 10721) 
you would sleep in three pairs of sweats so you would lose about two and a half pounds in your sleep 

Recording: (3049/ 10721) 
or something like that just for something to do 

Recording: (3050/ 10721) 
yes

so we would be like a waitress or clerical

mmm 

Recording: (3053/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3054/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (3055/ 10721) 
would you do oh god i feel like i was a parent before i was a parent that is the way it felt some of my friends like like this guy i used to hang out with he used to run into lockers in high school i am like that is so kid 

Recording: (3056/ 10721) 
and he had been through a counseling experience before and he just played along with it then to get out of it i think 

Recording: (3057/ 10721) 
it did not hurt me none i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors it is your neighborhood your neighbors most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had gocarts we had minibikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3058/ 10721) 
historically you know my dad is people were democrats but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed to turn republican i guess but you know there is some of the conservative values that are very important to me you know but then there is some social things that are all important too 

Recording: (3059/ 10721) 
no it was kind of disturbing actually 

Recording: (3060/ 10721) 
i make them do their webbing and get their rough draft started and then they can go to the computer because i find they are a little more creative when they get to think about adding pictures and we call it publishing it when you get to the publishing stage 

Recording: (3061/ 10721) 
i had stuff in and there was a paper they used to send to parents of students i think they stopped publishing that i had stuff in that frequently i have had some stuff in lately and i am working on football stuff right now 

Recording: (3062/ 10721) 
really okay i did not know there was like a ripple effect for a stir i thought you know being so remote you know 

Recording: (3063/ 10721)

watching it for a while period and then since deep space nine left i needed a little star trek fix every once in a while so i started watching it i also do not have cable so it is on upn and 53 does not come in terribly well so sometimes it is like i do not want to kind of see what is going on 

Recording: (3068/ 10721)

Recording: (3072/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3073/ 10721) 
i have a very general opposition to this kind of thing no matter where it is anymore my being 76 years of age has a major you are bearing because i see the total destruction of our center cities and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just cities the size of columbus which is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washington courthouse which maybe have 15000 or 

Recording: (3074/ 10721) 
four years ago i do not know it is been a while four and a half years ago something like that 

Recording: (3075/ 10721) 
i am trying not to laugh out loud way back and what was it 1670 or something colonials 

Recording: (3076/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (3077/ 10721) 
they just she was drinking i mean terrible alcoholic and very his father was very abusive and they were not even married 

Recording: (3078/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3079/ 10721) 
there are some foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding classes 

Recording: (3080/ 10721) 
you just keep going that is part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going 

Recording: (3081/ 10721)

Recording: (3082/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (3083/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (3084/ 10721) 
yeah across the street is the dental and the hospital so people were really loud down there 

Recording: (3085/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3086/ 10721) 
things out of that maternal milk why can not you instead of getting off the shelf 

Recording: (3087/ 10721) 
feeling very good 

Recording: (3088/ 10721) 
i got one sister 

Recording: (3089/ 10721) 
now 

Recording: (3090/ 10721) 
well my grandmother was ill 

Recording: (3091/ 10721) 
about the same number 

Recording: (3092/ 10721) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (3093/ 10721) 
well it starts with allowing heather has two mommies 

Recording: (3094/ 10721) 
and they are less hyper about like you know bad things for people to do you know the drinking the smoking they are just not as strict about it it basically 

Recording: (3095/ 10721) 
it kind of yeah well i have seen worse so so and they are doing this i think it is called sit and reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and they do that for you know like five minutes the first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (3096/ 10721) 
i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked but i arranged my life around her so that even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at 5 in the evening and she went to bed at 730 so i was with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches you 

Recording: (3097/ 10721) 
motherly instinct towards you know and they are like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (3098/ 10721) 
so i figure it is much better to be nice to them there is also times when everybody makes errors and maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go you know like there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back and go do you mean left or right there and i go yes it is correct turn left you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i feel kindness goes a long way and the pilots the same way most often 

Recording: (3099/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah 

Recording: (3100/ 10721) 
and he let me fire at one range but i got about 50 or 75 yards from what we were shooting at

yeah 

Recording: (3107/ 10721) 
right right and again if it is criminal activity you want somebody to stop it and know about it i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about what is to prevent them from going and finding out what some company is doing what research is threat on the web too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research developing a new product or something you 

Recording: (3108/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (3109/ 10721)

Recording: (3116/ 10721) 
um i am a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3117/ 10721) 
well my son started in public school for kindergarten and he just my son is a very social child will say he is the one that talks too much there is a teacher saying he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play

and that is just 

Recording: (3124/ 10721)

reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that is just going to be added to everything else what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and pray praise him and that he is doing a good job and that we are moving along steadily and i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means i made that mistake when i was president of the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all

Recording: (3169/ 10721) 
there is no need to attack students over it and i read some article in the lantern i do not know why i read that i hate that paper but anyway i read some article article that the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so they will go whine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment 

Recording: (3170/ 10721) 
that was part of the reason 

Recording: (3171/ 10721)

Recording: (3176/ 10721) 
you know what i mean it do not matter to me whether you are black or white it matters to me whatever way you treat me like when i first got out of the services when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they could not hire me because that was when they first come down with a mandate that they can only hire blacks 

Recording: (3177/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (3178/ 10721) 
who ran that particular campaign would have lost and i like to think that age does not matter but she came across as old to me also i like to think i am not prejudiced on any issue but if there was someone who had been right on the issues i do not care if she was old i would have voted for her i just did not support the issues i supported she was wrong on i did not like that she tried to use the police chief in such a negative way 

Recording: (3179/ 10721) 
he was taken in by a family that was members of the mormon church 

Recording: (3180/ 10721) 
i you know there are certain like my car i love cars and you know you take the car to car wash it is like $750 or $8 and you wash it in the driveway and it is about a quarter you know it is like it takes time if you if you have no time and you know that i have friends at work that their the mom is a taxi cab driver and the dad is the worker bee

it was revolutionary when we announced we were going to use ibm pcs for access to the system and we would provide you software you could do some of the work that you are used to doing with us in your computer and it is like it was incredible we had trouble with the demand it was like triple what we expected librarians were ready for it 

Recording: (3188/ 10721) 
now you will hear me way too much 

Recording: (3189/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3190/ 10721) 
but that is how i seeon the roof i see the old man is name regular crop they had when they were out there my parents was kids 

Recording: (3191/ 10721) 
well let us see i got divorced when my oldest was three and my youngest was about six months almost a year so i have raised them basically myself yeah so i did go back to work 

Recording: (3192/ 10721) 
or ohio yeah i think i am not really sure i know they are from ireland 

Recording: (3193/ 10721) 
but you understand what i am saying you are going to have to make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal 

Recording: (3194/ 10721) 
yeah that is pretty much what we was made to do back in the pioneer days you did not have this crap with the kid going yeah fix me some canned ravioli or you gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his own meals that is an interesting thing i just saw in the news week i was reading that 

Recording: (3195/ 10721) 
trying to cram organic into my head 

Recording: (3196/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3197/ 10721) 
do they have like these big lecture halls over there too 

Recording: (3198/ 10721) 
they are afraid we are going to get them addicted to the internet or something the nintendo and those type of things are bad enough they are a good babysitter you need to limit it 

Recording: (3199/ 10721) 
a little bit yeah 

Recording: (3200/ 10721) 
i have never known of him 

Recording: (3201/ 10721) 
which was see with those guns of ours we figured within 10 yards was a hit if you had one of those things 37 pounds of tnt would go off within 10 yards of it 

Recording: (3202/ 10721) 
but it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know 

Recording: (3203/ 10721) 
just because you sin does not mean you are going to hell 

Recording: (3204/ 10721) 
well yeah and my daughter is the opposite of that but he would do that and so he was not he was very frightened he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble problem but he did not understand what was going on and if there was not a structure he would go to school every day and not know what to expect because it was not like we will do this and then 

Recording: (3205/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3206/ 10721) 
that is why they have such sharp claws i guess so they can lock in when those hit your head that would hurt kamikaze kowalski and the community 

Recording: (3207/ 10721) 
and bleeding so we had to go back to the hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son and this was not unusual it was a horrible period i think what made my wife and i the angriest was that he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (3208/ 10721) 
no no no no no i mean she is a great person she is a good christian but there is some things about her that i would not want in a wife ake snay on that but i have been single since probably march and i am probably going to stay that way for a while mainly because i do not like anybody nobody likes me it that way i do not 

Recording: (3209/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (3210/ 10721) 
oh yeah yep 

Recording: (3211/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (3212/ 10721) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because of the drug and alcohol they will not put him on some of the medications but as far as i can tell he is been pretty clear and clean on that and you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she she lately has been going with him to the psychologist and we have been paying for it but we do not have a problem with that because he is going he likes the 

Recording: (3213/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3214/ 10721) 
oh yeah i have no idea 

Recording: (3215/ 10721) 
like that war divided people but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not and in protecting choice i am starting to see that now even in the gore campaign i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and if you want to protect that right you have got 

Recording: (3216/ 10721) 
and it is like i like how it is like i thought about going to antioch but it was really expensive and like i do not know but just because it is in schools more of a nontraditional type where they give you like evaluations and you do not get grades like so so then that is what that is what i heard it is like in antioch where the professor writes a couple page paper on your performance on the quarter and that really shows that and that is a lot of work for the professor but that really shows that he is really involved in noticing what 

Recording: (3217/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah yeah 

Recording: (3218/ 10721) 
northland mall 

Recording: (3219/ 10721) 
because they kicked me out for some dumb reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking the blame 

Recording: (3220/ 10721) 
part of the aging process and also partly because i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just 

Recording: (3221/ 10721) 
no not at all i would have rather voted for mccain over bush because bush he comes from a political family which i am not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but i am saying like bush is he just seems like he did not really like everything is been handed to him in life and the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if you did drugs okay everyone 

Recording: (3222/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3223/ 10721) 
so i started watching and got i do not want to say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think back when i started doing the painting i graduated from high school in 94 just to put things in a little perspective so it was my first couple years years of college from sort of the second half of high school to my first couple years of college i just sort of just i do not know 

Recording: (3224/ 10721) 
he has different levels of things that people need at different ages and things like that at 40 you think wow you really need to make a difference or do something and and i can see that because i have gone through all the phases that he is talking about

Recording: (3227/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3228/ 10721) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going to have a great time with your kids and it is just it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it is worth it 

Recording: (3229/ 10721) 
um actually i guess it is something that is always sort of been there i have always been real big on just building things been real big hands on and last summer i helped my dad build a garage onto his house like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything like that i just filled everything up from there and it turned out really well i mean it was really fun to do i mean it is i liked it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time 

Recording: (3230/ 10721) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (3231/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (3232/ 10721) 
like say going to ohare you have to call for release times to these different airports and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like at 27 past the hour so they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is airline it is like you and i and 500 people want to get to this room 10 oclock today 

Recording: (3233/ 10721) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like to design i am maybe a designer but you know like i went to i was in police law enforcement 

Recording: (3234/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3235/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3236/ 10721) 
so there is always something going wrong with the wiring or the plumbing or the something it seemed like a good idea about 25 years ago to get a house that older house but no not anymore 

Recording: (3237/ 10721) 
you know he says that e equals mc squared i say it is e equals mc cubed because the world is three dimensional it is not two dimensional dimensional limits and everything but you look at history relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (3238/ 10721) 
cry 

Recording: (3239/ 10721) 
plays and just things that are different my sociology and psychology teacher he was the same guy that taught history he was real good too it was really crazy obviously but like it is just like interesting like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about it just 

Recording: (3240/ 10721) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3241/ 10721) 
right right it probably went out of business when he left 

Recording: (3242/ 10721) 
it was supposedly it was my job but as you know the parents always get stuck i have a brother 

Recording: (3243/ 10721) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like 

Recording: (3244/ 10721) 
i guess that would be a slightly different part i am not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (3245/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (3246/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3247/ 10721) 
oh boy they are just really fun people to deal with 

Recording: (3248/ 10721) 
right

yeah i am not going to go to that world i want you to go to that place 

Recording: (3254/ 10721) 
and socially too i mean mostly adhd and ld kids are emotionally immature as well so like the songs that their friends are listening to and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they are still acting like a fifth grader you know they are not interested in girls and they are still listening to music that younger kids would like they are just generally socially they mature a little slower it takes them longer to catch up 

Recording: (3255/ 10721) 
the watchtowers yeah you can look it up and say has anybody got their sights on me yeah because that is it is like you know like you know that is like the world war ii stuff you know there is like remains i am sure it is like you get to see the wall it is like i mean i am sure there is like from what i understand it was like 

Recording: (3256/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3257/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (3258/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah i should not have to do this i am the responsible for the happiness of this family 

Recording: (3259/ 10721) 
they used to have the laser light show downtown they do not have it anymore you know just even if you do one thing free a month 

Recording: (3260/ 10721) 
i have you know there are kids in the neighborhood and the grownups talk and i talk to the kids too there is a girl that lives next door we talk a lot she just started at everett the arts middle school

Recording: (3263/ 10721) 
well i mean most of it was me going over it with him and just you know i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and you know just doing the things that worked for him and as an individual 

Recording: (3264/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3265/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3266/ 10721) 
and then when they did the blood test they found out i had hypertension plus cardiovascular diseases had nothing to do with drugs 

Recording: (3267/ 10721) 
there is so much negativity on the national news i do not know if it will just be blended in or if people will associate that with columbus 

Recording: (3268/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3269/ 10721) 
but like if you said we will have a bus service we will go and pick you guys up you know and then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them like it does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything if you are running three shifts you could just here is a box of donuts and some milk or something and that does not cost the company that much

mbc 뉴스 김수진입니다 

Recording: (3271/ 10721) 
whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make 75 cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted 80 cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that 

Recording: (3272/ 10721) 
i think screening would be very difficult especially because at that age you are going to have a lot of people who or people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (3273/ 10721) 
really that is awesome 

Recording: (3274/ 10721) 
it is kind of a fun game it is just strange because i came down in semesters so there was still a month where everyone was down here and now there is nobody down here so it is myself my two roommates and maybe a handful of other people that we know so the social aspect has diminished a lot but that is still i mean for fun we play a lot of video games i guess you would think the natural things you would expect from a college guy

Recording: (3298/ 10721) 
williams freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and i had my bike stolen william will either grow in his faith significantly or will go exact opposite direction i knew one way or another what happened because my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh

Recording: (3310/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (3311/ 10721) 
they stopped federally funding osu that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people move like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years till i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to uproot my daughters out of school and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (3312/ 10721) 
so is there a large american population is there any problems just finding people from the states 

Recording: (3313/ 10721)

Recording: (3323/ 10721)

Recording: (3327/ 10721) 
every week i record them too yeah like xfiles

that is a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted 25 feet in the air against the pine tree found out see gored through the person is leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death i do not have any sympathy for him 

Recording: (3329/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (3330/ 10721) 
is not 

Recording: (3331/ 10721) 
then have it executed as it is now 

Recording: (3332/ 10721) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizenship and the english and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know add subtract multiply 

Recording: (3333/ 10721) 
which made it a little inconvenient when he lived in the twin towers in the dorm because if i needed him to come home or something you know i do not know if i got to get it get to my car some kind of way you know 

Recording: (3334/ 10721) 
just to get into the school there is about 30 people applying they let three in 

Recording: (3335/ 10721) 
yeah and it just did not work 

Recording: (3336/ 10721) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (3337/ 10721) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (3338/ 10721) 
yeah exactly so i said well i went to padre island i said well i did not want to get in texas so 

Recording: (3339/ 10721) 
yeah i thought that was interesting so it is a values you know the christian values thing i do not have a problem with it we had a little problem it was like my son had to learn the hail mary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us write it down for us because we did not know and they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and we did not know you know little things like that but it was not a problem there was a problem with my son for a while because 

Recording: (3340/ 10721) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (3341/ 10721) 
when i started dating at almost 17 so no i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are i personally do not think a school can do it 

Recording: (3342/ 10721) 
do whatever i want to some degree 

Recording: (3343/ 10721) 
i said this will never work i am not interested take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with us just work with us we will take care of this so i end up selling to him for 144 but it was just funny because i thought i thought they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (3344/ 10721) 
and that is what i am saying atoning for sins it is quite a hypocrisy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they do i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went through all my life over the door of the church is a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now 

Recording: (3345/ 10721) 
figures 

Recording: (3346/ 10721) 
no but i have two daughters and two sons i heard my daughters talking about they want to do something special for my 65th birthday they had given me a party on my 60th so i do not know what it is going to be but i think they will do they talked about something in the way of a trip so maybe something the three of us can do together so i am just 

Recording: (3347/ 10721) 
and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year would have been november we would take those shoes out and depending upon and whose foot fit those shoes those would be the person who wore them it would not be the one who had worn them in the spring because he is growing in the meantime and it may go to another another and i can remember we passed shoes down as many as four wee children now my dad also repaired shoes 

Recording: (3348/ 10721) 
and when i started as an apprentice in the shop they said well we will start you at a dollar an hour that sounds pretty good you know in 1945 the fall of 1945 so then as things worked out in washington dc they came out with a gli bill of rights we found out that that would apply to apprentices too 

Recording: (3349/ 10721) 
i do not think they get the attention they need 

Recording: (3350/ 10721) 
the doorknob and 

Recording: (3351/ 10721) 
i do not want to like i do not want to spin like i just want to like i am gonna try and do different things like like most music i listen to is like bass where it is like bass lines and like 

Recording: (3352/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (3353/ 10721) 
yeah because i do not like vegetables my hands are going to sleep i do not like vegetables is what it is so it is real hard for me 

Recording: (3354/ 10721) 
and now they live in gay relationships 

Recording: (3355/ 10721) 
i thought they would give you at least student rates or graduate student rates or whatever like the wexner center 

Recording: (3356/ 10721) 
that is how i feel that is what i believe i choose to believe that 

Recording: (3357/ 10721) 
he just kept saying gas gas gas i kept saying i do not want to guess this is the first day of school i have got lots of stuff to do we do not have time to play guessing games i said spell your last name you said g u e s s talk about feeling stupid

we were married 11 years 

Recording: (3359/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3360/ 10721) 
to work for that aspect we asked them if they wanted to go on a project with the class and so forth fine but you have got to participate in it too we will match you with what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them responsibilities they grew up with that aspect they learned by being around some older people which i think was good 

Recording: (3361/ 10721) 
yeah well you know 

Recording: (3362/ 10721) 
we have not done that much yet because his family lives in albuquerque new mexico 

Recording: (3363/ 10721) 
and we had like tapes we listened to with native speakers so you got really good really quick 

Recording: (3364/ 10721) 
it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like a mission home 

Recording: (3365/ 10721) 
but when you can not grow much of anything on it it is 

Recording: (3366/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (3367/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (3368/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (3369/ 10721) 
you know they all get sidelined and sidetracked by special and private interests and that is the bottom line and it is sad but there is so i choose not to involve myself and that as much as possible we ended up settling for 

Recording: (3370/ 10721) 
they do they really okay 

Recording: (3371/ 10721) 
where you are from you say 

Recording: (3372/ 10721)

Recording: (3373/ 10721) 
and you know mothers have to work you just can not you know stay home and be that you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on that needs to be restructured so 

Recording: (3374/ 10721)

Recording: (3376/ 10721) 
a year i often thought it would be great for marketing take all those figures and add up and see if it adds up to 100 and if it does then where are your goals see when i bought a house the financier came i went to his office and he said oh mr no problem no problem you can get that house i said i can 

Recording: (3377/ 10721) 
so i almost bought one a couple weeks ago in fact i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man it was for his mother who was in her 90s i was on royal forest which is north and i made this low offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i have the baby coming and we are going to be busy and i did not want to get involved in it and so i made this offer and then he countered back 

Recording: (3378/ 10721) 
i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or what not it is i guess it is more because it is so different than like what you normally see or things like that 

Recording: (3379/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (3380/ 10721) 
i am telling you 

Recording: (3381/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3382/ 10721) 
no it is in the ag college but why it is there i do not know it is a matter of how they fit it in there but it is dealing with construction management 

Recording: (3383/ 10721) 
say people who are routed from their home or their office you know and are reminded to go vote will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and if you need a ride let me know we have got them set up for you 

Recording: (3384/ 10721) 
i went to ou for about three months but i just got out of school you know how it is 

Recording: (3385/ 10721) 
i think he really does 

Recording: (3386/ 10721) 
that is wrong for him to do that he you know he is a man and that would tell him god did not put two men on this earth and if he would choose to do that i would not hate them or disown them or anything like that 

Recording: (3387/ 10721) 
it really does not look like i mean 

Recording: (3388/ 10721) 
at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody 

Recording: (3389/ 10721) 
that is an embarrassment for a college this size 

Recording: (3390/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (3391/ 10721) 
and that the people who most face that lie are the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation so i mean civil rights was an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today there are i mean i see a growing movement of people who want to curtail the advances that were made in the 60s 

Recording: (3392/ 10721) 
um actually oddly enough that is what i am putting in 

Recording: (3393/ 10721) 
tess yeah 

Recording: (3394/ 10721) 
and now they have the little tiny grape tomatoes that are so cute have not you seen the size of grapes yeah they are darling

into the hilltop area 

Recording: (3398/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3399/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3400/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (3401/ 10721) 
i do not know because i have not kept in contact with them i know of a couple that have 

Recording: (3402/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3403/ 10721) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but but i still think they benefited a lot from it 

Recording: (3404/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah yeah so 

Recording: (3405/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3406/ 10721) 
but as i said i went to summer school too and 

Recording: (3407/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3408/ 10721) 
so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the he makes fairly decent money so she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild 

Recording: (3409/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (3410/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (3411/ 10721) 
you know there is things about my dad that i would not want to live with he is great and he is wonderful to me i mean my dad is really wonderful to me but i mean things like when my mom had me he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (3412/ 10721) 
yeah it is ridiculous plus it is a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize it because it is a big it is a big big name ashland it would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credited but still 

Recording: (3413/ 10721) 
i will place on some land with woods and yeah water things like that 

Recording: (3414/ 10721) 
right which is what we look like 

Recording: (3415/ 10721) 
if you did not own let us say on a school levy you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset and very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent at least it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord and i i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond of what the levy was so that would be the first thing 

Recording: (3416/ 10721) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (3417/ 10721) 
oh lots of people travel all over lots of people do they do shows on christmas if they had them but i do 10 12 12 a year 

Recording: (3418/ 10721) 
middle 

Recording: (3419/ 10721) 
well i do not know the people that i see around you know they are grownups 

Recording: (3420/ 10721) 
better than us i guess 

Recording: (3421/ 10721) 
i think that we both i think collectively together i know jason likes me a little bit better i do not know about boys names he said one when i was about three months that we both really liked but names were not really what we were thinking about them 

Recording: (3422/ 10721) 
but it just depends upon it still comes back to who you are now 

Recording: (3423/ 10721) 
a lot of pool actually we go to a bar called the outer inn because it is cheap and it is fun there 

Recording: (3424/ 10721) 
average was going to be ruined and she felt guilty about it not really not really i mean i was grading on it pretty much of a curve too i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was attempting to do the work i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off and but in terms of a curve i had a is i had bees i had a few c is yeah so 

Recording: (3425/ 10721) 
i feel funny that i am i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just is did not work out i was with his father for like nine years since i was 16 and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed so 

Recording: (3426/ 10721) 
yeah you follow the script that is real funny too they listen to you they monitor the calls you know they listen to you and it is like this sheet like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know said it in this way and like if you used this or whatever you know and like i do not know it is just real weird 

Recording: (3427/ 10721) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (3428/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3429/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (3430/ 10721) 
so yeah i think as a whole we have all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary i mean we do not have the same beliefs system and anything anymore so it is kind of like oh geez 

Recording: (3431/ 10721) 
expelling 

Recording: (3432/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3433/ 10721) 
well i am a meat eater so i make a lot of pork chop steaks and beef stew 

Recording: (3434/ 10721) 
so then the security cops were above us and they were predominantly black i do not know what happened something happened one time people in our whole platoon and it was all in the same barracks and some guy said something offcolor to one of them or something like that and it got kind of out of hand for a while but thank god nothing really happened 

Recording: (3435/ 10721) 
i forget they have way more than they dwarf any other state i think that to me is not that is not admirable that is one reason i would not vote for bush and i am sure you will be able to 

Recording: (3436/ 10721) 
get their pill at lunch generally the longacting the timereleased ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the timereleased and they only work for about 40 of the population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to do so they go back to the six hour dosage you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they are late to the lunch line and you know they just hate it you 

Recording: (3437/ 10721) 
he is white just a real down just look like he is from the ghetto just nasty guy 

Recording: (3438/ 10721) 
right i mean powell is booming and i think personally i could not have put him in daycare when he was an infant i think i would have quit if a family would not have been available but since family was available and i think he is very social i think he was ready for the interaction with the other kids and three days a week is not right 

Recording: (3439/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (3440/ 10721) 
and if i continue to do that for a long period of time i become very unpopular 

Recording: (3441/ 10721) 
i am not sure if i am going to be able to answer that you do not have a choice but at the same time you do not want them to suffer but you want to keep them it is whoops oops i hope i did not move 

Recording: (3442/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3443/ 10721) 
right you can not really ignore i have heard people say i refuse to read the dispatch well you gotta know what is going on locally i am sorry

Recording: (3446/ 10721) 
but when you look at coleman there was a point where they asked a yes or no question

you know why 

Recording: (3448/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah my mom are real close 

Recording: (3449/ 10721) 
well you have an urban area with a lot of poor children a lot of single parent families and just the population is changing period from the twoparent family the mother not working into one parent with the mother working it makes a big difference in how the child does at school 

Recording: (3450/ 10721) 
17 and 19 

Recording: (3451/ 10721) 
now that would go over well here would not it 

Recording: (3452/ 10721) 
yeah

Recording: (3599/ 10721) 
the bad places the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that that is had a lot to do with changing our younger generation in the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much profanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i got to do my own thing that is what when the i want to do my own thing started he says with the women is feminist movement but

Recording: (3604/ 10721) 
of different views on how things work but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything to overprotect

Recording: (3814/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season it is just 

Recording: (3815/ 10721) 
is it oh that is a good day

and he travels all over the state of ohio 

Recording: (3821/ 10721) 
i am not 

Recording: (3822/ 10721) 
uh i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that uh like said by no means my saying you go president clinton and i think that but i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (3823/ 10721) 
and people do not seem to understand that it is not like you are collecting data for the entire population or the entire universe you are working with a sample trying to represent the entire universe well sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not 

Recording: (3824/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3825/ 10721) 
right you gotta pick your battles right 

Recording: (3826/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3827/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (3828/ 10721) 
but i mean like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (3829/ 10721) 
i am and are out of control and i think that is sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high 

Recording: (3830/ 10721) 
so if you want to give me two more minutes to play okay now you got another leg but the thing is let me ask you a question how does that impact you if you can not be a priest are not there other important quoteunquote roles for women in the church church are not there other important roles 

Recording: (3831/ 10721) 
well i do not know how to explain that especially if anybody is going to listen to this i had a friend that told me i taught classes human potential classes was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement so a gentleman by the name of alexander evert who really is the father of the human potential movement moved out there 

Recording: (3832/ 10721) 
yeah 84 

Recording: (3833/ 10721) 
i always wish somebody would do a survey on that and say back in 65 or whatever what is the difference between what they are teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that it is just our imagination just do not remember enough yeah but it seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (3834/ 10721) 
i would 

Recording: (3835/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3836/ 10721) 
right moving that i do not think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have the culture is just so fast paced that i do not think people are maybe it is not honesty maybe it is just they do not have as much time to get attached and 

Recording: (3837/ 10721) 
we are all in columbus 

Recording: (3838/ 10721) 
do this 

Recording: (3839/ 10721) 
and you can lead a better life but janet just envelops them with her kindness and probably has less expectations from the people she works with 

Recording: (3840/ 10721) 
on tv and in the movies 

Recording: (3841/ 10721) 
and he said even when he was in high school they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people with knives and you would have people with fist fights but you like guns was unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it i did not feel that way but in retrospect i look back and i am thinking 

Recording: (3842/ 10721) 
to learn about god he does not know anything about god right now i do not think at all 

Recording: (3843/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3844/ 10721) 
oh yeah i think it is possible it would have to take the right combination of someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people i would have been heart pressed some of her issues i do not like but when she came out and said her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns she went up a couple of notches in my estimation because i was not sure where she would be i thought she would have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline republicans 

Recording: (3845/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3846/ 10721) 
of the medical school class which is 220 

Recording: (3847/ 10721)

Recording: (3849/ 10721) 
but i can certainly see that i think that a lot of people feel like too he is one of us he is like we are kind of thing well michigan it is a 10year mandatory jail time sentence if you get caught with any cocaine at all 

Recording: (3850/ 10721) 
and sooner or later all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (3851/ 10721) 
yeah he just used that raynex stuff 

Recording: (3852/ 10721) 
that was up to age 18 to or thereabout to i i think that the you said to get back to the very beginning of the bird and up to kindergarten and so forth that is the family i think that we in our educational program we 

Recording: (3853/ 10721) 
i mean obviously if someone is like 30 and they are gay i do not see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 

Recording: (3854/ 10721) 
well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and you know maybe pull these kids into more more of a group setting or something and give them more you know counseling professional you know counseling 

Recording: (3855/ 10721) 
and they went through their own training and everything we did not interface with each other or nothing like that i mean you might see one walking or marching somewhere as far as fraternizing you were not allowed to 

Recording: (3856/ 10721) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in 20 or 25 years or something like that he had killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a cop out if there ever was one just to get him a lethal injection and let him go he should have rotted in prison for it no that is not true 

Recording: (3857/ 10721)

you have to be a good example if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right things i think that is the best you can do for them

Recording: (3900/ 10721) 
that is not true i mean some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes 

Recording: (3901/ 10721) 
i just have not enjoyed it before then i was fine i made a mistake by playing for that one job i just wanted to get something different because i did not want to go back where i was i would have been better off back where i was i would have been better at the job for one thing and i knew the kind of insanity i would be dealing with there 

Recording: (3902/ 10721) 
i mean i could practically graduate already i have all the credits but then you have those required classes that you have to take 

Recording: (3903/ 10721) 
now 

Recording: (3904/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3905/ 10721) 
that is not right so i have always gotten 2 raises even though basically i have been cross trained or however you want to say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get 10 raises and i have seen me get 2 raise when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (3906/ 10721) 
they are but it seems like they are going out instead of having we do not do things in hotels and things because they have inhouse 

Recording: (3907/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3908/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3909/ 10721) 
that is awesome there is a lot of stuff to do down there if you like outdoors i bet 

Recording: (3910/ 10721) 
because apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i would do it right in front of their face and they would be like dude thanks 

Recording: (3911/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3912/ 10721) 
even they do not get facts right a lot of the time 

Recording: (3913/ 10721) 
like mostly because we had time but if you had time and money you would be able to do the tourist things 

Recording: (3914/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3915/ 10721) 
so he gives them a drug called welbutrin which is a i do not know like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for hiv adhd but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study 

Recording: (3916/ 10721) 
without going into too much detail one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church to here and learned a lot and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine and theological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he does not and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is a heretic he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours 

Recording: (3917/ 10721) 
no this is sherry 

Recording: (3918/ 10721) 
hide in your basement again and i mean you can 

Recording: (3919/ 10721) 
me i do not want to go to jail and get arrested because i feel i will not do my people any service by being in jail 

Recording: (3920/ 10721) 
just i think it is to reflect the beliefs that we are trying to carry and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i am not saying that it is terrible but if they had like a nose ring and all the stuff then somebody might not believe that they have anything credible to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more you 

Recording: (3921/ 10721) 
nobody oh she is really plain smart i mean 

Recording: (3922/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3923/ 10721) 
she went to school here till 91 actually so she was about the fourth grade just great 

Recording: (3924/ 10721) 
thank you 

Recording: (3925/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3926/ 10721) 
but it made a lot of people more rare 

Recording: (3927/ 10721) 
i think what they were protesting was that they were not being involved in it was not that part of their protest 

Recording: (3928/ 10721) 
oh yes they are getting better though they really are they are much better now than they were 20 years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible teachers are having to learn for example 

Recording: (3929/ 10721) 
teacher he works at a high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders no i do not think that at all i would be deceiving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about him i am just like oh my gosh i can not believe all of the 

Recording: (3930/ 10721) 
do you know what i mean 

Recording: (3931/ 10721) 
yeah one of my friend is cousins went to that fraternity i do not remember what the cause was of his death and that is pretty extreme to do but like i said it is something where people should know the risks of it and know what goes into it 

Recording: (3932/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (3933/ 10721) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (3934/ 10721)

Recording: (3937/ 10721) 
and i know that in my case i will use a personal case i will use frank my older son the ones i am speaking of the one the boy is going on 17 the one little girl just turned 11 the other one turned 8 well they go over to the one grandparent is house and she has a habit of paying them for little jobs they do around the house so consequently when they come to my house 

Recording: (3938/ 10721) 
and as a way i put it it is kind of new agey and i do not like new agey stuff but you know it is the best example is moths from the dark when you flip on a light the moths will go right to it a child like that a young man like that is very impressionable very young still and these bad spirits the spirits will be flocked right to him 

Recording: (3939/ 10721) 
we are getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it is still got way too much cow town personality 

Recording: (3940/ 10721)

Recording: (3941/ 10721) 
because i have seen a lot of bad parents i have seen a lot of bad people you know what i mean i have seen people you know you always hear about drugs and all that i have seen people sitting there drinking

yeah i was in the sales department through telephone marketing it was actual sales that i was doing i was there for 15 years 

Recording: (3944/ 10721) 
but the professors seem more centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you can not diminish all your bottom line for making your work your show feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (3945/ 10721) 
it is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago 

Recording: (3946/ 10721)

not if he would been as open about it as he was here clinton did that also and thought he would be able to segregate or not segregate desegregate the military and fan out with his first action as president there is a strong backlash against that at least nationwide and in the military but i thought it was the right stance

when you conceive with somebody else is sperm or somebody else is whatever because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child here that needs help and here again you are reaching out to your friend your neighbor you are not just forgetting about him and let the welfare or somebody take care of him and let him go down the drain and i think that that that is what adoption is and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is love and when you are trying and willing to have well some people probably

because they are saying you are still a kid but yet

well a long time ago when they signed the declaration and everything they said you know build a fence around your place and take care of your own you know i think basically that is the way the philosophy should be i think there is times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman 

Recording: (4177/ 10721) 
thing i really think that that is most of it i do not know how people i got a letter the other day and i can not remember the name of the personality that was doing it but he is sending out these things about how you can sign up to take a right in and say do not have these kind of tv programs on anymore where they use the profanity where they use the drinking where they use the dope and were the use of vulgarity and i understand this thing about him being a

something that truly hurt injured not today however i suspect my mom could easily be could have been charged with abuse child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that green sweat it was always a green switch because the old ones they would break you do not want to write break 

Recording: (4187/ 10721) 
or does this say this this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and whether they travel in groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that 

Recording: (4188/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4189/ 10721)

Recording: (4192/ 10721) 
i know people that sleep outside and not all of them are veterans and everything but there again they do not want to be a part of the quoteunquote sheltered system you know staying in an open shelter voa or something like that 

Recording: (4193/ 10721) 
yeah we could actually use the granview library they have a really good library there large selection of videos and they have story time things where they read to the kids get them interested in books and different type of things where you can win things for reading amount of books 

Recording: (4194/ 10721) 
i hear in new york city where it is a lot more populated it is getting real bad of course you probably know about that 

Recording: (4195/ 10721) 
just general things that i think you should take for granted 

Recording: (4196/ 10721) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (4197/ 10721) 
yeah we have kind of broken her of that thank goodness the counter stuff 

Recording: (4198/ 10721) 
this is weird 

Recording: (4199/ 10721) 
to learn about the sweats there are some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges which you are not supposed to do they show step by step how to build one tell you what some kind of wood to build it out of and 90 of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood there is a way to do it and there is a way to do it it has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that because the people of this land were given specific 

Recording: (4200/ 10721) 
i met her in high school she is still in high school and i am in college 

Recording: (4201/ 10721) 
knew the first day he was in here he knew everything that i was going to teach this grading period well that kind of flew up a red flag to me can you give him other assignments oh no he is got do whatever else is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the parents advisory committee at the time so i had easy access to the principal he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked with him oneonone teaching database and spreadsheet applications to him 

Recording: (4202/ 10721) 
definitely 

Recording: (4203/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (4204/ 10721) 
you know what kind of an answer is that even if your answer is i do not know why you can not do it it just makes me uncomfortable you know that is a lot more fair than because i am the boss of you or something like that and i think if you respect your kids and just kind of set boundaries with them you know kind of try to be i do not know that is the way my family family is eyes been and it always seems to work really well for us 

Recording: (4205/ 10721) 
não 

Recording: (4206/ 10721) 
yeah it is i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is let is see what was my decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do it for me 

Recording: (4207/ 10721) 
no no not at all she is not watching ashland 

Recording: (4208/ 10721) 
and none of the animals they profiled were pets i mean a 36 foot long python what the hell is a person doing with that as a pet and they should not be allowed to and then people treating a buffalo like they could stand next to it and take a family picture 

Recording: (4209/ 10721) 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4210/ 10721) 
so that is mainly probably more for fishing 

Recording: (4211/ 10721) 
down 

Recording: (4212/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (4213/ 10721) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (4214/ 10721) 
but if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not going to let him get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i try to teach you different out where you went wrong i do not want to did wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty so 

Recording: (4215/ 10721) 
they find out a way to get to him i dated a guy where we came in on his little brother and he was loading the bullets in the gun and he had them totally separate like that kids know and they are curious i do not know i mean i am not for guns because i have they the guns do not scare me the people scare me so no unless they have them in a safe or something 

Recording: (4216/ 10721) 
conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4217/ 10721) 
that is when you take him to grimoire yeah that is what we do he is got to go grimoire night but we live with my mom and dad so he gets to see my side all the time but he does not get to see them as much so it is like when that night comes on go to grandma or like we take to him to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets those free 

Recording: (4218/ 10721) 
oh i know they do not care they got money people goddamn 

Recording: (4219/ 10721) 
the birth control issue became so personal and it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with what i felt was clear conscience in what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (4220/ 10721) 
i guess i am also sure i wish they would celebrate every holiday so then they are exposed to all of it instead of none of it 

Recording: (4221/ 10721) 
catholic high schools but even there you know there was you know a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not have been going on and that was only on a very small level there were 86 people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students that this happened at 

Recording: (4222/ 10721) 
are growing up we push all this and then expect them to deal with it and they see tv shows and everything else that it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and wait till those people 

Recording: (4223/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (4224/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (4225/ 10721) 
i think there is been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think even though i would hope there was a better way to handle it i think they did the right thing by taking him away from me from the cousins i mean the cousins have been stressing how long he needs family he needs family well there is a much closer family than your father and they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you agree with them or not 

Recording: (4226/ 10721) 
so he will not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4227/ 10721) 
that is probably what i will do ignore it until like august or july and then start paying attention 

Recording: (4228/ 10721) 
an example of that i asked my manager the other day she told me i was supposed to do this certain thing and i asked her i said well they told me i was not supposed to 

Recording: (4229/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4230/ 10721) 
is that right 

Recording: (4231/ 10721) 
i lived i actually went there for interior design i lived right off the street 

Recording: (4232/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (4233/ 10721) 
it is very hard i mean i missed a lot of school i mean most people would think that i have a lot of help but i really do not i mean i live with my parents and everything and i mean they have jobs too it is not like they are 

Recording: (4234/ 10721) 
although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people praying and they are praying with their heart and i tell you because of how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart not a bunch of real fancy words in a real comfortable setting you know that he 

Recording: (4235/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4236/ 10721) 
i have not personally researched it but i have seen i would personally research it if i was president documentaries and what because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv that three strikes and you are out has really seemed to work in california because 

Recording: (4237/ 10721) 
yeah stops in front of my house 

Recording: (4238/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (4239/ 10721) 
things you know collecting but it is hard with my sister is cats because she has a little girl and no she did not go home vacuum every day you know but 

Recording: (4240/ 10721) 
they really have no selfworth because you know i know a long time ago we went to a what was that it is like a seminar for the ivy league school which i looked at their tuition and went ah you know there was no way but and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever they said you know if your child makes straight a is and applies at our school we do not want 

Recording: (4241/ 10721) 
one of them is working over here on the stadium 

Recording: (4242/ 10721) 
and there is like nothing in it and you know it is like go down the list that is what i do he just thinks i automatically know i am a mind reader that is what it is 

Recording: (4243/ 10721) 
i hope so yeah 

Recording: (4244/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4245/ 10721) 
well i think in my opinion i think mainly it is the absence of basically parenting my mom was there she was a housewife you know and so she was she went to work after my i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother all my brothers and sisters are already graduated you know so 

Recording: (4246/ 10721) 
i do not think that changed my mind about anything i mean i do not approve of his immoral behavior but it does not change my mind the way he runs the country 

Recording: (4247/ 10721) 
i did get better grades last nine weeks did not i well is not that amazing you were taking your pills then some connection here so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let us just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we will write them down and say oh well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all this nine weeks you have not been able to focus on that maybe medicine does help you some maybe you are just you know not giving it credit 

Recording: (4248/ 10721) 
yeah i mean like it just it provides a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 

Recording: (4249/ 10721) 
the snuffer and all that 

Recording: (4250/ 10721) 
you know we really do not know much about his life away from home 

Recording: (4251/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (4252/ 10721) 
there you go 

Recording: (4253/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4254/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4255/ 10721) 
well not really they have a lot of religious beliefs on their own that they have held on to because they just have had nothing 

Recording: (4256/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4257/ 10721) 
sorry 

Recording: (4258/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4259/ 10721) 
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (4260/ 10721) 
i have become visually desensitized to the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that that still are very i still find disturbing also hang out in little life 

Recording: (4261/ 10721) 
i think that step would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4262/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (4263/ 10721) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (4264/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4265/ 10721) 
it cause any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (4266/ 10721) 
and no oh did they 

Recording: (4267/ 10721) 
and finally i do not know whetherwe had a piper cub observation plane i do not know whether he saw him or who but anyway they finally figured that he was in a tunnel for the railroad 

Recording: (4268/ 10721) 
the only thing i am going to do is maybe two weeks before i might get $100 from the bank machine i have three cars so i probably have one of them full of gas other than that it is like you know to me if you are say bank one and i am huntington and january the 2nd people have all kinds problems you and i are going to be the laughingstock of the corporate america and you really think you and i want to do that so to me nobody is gonna have a problem because years they are gonna go 

Recording: (4269/ 10721) 
professors and everything but i think you know they get a lot of these kids and they do not care about school but they leave early because they know they can do it 

Recording: (4270/ 10721) 
and you know it is oh you have got art we are open to that you know 

Recording: (4271/ 10721) 
well it is like the 

Recording: (4272/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4273/ 10721) 
and it was in the butt do not get me wrong he told me he was gonna have me locked up for child abuse so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown and took him inside and told him to tell them people because they are gonna lock him up 

Recording: (4274/ 10721) 
you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is 22 i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to look for a pervert you need to look for and what you need to check out and you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a workstudy job you know 

Recording: (4275/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (4276/ 10721) 
poor people can not do that so after all of a sudden with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that million the attorney and the firm got a third plus you had to pay office expenses so really she was probably left with only about $300000 which if used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person but a very stupid person 

Recording: (4277/ 10721) 
$21 million check to hit the doorstep you know 

Recording: (4278/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (4279/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4280/ 10721) 
you do not tell me what to do i said well okay you want to call me back well do a blanket or something like that think she called me ended up calling back a couple three hours later i was pissed i would not talk to her you know little childish things i will pay you back you know 

Recording: (4281/ 10721) 
that is like 25 or 30 an hour 

Recording: (4282/ 10721) 
well that is good that is exciting 

Recording: (4283/ 10721) 
and there is all kinds of things going on i mean if you had the money you could do something every night 

Recording: (4284/ 10721) 
then they were raised then they are but i told her i will never be married if my man is gonna be cheating on me i will not marry him 

Recording: (4285/ 10721) 
i know well you get to take advantage of it for layovers and stuff 

Recording: (4286/ 10721) 
what would they have to gain 

Recording: (4287/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4288/ 10721) 
a place for computers that my plants sit in the corner and then have my little paper stack 

Recording: (4289/ 10721) 
i mean 

Recording: (4290/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4291/ 10721) 
you and a lot of these people were the dogs were reacting and they were objective you know and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and chewing things up 

Recording: (4292/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4293/ 10721) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these 15 murders or so since 1991 on the east side and then you got all these people you know i have been in the fights in my neighborhood and well my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your shit stuff and just all out outlandish behavior i mean i caught i actually wrote up on a couple people 

Recording: (4294/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4295/ 10721) 
yeah she still lives with family 

Recording: (4296/ 10721) 
mmhmm

no no

Recording: (4582/ 10721) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing

well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (4584/ 10721) 
or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but it if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save half of them it is better than mbc 뉴스 김수진입니다

well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be doing illegal things to get guns 

Recording: (4612/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (4613/ 10721) 
crossdressing cross personality homosexual oh okay gay whatever term sir i do not know where the children ever picked up but i am sure that they were not born that way because there is been a lot of them who have been married i had kids and i had no one and then when he got the divorce i do not know why he changed his mind and started living with the guys age

Recording: (4620/ 10721) 
yeah i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (4621/ 10721)

Recording: (4622/ 10721)

Recording: (4623/ 10721) 
you know before they tell you this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach they are telling you about the surfboard that they got and how great they surfed when that really should come down in the body of the paper most people just assume the reader knows i always say to my kids pretend like you are writing for an alien 

Recording: (4624/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (4625/ 10721) 
well that is the problem i think 

Recording: (4626/ 10721) 
no i have had friends go i was gonna go to one on halloween but did not 

Recording: (4627/ 10721) 
so it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with people that are into capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they do not seem to have such serious problems so people who try to go against that current can get themselves into big trouble so and capitalism has made the united states go 

Recording: (4628/ 10721) 
going to come back and salvage the world all the good people will be here and probably the bad people maybe he will take the good people and make it a better world for us and the rest of them will suddenly die i do not know 

Recording: (4629/ 10721) 
i think so although she was working at her desk most of the time so that she did not give them as much attention as 

Recording: (4630/ 10721) 
about two and a half years ago 

Recording: (4631/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4632/ 10721) 
were with that child 

Recording: (4633/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4634/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (4635/ 10721) 
for people to read i think there is enough other resources out there if somebody is interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that i know for me just because i have so many younger brothers and sisters and my family and everything i know i have got some pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i know that my mom always consults me you know like my sister you know she got a d in french which vanessa is just she is this girl is almost creepy she is so 

Recording: (4636/ 10721) 
did you really you went maybe even to their ward that is funny they are the f not that you would know them 

Recording: (4637/ 10721) 
both today i was farmed out to bank 1 yesterday was monday i was farmed out to bank 1 friday farmed out to bank 1 but now i have resolved all those three issues and they do not have anything else to throw at me interesting so i am leaving tomorrow i will be back at the home office working on some other stuff that will benefit us in franchising because franchising is a much better way to make money than selling time for money selling time for money sucks 

Recording: (4638/ 10721) 
well obviously i sort of surmounted that because i have spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then after that you just sort of get to the point where you just kind of laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then 

Recording: (4639/ 10721) 
and in the winter they build big bonfires out there where the casting ponds was they let you skate they have big bonfires when you are done skating 

Recording: (4640/ 10721)

Recording: (4641/ 10721) 
and she can be called tam 

Recording: (4642/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4643/ 10721) 
yeah it is like i do not know they used to have something called exploring posts that were directly related venturing kind of took over for that like still in boy scouts and then exploring went off on its own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they allowed like homosexuality with the leaders and all that so it is i do not know we call it like hippie boy scouts 

Recording: (4644/ 10721) 
yeah because they go back in three days 

Recording: (4645/ 10721) 
oh there was a lot of discouraging things i mean i learned so much and it was not always just people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times 

Recording: (4646/ 10721) 
really i had not heard that some of it when clinton is back down i think i sort of summarized what i just said is for the health insurance and reform of that bill insurance he backed down but it was not going to happen so he could keep the führer going for 

Recording: (4647/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4648/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4649/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (4650/ 10721) 
switch kids 

Recording: (4651/ 10721) 
his speed was like say 70 miles an hour before and now it is going to be 20 because he does not know how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and you know everything but now they have got to do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower 

Recording: (4652/ 10721) 
you know he was in oh yeah they both worked during college i guess my dad was on the gi bill after the war so that is how he got in here and had to work some parttime work to get his degree it is just east broad street just franklin park conservative 

Recording: (4653/ 10721) 
again with the news reports with the different bombings and i think the jewish school caught my attention and now that he is in daycare i mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always kind of wonder what is going on he is done quite well he is i mean he is learned how to use scissors how to color he is socially learning how to play with other kids those were all things he was not doing at home potty training is been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it 

Recording: (4654/ 10721) 
where they can go every day the way i look at it also too when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was 14 you can not even find a job unless you are 16 nowadays 

Recording: (4655/ 10721) 
not only with us the children but just to other people also you know how mother used to feed the bums that would come out the front door and she would fix some food and so she was a very 

Recording: (4656/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (4657/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (4658/ 10721) 
prebargained or 

Recording: (4659/ 10721) 
well you are in a hightech society most people you said you are from new york right your family is where 

Recording: (4660/ 10721) 
it is really beautiful out there we like mountains and walking around we got married in lake tahoe which is really beautiful 

Recording: (4661/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4662/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4663/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4664/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (4665/ 10721) 
not for long 

Recording: (4666/ 10721) 
but the writing they give you one point for each paragraph so you have to get five points to pass now you might get four out of five and almost most paths and then you have to retake that one part 

Recording: (4667/ 10721) 
yeah teach one person one thing and not teach the other person that let me see here i will give an example there is a school that they showed on 2020 somewhere out west i believe it is nevada or somewhere and they said that these teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation 

Recording: (4668/ 10721) 
oh she is cute she really is really cute i mean i mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks 

Recording: (4669/ 10721) 
or so 

Recording: (4670/ 10721) 
i am on my ninth manager 

Recording: (4671/ 10721) 
yeah there is like people calling and talk about other like they saw it in this other our mailorder catalog that i have never heard of either it is i do not know how really they do it like it is just like they get people is names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and people call back or whatever 

Recording: (4672/ 10721) 
oh i know it is so much fun 

Recording: (4673/ 10721) 
i do not know i do not know i am sure it would happen because there is all kinds of wacky people out there seriously i do not know i have family members that are homosexual that is just my own personal thing beliefs i do not know i think that is they should not have taken it off of the dms whatever it was i do not know 

Recording: (4674/ 10721) 
no they are all boys 

Recording: (4675/ 10721) 
they could have taken other well they killed all these people off but they could have put them into the background had them do a couple of shows a season and then had the adventures of agent spender and what is her name but then they they killed off all those supporting former xfiles associated people 

Recording: (4676/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (4677/ 10721) 
i think it would 

Recording: (4678/ 10721) 
i can not think too much of them right now but 

Recording: (4679/ 10721) 
yeah but i have got more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (4680/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4681/ 10721) 
you better call the north shop 

Recording: (4682/ 10721) 
people can not understand 

Recording: (4683/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (4684/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (4685/ 10721) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay on that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that i had i might have stayed home there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work 

Recording: (4686/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4687/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4688/ 10721) 
if you would take all of the votes you won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per precinct one vote per precinct to decided by one or two votes when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two 

Recording: (4689/ 10721) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you would have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (4690/ 10721) 
hit the mark sometimes so he gets to clean the toilet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (4691/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4692/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (4693/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4694/ 10721) 
would be interested in i mean not just for the kids sake but would be interested on their own behalf in teaching the child what 

Recording: (4695/ 10721) 
they were actually able to select a couple they talked to a lawyer who arranges the options and she had a file and they threw a bunch of questions and answers type things were able to limit to three couples and they liked the first couple they met 

Recording: (4696/ 10721) 
just kind of move there a little bit there you go i got out of the service my parents were older and kind of felt an obligation to be around them to help take care of them 

Recording: (4697/ 10721) 
i mean i was very good in math very good in math i mean i did pretty good in all of the subjects chicks 

Recording: (4698/ 10721) 
but it does not always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the guy that they executed here in ohio last fall did you know about it 

Recording: (4699/ 10721) 
that they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peers opinions because i for one example the pokemon craze my son did not know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know 

Recording: (4700/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (4701/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (4702/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4703/ 10721) 
definitely it would be nice but no 

Recording: (4704/ 10721) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4705/ 10721) 
i keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids will be young i am a five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking 11 years so 

Recording: (4706/ 10721) 
yeah and he is got control over that because i mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman that babysits and she did very very well she did all that stuff that i would like to be done she took them to the library she had nap time at a certain time they were you know laid down and it is just totally different the grandmothers 

Recording: (4707/ 10721) 
so it probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (4708/ 10721) 
you know and i just thought i just do not i just do not like this is not so is this something that when i look long term is this something that i want to deal with for the rest of my life and i said no it just does not you know and i think that you have to to look at and see if you are compatible with somebody before you know people get into situations and they marry people that you just from the outside you can look and you can think are you nuts you know that is never going to work so i think that you just kind of have to take into consideration you know are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to work and be positive okay 

Recording: (4709/ 10721) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (4710/ 10721) 
i would find that hard to believe 

Recording: (4711/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4712/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4713/ 10721) 
i would say of i think the vva generally sees on the average 5 7 10 something like that a day now not all of them are homeless 

Recording: (4714/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (4715/ 10721) 
she said that it is like i do not know some people who work there like i could not imagine working complete nights you know i mean i like working 23 211 i think i would rather work like maybe like noon to eight that would be better because then it is like i mean i am more toned to staying up late anyways because of like how it is or whatever but like i do not want to have to get up really early either like i can never imagine having a ninetofive job like that would be horrible 

Recording: (4716/ 10721) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (4717/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4718/ 10721) 
the government is always good for money 

Recording: (4719/ 10721) 
yes but it was interesting they did have assemblies where they had religious assemblies religion was not all invasive in this school but they did have assemblies and for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking it is 

Recording: (4720/ 10721) 
but yeah it is a similar situation to being involved in a car accident but i could say i said she part part thinks the same way now she would been here you know and have trouble with boys and everything you know when she is growing up and i probably would have could have probably would have been an ass about that kind of stuff depending on how bad 

Recording: (4721/ 10721) 
it is a pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part not so much the getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (4722/ 10721) 
well we were in vancouver so it is not that far away we did not hear about it for a couple days but i heard that that is all that was on every aspect of his life every aspect of the search but do people really need to know that do they need to have a driven home and i think at that point that is where the media their sensation and 

Recording: (4723/ 10721) 
to the other side 

Recording: (4724/ 10721) 
is a law that you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me for so i came back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but i know the territory i know where i am going you 

Recording: (4725/ 10721) 
no i think i thrive on stress i think it keeps me going or something but i do have to do something that is accomplishing i do not want to sit in an office i have already done that day in and day out working for other people that i do not even approve of that are making way too much money anyway and after 

Recording: (4726/ 10721) 
okay i have two students well one is a student here currently 

Recording: (4727/ 10721) 
and then on out and the enemy was over there well they put us in the front of that mountain right down there 

Recording: (4728/ 10721) 
like you know 

Recording: (4729/ 10721) 
i make little side bets not necessarily money you know just haha for fun sometimes i did get money for it though it was not too bad i mean you know it is not like some kind of racketeering deal 

Recording: (4730/ 10721) 
ah they seem to 

Recording: (4731/ 10721) 
is it hard to keep up with her 

Recording: (4732/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4733/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4734/ 10721) 
i started at the real bottom of it 

Recording: (4735/ 10721) 
the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (4736/ 10721) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like 8 to 12 and then you go home during lunchtime because that is the big meal of the day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (4737/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (4738/ 10721) 
ew 

Recording: (4739/ 10721) 
clintonville 

Recording: (4740/ 10721) 
in la and then over the next two three years my sister comes back and forth no actually i lived here for several months i lived there for several months 

Recording: (4741/ 10721) 
i did have a white kid my son live in there and that is about it 

Recording: (4742/ 10721) 
i am not built that way 

Recording: (4743/ 10721) 
and i do not know commons i did not miss bus service i kind of missed because aaron is car is out on west campus but i went home and got my dad is apas he teaches in the dental school but he only teaches on fridays so he has that apas available all the time so our car is parked right next to the building 

Recording: (4744/ 10721) 
not so much when i was teaching it because i think 

Recording: (4745/ 10721) 
they were helping out the new guys 

Recording: (4746/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4747/ 10721) 
they were the majority huh 

Recording: (4748/ 10721) 
yeah it is true and she likes it she is really good at it and drives my stepdad crazy because she will always be like hey pete can you come over and put these cabinets in i do anything else but um 

Recording: (4749/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4750/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (4751/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4752/ 10721) 
okay let us go 

Recording: (4753/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4754/ 10721) 
to approximately a thousand which his son is mainly operating yet he goes out and works too helps out at this age but he is concerned because they have just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developers to come in and and already they are ready to take over a couple of farms that are fairly close to him but it affects the whole township 

Recording: (4755/ 10721) 
you puke up 

Recording: (4756/ 10721) 
which was the purpose of his book i suppose 

Recording: (4757/ 10721) 
and although that is trans meridian we go write that down because i do not know that name you know so 

Recording: (4758/ 10721) 
intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character in a person to bring about the spirituality and a person that is going to carry them all through life she is also tithing more than tithing probably which i always i said the author said 10 tithing knew inflation he knew great about economics 10 is 10 

Recording: (4759/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (4760/ 10721) 
well i think it really still goes back to the mom and the dad and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy act this way would that make my mom and dad happy because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff they learn by watching you do it too 

Recording: (4761/ 10721) 
actually i live in clintonville now and it is real convenient but the houses are so old and i am just tired of living in an old house 

Recording: (4762/ 10721)

objectives because when we went into the service and then went overseas our objective was do away with hitler and mussolini i am just thankful that he was not carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something 

Recording: (4768/ 10721) 
yeah things that are like simple chord changes and you can just fool around with on them and stuff 

Recording: (4769/ 10721) 
his my boyfriend is aunt and uncle their kid has that really hyperness 

Recording: (4770/ 10721)

Recording: (4779/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (4780/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (4781/ 10721) 
so you knew you have heard about that probably 

Recording: (4782/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (4783/ 10721) 
what is bad about where i work at it is not so much racism as whereas if you are my supervisor using this example and i would do something wrong 

Recording: (4784/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4785/ 10721) 
oh my god 

Recording: (4786/ 10721) 
that is going to be a problem they said bring water they have no dress code which is nice so i am just going to wear shorts some good walking shoes and a tshirt because it could get rough it can get real rough i bet 

Recording: (4787/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4788/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4789/ 10721) 
i think it would help i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people 

Recording: (4790/ 10721) 
i was raised 

Recording: (4791/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4792/ 10721) 
she always had these spiral notebooks and she would stop and get an idea for a poem from something she was working on i do not know what but anyway she wrote quite a few poems some of them real good poems i thought most of them of more or less a religious nature and moral nature 

Recording: (4793/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (4794/ 10721) 
so she is doing that 

Recording: (4795/ 10721) 
yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4796/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (4797/ 10721) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they would probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they would probably be exposed to you know the gay lesbian i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i do not know our friends that have an 11 year old that is going to public school i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (4798/ 10721) 
none at all he is always had very definite opinions of how his life should be 

Recording: (4799/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4800/ 10721) 
to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so i did not want to go into law did not want to go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept pounding me and telling me you know maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like why would i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a liar i bring him out 

Recording: (4801/ 10721) 
like 

Recording: (4802/ 10721) 
you do 

Recording: (4803/ 10721) 
us so i do not know i think a lot of it is the family unit breaking down in general you know and secondly i think to be honest i think the media has gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it they are going to get recognized they are going to have their name go down in history unfortunately i think that has something to do with it too it is frustrating to 

Recording: (4804/ 10721) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (4805/ 10721) 
i see i mean you see the computer can not be wrong he said 

Recording: (4806/ 10721) 
too much 

Recording: (4807/ 10721) 
no we actually had student tickets that people did not want clear up on c deck but we enjoy it because a lot of times we walk 

Recording: (4808/ 10721) 
oh because some of the newer jets there is like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it is there are prop planes that are like five times as noisy 

Recording: (4809/ 10721) 
and then a couple years later he was working on a job in the columbus coated fabrics plant that makes coated fabrics the main thing is auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and those fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (4810/ 10721) 
yeah you gotta remember it was all swamps back when i was a kid like i said i grew up down here it was mostly farmlands when i grew up around here 

Recording: (4811/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4812/ 10721) 
some of them are athletes they are pretty much just preppy student council i am good at school but bad outside of school they go out and party outside but they join all like the students against drugs programs 

Recording: (4813/ 10721) 
now i have not been over there since then 

Recording: (4814/ 10721) 
it is like you know yeah like a hundred hours a window in one week oh man 

Recording: (4815/ 10721) 
it is a good place they even stopped playing the ghetto music they have this jukebox and it was horrible they played the same three songs with horribly offensive lyrics and no melody whatsoever whatsoever 

Recording: (4816/ 10721) 
for me personally family being close both sides of the family are here for me familiarity i do not like a lot of change a lot of new things for me i was involved in i swam for osu swimming and got real involved with the osu sports and just the sports sporting programs and i love ohio state football so i like the sports there are a lot of activities to do too now with my little boy going to kosai and the zoo 

Recording: (4817/ 10721)

Recording: (4818/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4819/ 10721) 
back in the early 70s and then i transferred to worthington in 76 and i have been there ever since 

Recording: (4820/ 10721) 
i bet yeah 

Recording: (4821/ 10721) 
yeah he is yeah he is 26 

Recording: (4822/ 10721) 
yeah exactly that will solve the problem 

Recording: (4823/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4824/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4825/ 10721) 
they have specific programs for the children i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that if a kid has bad behavior or a bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying hot wiring 

Recording: (4826/ 10721) 
oh wow 

Recording: (4827/ 10721) 
okay i am thinking people who backpack are pretty cool 

Recording: (4828/ 10721) 
oh yeah they showed they cut open this pulling this baby out of this little hole of this lady is stomach and i just i had heart surgery when i was younger and so i have had lots of needles and those types of things and when it comes to needles and that kind of stuff i am just kind of squeamish about it so that stuff i just do not want to see it 

Recording: (4829/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4830/ 10721) 
of the year i mean it just got to the point where i would had enough and i did not want to go anymore 

Recording: (4831/ 10721) 
but right now with his attitude the way it is i would say that me and my family are better off not having him stirring up a bunch of conflict or whatever 

Recording: (4832/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4833/ 10721) 
yum 

Recording: (4834/ 10721) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school because there were pregnant girls in my high school you 

Recording: (4835/ 10721) 
and well actually a neighbor boy whose draft number was smaller than mine 

Recording: (4836/ 10721) 
geez something does not sound right through the airways or through the writing something is mysterious going on here and he found out they were having difficulties well divorce became acceptable before it was a nono now it is acceptable and then you had the celebrities becoming more notable oh hey we do not get married then we have the idea of doing away with cash gold metallic backing 

Recording: (4837/ 10721) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (4838/ 10721) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know a pregnancy here and there things that people needed to get worked out or someone being worried about a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do about it so yeah but you know i it is i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (4839/ 10721) 
okay one two three four five testing testing when i was the kid my father got this tapered car in the days when they were those big you know the wheels 

Recording: (4840/ 10721) 
are not you holding it 

Recording: (4841/ 10721) 
well that is what everybody when i tell people i play it that is what everybody says but it seems to me that any instrument can be hard depending i mean i can not see how anybody can play a clarinet for example but there are some things that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with the single fingering 

Recording: (4842/ 10721) 
and you uh it is just like the game battleship pretty much you know a four a two a seven and uh well for three dollar one of one probably four out of five you know in that i have not bought that many of them but in that race right there four out of five is not too bad i got my mom one on her birthday she got $15 and you 

Recording: (4843/ 10721) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (4844/ 10721) 
i when you are little is when i think you learn loyalty i love the old detroit tigers from the 80s that is when i learned to like 

Recording: (4845/ 10721) 
yeah if it is a nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (4846/ 10721) 
so he is going to be somebody who can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because 

Recording: (4847/ 10721) 
and they can not find it and you are like alright alright look on the catalog where it says mem number that would be your membership number and people are like oh alright alright but i do not know like i i really want to get a job that is in a warehouse or something something really easy where i can just load boxes or something never have time to really i mean like i try and do like can i try and do yoga but it is like we work to 32 11 so it is like by the time you get home it is 

Recording: (4848/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4849/ 10721) 
i mean i do not know enough about it to really say but i can not i mean i do not know where they got that 

Recording: (4850/ 10721) 
she was but i admired her more because until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going to be the litmus test it was just like back in the 60s and the 70s when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party they would nominate such people as mcgovern who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hardline left 

Recording: (4851/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4852/ 10721) 
but our belief is that it needed to be restored and we believe i do not know if you have heard about joseph smith or 

Recording: (4853/ 10721) 
sure um i grew up in lima ohio and which is only about an hour and a half from here north i came here in 1991 i believe here being columbus i got married about three years ago and right now i am in the process of doing a little bit of everything i have worked all my life i have been doing this for about two years i have been working parttime and doing crafts

no 

Recording: (4855/ 10721) 
them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they are doing 

Recording: (4856/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4857/ 10721) 
inadequate but that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you go to special conferences to get information on that 

Recording: (4858/ 10721) 
you hitting on me get the hell away 

Recording: (4859/ 10721) 
it all gets i do not know it all works itself out every other day you start him on taxes and he will just start fuming 

Recording: (4860/ 10721) 
kids start dressing and getting in a clique together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that is that is not really should be their role but if they care enough they should call the parents and say look we are worried about your son he misses a lot of school or he is starting to dress really you know sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress 

Recording: (4861/ 10721) 
double a major 

Recording: (4862/ 10721) 
ok so he got expelled from catholic school for behavior problems 

Recording: (4863/ 10721) 
do your thing 

Recording: (4864/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4865/ 10721) 
not really i mean i do not think they would come to any more difficult conclusions than guys had coming up to 

Recording: (4866/ 10721) 
helps the curve 

Recording: (4867/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4868/ 10721) 
i do not know those kids lacked something in their upbringing and i do not know what it is thank goodness none of my kids ever took that sort of attitude and i would like to think that my wife and i set them a good example you 

Recording: (4869/ 10721) 
yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of med school get your phd and then do your last two years of med school 

Recording: (4870/ 10721) 
so we walked across the street to the church 

Recording: (4871/ 10721) 
he is 

Recording: (4872/ 10721) 
they are also talking about the actors the reason they are ending it is because i think that is a really important point the character development is the most important part i think so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that they are going to leave things kind of open 

Recording: (4873/ 10721) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway but i am not sure i would trust myself because there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much yeah yeah 

Recording: (4874/ 10721) 
nah 

Recording: (4875/ 10721) 
so they knew that this bush name would bring out a lot of money which it has he is got a lot of money to work with and you know that does not seem fair either there i do not think the average person in the united states the average person does not think that your policy politicians should be bought you know 

Recording: (4876/ 10721) 
yeah i guess i just have the nerve to scratch and stuff like my rings i will twist them because they bother me like i do not wear this all a lot it is one of the days i did 

Recording: (4877/ 10721) 
disability and i have different abilities now same abilities i used to do but i have to do them a different way just because my brain functions on a different level and i can not explain that to anybody and i should not have to but i am always forced to but trying to find a job you know resulting from this has been difficult and that is you know 

Recording: (4878/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4879/ 10721) 
but he would bring in a nutritionalist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (4880/ 10721) 
desert 

Recording: (4881/ 10721) 
that is the grocery we use yeah 

Recording: (4882/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4883/ 10721) 
so he did it well he is always had some problems his problem i am saying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can not get him away from it if it is something he it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or it is working on a writing assignment or something they have a half hour to work on a 

Recording: (4884/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4885/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (4886/ 10721) 
a hunter and everything you know i knew it when you shot something that died it was not it was not a game you know and i would hate to think that that would cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody else shoot another human being i mean that does not i do not even know why there should be any concern for it 

Recording: (4887/ 10721) 
he was on kp one day and he said they had a big an area out away from any of the other buildings where they burned trash and that sort of stuff so he said the mess sergeant said should we make our ticket of trash out and burn it you probably better just take some gasoline to throw on the stuff to get it to burn 

Recording: (4888/ 10721) 
run quick put plastic on oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is a very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of auto workers you think of pipe fitters you do not think of such a wide variety of 

Recording: (4889/ 10721) 
it is kind of frustrating but it is probably good for me because it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to believe you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me look at it that way just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (4890/ 10721) 
yeah

he is the one jelling in their house and he is the one cursing and causing all the ruckus 

Recording: (4892/ 10721) 
oh my sister is particularly religious and that tends to warp her view of everything 

Recording: (4893/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4894/ 10721) 
references when i speak when i am hanging out with friends someone mentions a subject and i am like hey simpsons made fun of that at some point that is the effect that it sees on me i do not think that is too big an effect people are always used to you know like quote shakespeare or something i guess that is ten times more elevated so like oh but that references the shakespeare line or something but i mean it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it 

Recording: (4895/ 10721) 
hot wiring cars at the age of 10 or something i do not know i think i do have sort of very opinions about people who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all 

Recording: (4896/ 10721) 
because he well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talked about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (4897/ 10721) 
yeah i do not know where they are going now but 

Recording: (4898/ 10721) 
i could not imagine being locked in a room for a few days 

Recording: (4899/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4900/ 10721) 
and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and think for myself and so i am exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle it handle that and so when i was in seventh grade and i got in a lot of trouble about the whole racial thing because i am from a school where i was mostly white students were 

Recording: (4901/ 10721) 
yeah and that is the thing about schools too i totally disagree with uniforms unless it is all slacks all of it because you get the girls in the uniforms and they are short and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him i should have said hey you know he have not met me in 

Recording: (4902/ 10721) 
well i think it starts with the family but the problem is in the last 30 years we have emphasized i should not say 30 years postworld war ii postworld war ii is where we broke the family up and let me tell you how i analyze this during world war ii we took the little lady out of the house and said hey we need you on the production lines making war machineries 

Recording: (4903/ 10721) 
mmhmm

Recording: (4908/ 10721) 
and he looks more like that side of the family and he was born we could not believe it we did not know there was redheads on my husband is side of the family of the family and then we found out that he had a great grandfather with red hair and blue eyes 

Recording: (4909/ 10721) 
you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it is individuality again so

Recording: (4968/ 10721)

well like i am getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at 

Recording: (4989/ 10721) 
time to go all right i am done here 

Recording: (4990/ 10721) 
oh really that is cute 

Recording: (4991/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4992/ 10721) 
oh what does it mean well instead of going to your classroom you go into a room where you sit and and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can not talk or anything 

Recording: (4993/ 10721) 
they are wonderful everybody always says to me rachel i just do not know what you are doing will you come and take care of mine for me and it is the fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions and i treat them everybody says your mom is weird she talks to a strange it is because i talk to them like i talked to you at whatever age they are you know i do not yeah i do not talk down to kids 

Recording: (4994/ 10721) 
i was like no i would not hold your gun when i want like one of my friends he had a car alarm and because he had some nice stuff in his car his car alarm went off during school and he said he put his hand up and everything and told her that he needed to go outside because his car alarm was going off and she said no you can do that on your time sit down he got all this stuff stolen out of his car it is like 

Recording: (4995/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4996/ 10721) 
that was rough 

Recording: (4997/ 10721) 
and then they are going to say they want to nail their parents their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what that kid is doing 

Recording: (4998/ 10721) 
before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the library was connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed and now we have gone more out into the public what can the public see and do it is not just for the people the back room and then the web you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody 

Recording: (4999/ 10721) 
they know more knowledge i would not say they are more socially mature or more um i mean there is even sweet little preschool girls that do not say please and thank you you know you have to remind them 

Recording: (5000/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5001/ 10721) 
with a high point in the middle of the roof and it is nice well you could still go they will not have a lot of 

Recording: (5002/ 10721) 
you walk in and you are like oh my gosh do not you know the fire around there uh huh 

Recording: (5003/ 10721) 
anyway 

Recording: (5004/ 10721) 
yes i did 

Recording: (5005/ 10721) 
they had on the news most people keep a house five to seven years before they sell it and move on 

Recording: (5006/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (5007/ 10721) 
i would either go back in languages or actually i am a psychology undergraduate so yeah 

Recording: (5008/ 10721) 
um no which is i am very grateful he did like go past my hair and parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though it is public record like who owns a house luckily we have not had that because we purchased the house my husband and i before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the he has my maiden name on it but no luckily 

Recording: (5009/ 10721) 
so it brings that down and it is like you know they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the tests at both schools i will bet you they are all about the same 

Recording: (5010/ 10721) 
yeah i do not know that is one you stay away from 

Recording: (5011/ 10721) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain it is just coming down all over the place hail and lightning 

Recording: (5012/ 10721) 
i mean you could probably write about a thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your how many years do you have two three 

Recording: (5013/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5014/ 10721) 
40 is like the limit 

Recording: (5015/ 10721) 
i think they need to educate me on what is important to them and i will you know i will honor and respect as much as i can but even people within different i mean a catholic is not a catholic in my opinion i mean there are some old time catholics i mean like my mom i mean that they just are very strict 

Recording: (5016/ 10721) 
well no they do not 

Recording: (5017/ 10721) 
does not happen overnight 

Recording: (5018/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5019/ 10721) 
so really that is about it i have a dog who is outside right now and that is it for my kids 

Recording: (5020/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5021/ 10721) 
i would be a lot more accepted i think here even though it might be kind of i would not do that on my own but if i am i felt like that was what i was doing all the time so i full time 

Recording: (5022/ 10721) 
you know what i mean i mean i hope we are getting to the place we know that 

Recording: (5023/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5024/ 10721) 
there and everything that they will tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else and like an authoritative figure and not believe a damn word they say 

Recording: (5025/ 10721) 
i see that 

Recording: (5026/ 10721) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (5027/ 10721) 
of to be able to do anything else any guy can do 

Recording: (5028/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (5029/ 10721) 
i want i do not want somebody i want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (5030/ 10721) 
can get aggravating and when you get to be older you know some of those issues can be very aggravating 

Recording: (5031/ 10721) 
see i do not want that to happen to me because i just that is i mean i had a guy that i did start dating when my son was a baby it just he got he fell in love with me 

Recording: (5032/ 10721) 
i can not imagine that it would have i mean i am sure brazil would have been an even more different experience but i think it was more just a resentment for sort of everything about america and what they are fed it was a real lovehate relationship 

Recording: (5033/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5034/ 10721) 
i certainly spent most of my time in the areas that i grew up 

Recording: (5035/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5036/ 10721) 
long car trips one of the families is in oregon the coast i forget the name of the town not far it is along i think it is along the coast in oregon near eugene or something like that and the other is in louisiana i think it is 

Recording: (5037/ 10721) 
along the lassie line and leave it to beaver 

Recording: (5038/ 10721) 
yeah basically for the entire summer and then if i like it i will be enrolling 

Recording: (5039/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5040/ 10721) 
he was tough but he was always tough and we did not realize it for years we did not have anything to compare it to he is the only one kid we got the psychologist told us that you know we were talking about things that happened when he was growing up and i said you must have had a terrible time growing up raising him because he was not an easy kid we did not know any different 

Recording: (5041/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5042/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5043/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (5044/ 10721) 
but if that phd was given to you if they lowered the standards for you to get into graduate school would not that be challenging for you they lured it for me my sister did not oh she had a rough time getting about now i can get in here i got a lower stand 

Recording: (5045/ 10721) 
those are unsettling times though you know 

Recording: (5046/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5047/ 10721) 
they probably would have been about seniors in high school or so 

Recording: (5048/ 10721) 
but that is because i am not home a lot and like i said my wife is here now her mom just moved to texas so she is living down in texas and she is got brothers and sisters all over the united states 

Recording: (5049/ 10721) 
not in my lifetime he would have to probably be a closet gay 

Recording: (5050/ 10721) 
things that the catholic church will not like to admit that they are wrong on and they are wrong sit there and ask me to atone for my sins yet they will not atone for the sins of all the priests that are molesting children still to this day and they protect them and that is not right and i am very very outspoken about that so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who would not listen i just decided to let it go 

Recording: (5051/ 10721) 
staggered backbeats and stuff so i can play bass and i have a processor thing and stuff that i fool around with just doing stuff like that some of my friends play on drum machines and stuff like that do stuff like that more like it is not it is not like you are playing right like you are not spending records just like making 

Recording: (5052/ 10721) 
john no 

Recording: (5053/ 10721) 
yeah i have been a fan forever pretty much i did not really have any other teams 

Recording: (5054/ 10721) 
bump 

Recording: (5055/ 10721) 
i think this year it is going to be even worse stocking up water 

Recording: (5056/ 10721) 
there you go 

Recording: (5057/ 10721) 
i think just having like such a low cost really helps 

Recording: (5058/ 10721) 
that was great 

Recording: (5059/ 10721) 
ernest had hiked up her skirt and i would rolled up my pants leg where i would probably not over an ed but i think i was good talking to her that was all we ever got out of it 

Recording: (5060/ 10721) 
under whatever system is popular that day or card games 

Recording: (5061/ 10721) 
why even add that 

Recording: (5062/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (5063/ 10721) 
i can not say that it is an expectation i still say that it has to come from the top down 

Recording: (5064/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5065/ 10721) 
i just think you can not call for across the board raises there are definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they are getting 

Recording: (5066/ 10721) 
mmhmm it is at the same building actually it is said it is used for different things 

Recording: (5067/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5068/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (5069/ 10721) 
i did not even recognize that many of the names 

Recording: (5070/ 10721) 
just for the courses that i need 

Recording: (5071/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5072/ 10721) 
that is adults 

Recording: (5073/ 10721) 
ugh 

Recording: (5074/ 10721) 
god oxygen is in that fluid too it is in that mist that goes over the fields 

Recording: (5075/ 10721) 
he is seven months 

Recording: (5076/ 10721) 
i turned him into a zombie 

Recording: (5077/ 10721) 
that 

Recording: (5078/ 10721) 
so how many years did you actually were there teaching three three years wow it was fun i recommend it 

Recording: (5079/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (5080/ 10721) 
it is just very comical i was just like oh 

Recording: (5081/ 10721) 
the mall issue 

Recording: (5082/ 10721) 
it is just there we go again who is right who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (5083/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (5084/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (5085/ 10721) 
i am trying to work on my license for skydiving now 

Recording: (5086/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5087/ 10721) 
and it is really sort of interesting 

Recording: (5088/ 10721) 
that are the big problem children because mom and dad go how can i get them to do something and stay out of my hair oh i know i will buy them a nintendo i will buy them this sega i will buy them this look they are out of my way you know because you know 

Recording: (5089/ 10721) 
yeah it is awareness again i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of college and then you put them with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like 20 and 22 you can not even control the attraction there but you can be aware of 

Recording: (5090/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5091/ 10721) 
mmmm he would absolutely have to build my trust for a long time 

Recording: (5092/ 10721) 
good 

Recording: (5093/ 10721) 
yeah i work on the auction up there so i sort of avoid the main campus it is been a long time since i have been around here 

Recording: (5094/ 10721) 
himself in the two elections he ran in most real democrats the warren beatties of the world and many you know congressmen and senators dislike clinton because they did not think he was democratic enough i like clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either party party do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a moderate 

Recording: (5095/ 10721) 
it was probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (5096/ 10721) 
right after you are done doing all of the spiel about why you think they should accept christ in their life they say okay that is good for you that is the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean what generation are we anyways i am 20 so there is like the generation x they are the generation right after me and then there is generation y2k 

Recording: (5097/ 10721) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a man earlier on rather than having to wait until they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until they are in high school until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (5098/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5099/ 10721) 
yeah imagine you learned it in a hurry 

Recording: (5100/ 10721) 
some of the classes i am taking are probably kind of dangerous though like the fumes from the paints and stuff so i can not have to wait until those are over 

Recording: (5101/ 10721) 
for two bucks you know you can not beat that 

Recording: (5102/ 10721) 
mmhmm well you had a good reason to be bothered 

Recording: (5103/ 10721) 
and the people that would be decent parent are not because of the situations and whatnot just my family nobody in my family my sister does not have kids i do not have kids we are in our mid to late 30s our friends just had one i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they are just great parents i know those kids are going to be going in but then i have other people that like my other friends that just had one were trying to help 

Recording: (5104/ 10721) 
and the cops on the other side of chris and now chris is just near me trying to be near me he has no idea what the hell is going on i this this sinks in too and i was like you you do not you did they tell you any dude he said i have no idea what is going going on and i could not do anything about it i could not tell him i could not communicate i was totally incapable 

Recording: (5105/ 10721) 
for everybody so you would not go to ivy league you do not even want to look here 

Recording: (5106/ 10721) 
i mean my middle brother was always around he was not very social in high school 

Recording: (5107/ 10721) 
i could see that thing he would be ducking them you know 77 years old i can not imagine being hurt by him you know 

Recording: (5108/ 10721) 
yeah you can not say a noun is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at 

Recording: (5109/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5110/ 10721) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to it would probably be more towards the education line 

Recording: (5111/ 10721) 
sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and i did i was reading a book and i let her out i let her back in and i started reading again and i am looking around and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know you live here it is not the that big of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak 

Recording: (5112/ 10721) 
yeah now if you the thing to do is if you know the call sign 

Recording: (5113/ 10721) 
so there was a wadi they call it it was like a little deep oysh 

Recording: (5114/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (5115/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5116/ 10721) 
do my billing and stuff microsoft money 

Recording: (5117/ 10721) 
but my son he is so i mean i do not know if you have ever met anybody that is totally into politics 

Recording: (5118/ 10721) 
if we stayed here probably 

Recording: (5119/ 10721) 
when i was a kid if a neighbor yelled at me i better make damn sure he did not tell my dad 

Recording: (5120/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (5121/ 10721) 
yeah he is teaching us system five it is just funny 

Recording: (5122/ 10721) 
that is how i would like it to be 

Recording: (5123/ 10721) 
right you know because every businessman goes i want to be there at you know and it does not work that way you know you can not you just can not physically do it 

Recording: (5124/ 10721) 
well yeah sort of 

Recording: (5125/ 10721) 
well you need to go 

Recording: (5126/ 10721) 
i do not know this freedom semiquasifreedom there is an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom and the indian people know the big difference of that 

Recording: (5127/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5128/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5129/ 10721) 
right you can get it walking down the street 

Recording: (5130/ 10721) 
i am sure you played with it too 

Recording: (5131/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5132/ 10721) 
but there did not used to be especially in restaurants and everything and now it is such an open market and they know that they have to accommodate everybody is taste i mean before no i would have to go into a restaurant and a salad baked potato there was nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the food soaked cooked down i mean honestly you know it is like no nutritional value 

Recording: (5133/ 10721) 
he is still in columbus he is like some sort of business i do not understand business whatsoever yeah that is all i know it is lost on me i am sorry i do not have a finance head 

Recording: (5134/ 10721) 
right across from the courthouse yeah yeah 

Recording: (5135/ 10721) 
or the festivals in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are really great and they are crowded but they are peaceful there is not there is a lot to do and great music 

Recording: (5136/ 10721) 
but that is because i do not think americans travel as much as the europeans do i guess because europeans they have more public transportation accessible they get the trains that you are on trains and the buses and just by personal car you can go across the border and then go visit like you know countries like like it is so condensed but here it is like we have got our oceans and it is like we got to like fly so so that 

Recording: (5137/ 10721) 
because conceivably they wanted what was it a $2 raise or something and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small amount percentage get that free tuition 

Recording: (5138/ 10721) 
mm 

Recording: (5139/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (5140/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5141/ 10721) 
but the whole especially with the first few shootings you know with the children i mean 

Recording: (5142/ 10721) 
see what kind of things you are ordering where your hits are on the internet 

Recording: (5143/ 10721) 
yeah you really do yeah 

Recording: (5144/ 10721) 
i do not think that really matters honestly i mean it is i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you are usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like i 

Recording: (5145/ 10721) 
must have 

Recording: (5146/ 10721) 
casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the folly of the ways and dying in the classic tragic hero sort of way and so i am looking forward to how they build up to that point a lot of people in high school what the hell are you talking about bo but yeah i am looking forward to seeing how things go 

Recording: (5147/ 10721) 
right

Recording: (5188/ 10721)

Recording: (5191/ 10721)

Recording: (5192/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5193/ 10721) 
i think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister is wet stinky hair because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason so wet stinky hair wet because i was crying into it and then more time passes so some indeterminate length of time later i look over at the police officer who standing on one side the cops are there basically to make sure i do not freak out and that is finally sunk in i was like the cops are here so you do not freak i am like well i am not really in any danger of freaking out am i

Recording: (5196/ 10721) 
each other you know using the kid as a medium or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did not i do not want to say selfish but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your schedule not spend enough time with the kids you know they are working what not and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and 

Recording: (5197/ 10721) 
have you ever met somebody like that 

Recording: (5198/ 10721) 
well it is well let us put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off of government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could be a crook and i could have people rent me a house low income i could move in there 

Recording: (5199/ 10721) 
and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it is like oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who were not messing around with it have come back in i do not know exactly what to yeah 

Recording: (5200/ 10721) 
cuff is catholics united for the faith she graduated from miami university of ohio and got affiliated with campus crusade for christ and so forth and went out to dekalbion working for northern illinois then went back working for the inner city area of chicago and found herself she liked steubenville better and when i relocated here people say you are crazy young lady you are 25 you are moving to steubenville they are migrating out of here 

Recording: (5201/ 10721) 
and you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now in port columbus you could not do that but you could over there because you can walk around on the ramp over there at osu 

Recording: (5202/ 10721) 
that we should have never been in we were let us see we come around the mountain like there is a mountain here

Recording: (5206/ 10721) 
to make me healthy or whatever because i have always been really healthy 

Recording: (5207/ 10721) 
which every kid in the world plays with 

Recording: (5208/ 10721) 
it was mostly caucasian and very few asian and other ethnicities 

Recording: (5209/ 10721) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when john kennedy died 

Recording: (5210/ 10721) 
oh man 

Recording: (5211/ 10721) 
it was like giving them a license to be a screw up a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts when it came down to doing procedure and doing business business i am a former addict i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (5212/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5213/ 10721) 
i think that basically that is in a nutshell they have reached a point in their life where you know they are cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves a death or smoking you know whatever you know smoking crack or whatever and then you and just living in a hell i mean 

Recording: (5214/ 10721) 
yeah exactly and it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing you 

Recording: (5215/ 10721) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time and i am not as liberal as i used to be age that gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it is a you know it does not matter who i vote for they are going to lose and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was interesting to me our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed 

Recording: (5216/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (5217/ 10721) 
what i am saying when i talk to them or my mother very nice human being and a bunch of people i do not know 

Recording: (5218/ 10721) 
me 

Recording: (5219/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5220/ 10721) 
some of them are all of the above and some of them are not there is quite a few of them that have adjusted well to society when they came home thing i think when what happened is that there was not any joy about like world war ii and korea and everything it is like you came off got off the plane and nobody really cared 

Recording: (5221/ 10721) 
it is just a rule 

Recording: (5222/ 10721) 
right and i am sure it will especially when you already recognize that you know if you already know in advance what kinds of things you are going to be helping along it is lot easier than trying to figure out what is going on here you know 

Recording: (5223/ 10721) 
that would not bother me at all 

Recording: (5224/ 10721)

not so much old star trek i like deep space nine of the new ones back when it was new i liked the next generation deep space nine came out and had a grittier darker story that was not so cookie cutter in fashion there was a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad people the characters 

Recording: (5226/ 10721)

see i would be all up in the room too looking reading i would be just like my mother was even though i hated it but i would do that 

Recording: (5254/ 10721) 
there could still be like a think tank of executives that could be very liberal in their thinking and just you know for social for social not so much social change but not encouraging sweatshops within the corporation stuff like that i do not know how i would get involved in something like that but i would like to it would be interesting 

Recording: (5255/ 10721) 
you know and nobody does the 60 hour work weeks like some people apparently are accustomed to around here 

Recording: (5256/ 10721) 
yeah

who is going to witness this now there is no one here 

Recording: (5258/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5259/ 10721) 
uh that i have to do something like it is more of a this big procession to do anything you have to put on like all these coats were more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like go to the park and sit and it is fine but like here you know you get slush everywhere and you gotta think of something to do you just can not like drive around and waste time because it is because it is miserable 

Recording: (5260/ 10721)

Recording: (5271/ 10721) 
there is no concept behind it you are right you are right to some degree the area commissions are supposed to work on that and help unify i used to be on the university area commission and the campus that is one of the things we work on although some of the other commissions in columbus are almost strictly architectural 

Recording: (5272/ 10721) 
so made me squirm a little bit always in my seat that happened i was kind of like i know who he is talking to my mother is two sisters married southern baptist ministers 

Recording: (5273/ 10721) 
i think through education it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5274/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5275/ 10721) 
so i can sleep in 

Recording: (5276/ 10721) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous but i think that comes with a bigger city when you get more people there is obviously gonna be some more problems and i mean that is really that is really all that i noticed it is obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (5277/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5278/ 10721) 
and you learn what you have to to get through the test of course i did that when i was here at school 

Recording: (5279/ 10721) 
i did not like his last middle name 

Recording: (5280/ 10721) 
and obviously a lot more dangerous i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like college or whatever 

Recording: (5281/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (5282/ 10721) 
there was a little bit well quite a bit of it was yeah some of the people in the group did not play sports but it was not all from one sport or another it was football it was usually the best football players the best wrestlers 

Recording: (5283/ 10721) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (5284/ 10721) 
that did yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he struggled yesterday well let us lower the this hey time out let is get scooby to our men is let is let him out there and shoot he gets to our men is try again 

Recording: (5285/ 10721) 
you know you would have to happen just happen to stance on to it or something you know i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the with the the guns you know availability of being more people having guns that do not know should not have them apparently you know they should be underlined lock and key and as for the parents somebody is responsible for it you know 

Recording: (5286/ 10721) 
but it was not because it caught fire and that time he was burned on the back 

Recording: (5287/ 10721) 
i mean i am all for anything i could do the sales i could do the purchasing i pretty much can do anything i can be taught to do

Recording: (5289/ 10721) 
no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yes the baby is going to be born i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but it is all very obvious now and she is she is great 

Recording: (5290/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5291/ 10721)

Recording: (5292/ 10721) 
yeah they went and won the super bowl and then went back and lost the super bowl 

Recording: (5293/ 10721) 
that was always too subjective for me 

Recording: (5294/ 10721) 
ugh 

Recording: (5295/ 10721) 
i was going to say most of them are 

Recording: (5296/ 10721) 
for the rest of my life and so be it i got a conscience and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there you know that is basically where i have been you know i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro caliber you know i played baseball with with paul oneill and 

Recording: (5297/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5298/ 10721) 
leave the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew is baptism and my grandparents funeral and that is the only time you will find me in there i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow now and actually seeing things for what they are 

Recording: (5299/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5300/ 10721) 
in his own mind regardless it is part of that bad spirit that people have created not the devil not satan to the native people he does not exist and to me he does not exist he is a piece of shit but he is real 

Recording: (5301/ 10721) 
either roleplaying games 

Recording: (5302/ 10721) 
you know like you know typical american tourist 

Recording: (5303/ 10721) 
she did but we were out 

Recording: (5304/ 10721) 
and i do not know i think having the word honors gives some kids enough prestige that they do not totally freak out about not going ivy league you 

Recording: (5305/ 10721) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (5306/ 10721) 
would make any difference or not 

Recording: (5307/ 10721) 
not too far from here 

Recording: (5308/ 10721) 
really i have not noticed that yet 

Recording: (5309/ 10721) 
because it was also a nice like 100 is such a pretty round number 

Recording: (5310/ 10721) 
probably it is you are right i asked him what language did he have to learn to get it 

Recording: (5311/ 10721) 
then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language problems they can not express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorily so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time 

Recording: (5312/ 10721) 
but it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be a parent to all these kids as a group you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents do not even know where they are it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school maybe the mom and 

Recording: (5313/ 10721) 
and they work hard to make it easier on the students they totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (5314/ 10721) 
all of that plus by the time you get to first grade you are supposed to have all the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could say them in order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers 1 through 100 you are supposed to you have 20 sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (5315/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5316/ 10721) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (5317/ 10721) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody somebody get mad at somebody you know they might shoot them or something but not kill 100 innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (5318/ 10721) 
so family familiarity and just the community i think if you had to name like a family crime i think is going up up and up traffic is horrendous but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is expanding so much that we need that 

Recording: (5319/ 10721) 
yeah woo and at the time i was like i am not going to get anything out of this and it was misery what not but i have met people that have been in much worse situations and at least i can kind of relate to them 

Recording: (5320/ 10721)

Recording: (5322/ 10721) 
to melt and soften the metal so they could work with it yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire you have ever touched or been around is sacred it is a sacred fire so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down 

Recording: (5323/ 10721) 
crazy 

Recording: (5324/ 10721) 
that is fine 

Recording: (5325/ 10721)

Recording: (5329/ 10721) 
he just looked up at you like what are you talking about he smiles at me when i talk to him 

Recording: (5330/ 10721) 
yeah so you know i felt like you know know the polaris mall would benefit columbus and all the way around you know as far as you know what was going on with that jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about north lemans 

Recording: (5331/ 10721) 
30 40000 it is international yeah

Recording: (5337/ 10721) 
if he wants to yeah anybody is capable of changing if they want to 

Recording: (5338/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5339/ 10721) 
and i hate hearing myself on tape too 

Recording: (5340/ 10721) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so i am not in touch with it 

Recording: (5341/ 10721) 
yeah it is on olentangy down there north of there 

Recording: (5342/ 10721) 
yeah like when i do the silk screening and this is kind of random but just anything 

Recording: (5343/ 10721) 
is extraordinarily similar so what she says might be diametrical opposed to what i say 

Recording: (5344/ 10721) 
there generally tends to be at least one or two republicans i vote for each election sometimes i voted straight democrat because i just you know i even voted for dorothy teeter the first time she ran for county commissioner because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and i liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i did not vote for her after that but the first time she ran for county commissioner i did it one because she was a woman and i like you know when possible i like to vote for women 

Recording: (5345/ 10721)

Recording: (5347/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i tried and tried i just see it that he is not changing and you know you keep hoping you just keep hoping but it is all upon him and obviously he does not love me enough to really want to change and settle down he still wants to do those things he is doing and i just need to move on 

Recording: (5348/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5349/ 10721) 
somebody is watching and 

Recording: (5350/ 10721) 
well muggings on the subway or stuff you know just in general 

Recording: (5351/ 10721) 
women i can not say i really ever have a relation with or whatever decision maker now and she is kind of the same way so when it comes to what we are gonna do or whatever it takes us hours to decide what we are gonna do and i mean it just gets us nowhere 

Recording: (5352/ 10721) 
is that the way jesus christ would have brought that here well some people have their opinion i said no no i said you wear that collar you do something about that if you do not then i realize what a spineless person you are but you will never find me in your church again so i have done what i have done but there is a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spirituality and they will become selfproclaimed spiritual leaders 

Recording: (5353/ 10721) 
bar mitzvah 

Recording: (5354/ 10721) 
i plan at this point to pursue history to the phd level anything of course can happen

Recording: (5358/ 10721) 
right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months sober i work every day 

Recording: (5359/ 10721) 
yeah there was just something about that sting far better far more than the paddle paddle was kind of a whop and then it was ended up with a sting it kind of got your attention many remember i mean my mother used to say for every law that was written there is another law written over here that will nullify that and actually as i have grown older i have found it is worse in today is world as i said it is the civil rights movement and you have a right to this and you have a right to that i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any more and then they will be well but there are people who get murdered in such a electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is proven and i do not believe that they should have 10 years of what do they call that legal process where they use 

Recording: (5360/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5361/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5362/ 10721) 
i would like to go out there overseas somewhere 

Recording: (5363/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5364/ 10721) 
gays homosexuals and all those 

Recording: (5365/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5366/ 10721) 
i think it is the right position to take but like abortion that is one of the big issues that divide people very quickly i think it is moderating somewhat as the gay activists continue their campaigns but that is one where a candidate has to tread very carefully i was proud that coleman said it and did not back down on that they told me a little bit about his character 

Recording: (5367/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5368/ 10721) 
usually whatever ones i can find you got columbus alive and just not quite that 

Recording: (5369/ 10721) 
i was living with my mom and half and half like joint custody or whatever i was living with my mom and half with my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him and then my mom ended up move getting remarried like my dad had remarried by that time too and i am remarried and this and they lived moved out to sunbury and like this house on five acres or whatever and and so then when i came back i just lived with her up there 

Recording: (5370/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5371/ 10721) 
usually clintonville my mom she is not a big fan of driving she does not really drive very much which is good i have ridden in a car with her one time she just would prefer not to and that is okay with us because she is got a driver is license for id and those types of things but for the most part so she kind of stays like clintonville area yeah 

Recording: (5372/ 10721) 
that is okay too 

Recording: (5373/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5374/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5375/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (5376/ 10721) 
have a good one 

Recording: (5377/ 10721) 
in fact i do not remember but i suppose that they had a drill draft when he was about 21 

Recording: (5378/ 10721) 
who 

Recording: (5379/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (5380/ 10721) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (5381/ 10721) 
well i know but you know it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded 

Recording: (5382/ 10721) 
do you want this donor to be this this and that some people will say that i feel sorry for those people and i pray for those people because prayer is the most powerful thing you can have that is going to get you through nothing else i do not care what challenge you have in front of you you put in his hands and and you have enough faith to practice it it will come through it may not come through the way you think you want it to but somewhere along the line you are going to say 

Recording: (5383/ 10721) 
like they have this they have like two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens and like could you imagine like 

Recording: (5384/ 10721) 
16 

Recording: (5385/ 10721) 
since she went back to them 

Recording: (5386/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (5387/ 10721) 
people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or anything else happens to them 

Recording: (5388/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (5389/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5390/ 10721) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully and they will know their true identity eventually 

Recording: (5391/ 10721) 
xd 

Recording: (5392/ 10721) 
so therefore they are not public they can put whatever they want 

Recording: (5393/ 10721) 
love it 

Recording: (5394/ 10721) 
so i just came down here then 

Recording: (5395/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5396/ 10721) 
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if i slept at night instead of staying up 

Recording: (5397/ 10721) 
i am really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me that is like i do not want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff i just want to get going and do the rest to this stuff so 

Recording: (5398/ 10721) 
i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers and i said yes you can make money with computers and they said what could i make money with computers 

Recording: (5399/ 10721) 
they were not even allowed to believe in god 

Recording: (5400/ 10721) 
heh 

Recording: (5401/ 10721) 
three years i have them usually i have them 6th 7th and 8th for those language arts subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get phased out like right now i am phasing an 8th grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still a terrible speller but he he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspells something 

Recording: (5402/ 10721) 
yeah much too fast for me 

Recording: (5403/ 10721) 
yeah that is what it is it is a marketing thing 

Recording: (5404/ 10721) 
oh it was easy 

Recording: (5405/ 10721) 
there i mean they had switchblades things like that i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (5406/ 10721) 
so he was strictly a union man so he kept hishe believed in the unions you know so the railroad was union you know 

Recording: (5407/ 10721) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (5408/ 10721) 
oh man 

Recording: (5409/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5410/ 10721) 
but you can also grow with respect you can work with the community and still gain respect from the community and you will have allegiance days little cost they do not want service okay boom disposable that is a problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to commute 

Recording: (5411/ 10721) 
that is a real major question is not it no i do not think it is too bad well we could go into the issue of the columbus board of education what is his name he is always 

Recording: (5412/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5413/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5414/ 10721) 
most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or whatnot are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore anymore so they do not have to catch them they do not have to process them etc so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really 

Recording: (5415/ 10721) 
no offense 

Recording: (5416/ 10721) 
i think when you have two or more pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (5417/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (5418/ 10721) 
like it is like we are taking catalog words over the phone it is not really a big deal like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us which is where college shirts and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they too they yell at like knife like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we could not hug and they were like no that is like you can not hug in here or something like that they are like it takes away from the professional attitude it is like i do not even know what to say to people like that this is like such a different 

Recording: (5419/ 10721) 
but it is necessary for the way i follow especially for men women have a purification month 

Recording: (5420/ 10721) 
i am a senior 

Recording: (5421/ 10721) 
and everyone would be all right with that 

Recording: (5422/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5423/ 10721) 
mm 

Recording: (5424/ 10721) 
it is nice they have a real nice arts festival every spring if you ever get a chance go down and march 

Recording: (5425/ 10721) 
they are kind of like more isolated here in parochial 

Recording: (5426/ 10721) 
so we have even been known to slightly start pulling out let the garage door go down i would sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she is on the couch and she is like i am coming i am caught it is hilarious 

Recording: (5427/ 10721) 
yeah i hope we are going to get there 

Recording: (5428/ 10721)

Recording: (5433/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (5434/ 10721) 
is this weird 

Recording: (5435/ 10721) 
and of course a lot of that hinges on the fact that my son is a student and they are very proeducation so my son he is back home now but i wish he would go too he just joined this fraternity 

Recording: (5436/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5437/ 10721)

Recording: (5441/ 10721) 
yeah i contributed to too many people there is too many people there is not enough commitment it is too easy to get divorced the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of just people everywhere and young people today i do not know what the statistics are going to be but i do not think they have a good idea of what marriage even is and also before marriage was a commitment to 

Recording: (5442/ 10721) 
it counts if you are touching the ground or if something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (5443/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5444/ 10721) 
they would not no i went to two different doctors and they said you possibly will change your mind and you know i was single maybe if i would have been married they might have considered it but they said no way would they do it and we are talking 15 years ago 

Recording: (5445/ 10721)

Recording: (5447/ 10721) 
it is like sometimes i think about people you know they call and especially when i talk to sometimes people call in and i talk you know i get the same people or whatever once well especially if like there is people have real specific weird names or something that i can remember they will call back and i will think about him it is like how i have this you know it is like we have this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it is like to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like in the 

Recording: (5448/ 10721) 
if 

Recording: (5449/ 10721) 
they are five hours from colorado so they still badlands are not too far away and i guess it is like 900 miles from here so they can still drive they come at least once twice a year back to ohio 

Recording: (5450/ 10721) 
there is not a big established gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available you could walk in and show anywhere i met a lot of people doing that i mean i am mainly friends with the same people i met then artists my age i do not belong to any formal groups in columbus but it is a real strong network of people you 

Recording: (5451/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (5452/ 10721) 
yeah the police said that they have been there many times 

Recording: (5453/ 10721) 
did you 

Recording: (5454/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5455/ 10721) 
yeah i mean a lot of people really that i knew anyway did not know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and then it was the whole talk of high school whatever you 

Recording: (5456/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5457/ 10721) 
yeah that is 

Recording: (5458/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (5459/ 10721)

Recording: (5462/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5463/ 10721) 
i just go suzy would you use this paper today because we are going to review for the test and then at the end of the period when the kids are leaving give johnny a copy of it back copy would you do that for me well the girls usually write neater and they usually get a girl that does not have a learning disability they usually get everything down off the board whereas the boys will get a little distracted or they will maybe not sit 

Recording: (5464/ 10721) 
i mean there is always been the nerds and i do not know when i was growing up in the 70s there really was not punk or anything like that and i think unfortunately i mean there is always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but they have just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i watch all these shows dateline in 2020 and all this informative shows 

Recording: (5465/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (5466/ 10721) 
yeah that is 

Recording: (5467/ 10721) 
i do not know i had not thought about that no i do not get the impression and the values as anything to do with what they are doing in this school 

Recording: (5468/ 10721) 
i am out 

Recording: (5469/ 10721) 
we are not going to make as much money the people are going to say gee i am not going to them i am going to go someplace else again it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in our society we care less about anybody else if i have problems the government is going to help me out that is a mindset that is been entrenched for 40 some years it is a mindset that if you talk to the older generation generations are dying off now that said we would never had in our lifetime it is a rule nation in our country and if you were old enough to remember khrushchev i believe khrushchev is 

Recording: (5470/ 10721) 
mmhmm i did 

Recording: (5471/ 10721) 
the beginning of the end yep i grew up in upper arlington yeah really those five miles make such a a difference though yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (5472/ 10721) 
but then that hurts the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they put up cameras and they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them it was getting and they had like we were on the front page the 

Recording: (5473/ 10721) 
i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help 

Recording: (5474/ 10721) 
yeah but i mean we are not in a depression and the employment rate is fine and health care we have got some improvements there i mean i would not say he is done a horrible job but i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we wasted where we could have spent that money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5475/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5477/ 10721) 
she laughed about it and i let her skip it because i decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5478/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (5479/ 10721) 
he was in so much trouble and that was the main reason why i did not stay with him he was just draining on me and pulling me down he was never really there he was in and out of jail all the time and i would go through the whole bureau of child support that whole thing and that was a total mess he would have wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff well it turned out he could just move 

Recording: (5480/ 10721) 
yeah yeah that is the worst part there a lot they could really double they took our neighbor is in the sixth grade and they took a whole whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade 

Recording: (5481/ 10721) 
a couple three times too but on the phone and everything and then i sat there and said well you can call me every name in the book do whatever the heck you want to but i am still your father 

Recording: (5482/ 10721) 
he was adjusting on us and we could not do it we did not catch on to where it was right away but by the time we started looking for our holes which were not deep enough we realized that he was in a clump of cactus 

Recording: (5483/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5484/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5485/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5486/ 10721) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting them they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (5487/ 10721) 
88 so we just had our 11th wedding anniversary yeah 

Recording: (5488/ 10721) 
without being with them 

Recording: (5489/ 10721)

Recording: (5535/ 10721)

Recording: (5537/ 10721) 
so she would have been going to northland high school which is up here just up where i am living 161 cleveland area and so it was a good time would have been interesting but then the other side of it women tend to have the more emotional type of feelings and then you know we carry on our shoulders you know so you 

Recording: (5538/ 10721) 
well it probably would have been yeah but they felt that i would change and i have also been a vegetarian for 22 years and when i first decided to do that i really said oh you will change wait till you get married you will you know and i do not eat any animals at all and it was just a conscious decision 

Recording: (5539/ 10721) 
part of it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom that was probably one of the biggest problems i had 

Recording: (5540/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (5541/ 10721) 
i had my head was that far below the surface 

Recording: (5542/ 10721)

yeah right can not take it with you or something

it was about a bunch of teenage ravers 

Recording: (5549/ 10721) 
i think the teachers are every bit as good as the students but i think there seems to be the whole administration up through the board and just it is not as i do not know how to describe it it is like the teachers are sort of it seems like they almost have the feeling they are on their own well i am going to go ahead and get started 

Recording: (5550/ 10721) 
and i heard the thing you know you are not my real father and all that we went through all that 

Recording: (5551/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (5552/ 10721) 
no we used to do 50 cents a game just to win back the quarters and plop them in not too much games gambling on that part 

Recording: (5553/ 10721) 
the public transit system i mean i know they are doing the best they can but i do not see how we are ever going to get out of this without light rail and i am really bummed 

Recording: (5554/ 10721) 
you are right on the top 

Recording: (5555/ 10721) 
in a fight and they just said that we want to be looked at as just other kids you know in high school but yet when they makeup and they spike their hair and they have all these piercings you know it is like they do not want to be like everybody else 

Recording: (5556/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5557/ 10721) 
do not know if that is what percolates it is very different in the public schools than the catholic school in the public school you have all the problems of society in the school you have the drugs you have the absentee parents you have the delinquency on the catholic school you do not have that for one thing it is oriented around the church even though we are not catholic it is still oriented that so there is a lot of values that permeates everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that somebody is gonna get ticked off it is the wrong way 

Recording: (5558/ 10721) 
or to stand on our own or anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independent we said stubborn it is like even go to mcdonald is or something and he did not want onions on anything if he ordered a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and tell him 

Recording: (5559/ 10721) 
yeah i live in seabird hall do you have friends who from burlington who are also going to high school oh yeah i think there are 170 of us here just from my class alone 

Recording: (5560/ 10721) 
took me like 

Recording: (5561/ 10721) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go there 

Recording: (5562/ 10721) 
stuff like that i think they might have found one or two guns that to me was but my high school is 2000 people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (5563/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5564/ 10721) 
i do not know if you really feel like that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they they do not ever really put anything into action they just kind of skate along i do not know if there is anything substantial i can say that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by by it economy is fine it is not that he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing 

Recording: (5565/ 10721)

Recording: (5568/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (5569/ 10721) 
yeah i thought it was going to be like not so structured but it really is and like especially i mean it i know it is like all first year classes are basically the same and it is just kind of like how i do not know i thought it would be different like more of an adult type thing when really it is just they treat you the exact same way like i do not know yeah i think that is true and like i lived in 

Recording: (5570/ 10721) 
the right person they are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (5571/ 10721) 
i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (5572/ 10721) 
there is a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (5573/ 10721) 
to people who do not get along and we look at the problems it was centered on that i am getting off topic i want to go back to voyager what you were saying with the gender roles i liked at first having captain janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint but i still think that the women on the show particularly seven of nine are used as sex objects 

Recording: (5574/ 10721) 
so i do not know just lucky 

Recording: (5575/ 10721)

Recording: (5702/ 10721) 
okay well i am not adopting that role and fortunately the judge of our game is not listening to our conversation so i feel kind of safe a mutual friend much better friend of mine than of hers but she is more attractive than i am so we figured it all balanced out we decided that made him unbiased 

Recording: (5703/ 10721) 
well he taught math but they had a general curriculum it was just like he taught seventh grade they gave him math science supposedly social studies and all the stuff that i mean it was just it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids you heard that he had not bought them books so we had to buy them i mean they got reimbursed yeah

Recording: (5782/ 10721) 
clinton is position on it well he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hoped that it would drop i mean what you hear and read lately is that it really has not changed much but again i think part of that too is society is not ready at some level to accept that that and gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages 

Recording: (5783/ 10721) 
the lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw in her mouth and could not breathe and breathed in all the sand and died first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows us how native american spirituality should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of spirituality religion that is out there native americans are the only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantums 

Recording: (5784/ 10721) 
i mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5785/ 10721)

people would knock on the door and they would yell that they were not home or something 

Recording: (5787/ 10721) 
and i just told them what it has to do with my belief system so you are in violation of the first amendment and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me so i just decided to since they were not going to change i was just going to leave so it is a hard way to choose to walk if you are an idealistic person

Recording: (5951/ 10721) 
i was good in the interview i knew what i was doing i kind of wish i had not been as prepared but it was a lot of the people i moved into a management position it was a lateral move it was not even a pay raise or anything it was a lateral move and the people that i was supervising some of them have been doing it for 20 years and they made it very clear to me that they knew the program and i did not

we feel we are better off leaving them there 

Recording: (5962/ 10721) 
yeah not me it is too expensive 

Recording: (5963/ 10721) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yet the special kid who has no area that he does not excel in like once i had a sixth grade girl who still did not know her timetables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away

Recording: (5966/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5967/ 10721) 
definitely and it really makes you aware of your own mortality i mean things you see every day i mean you never know it could happen to anybody anytime just like that accident yesterday with um right 

Recording: (5968/ 10721) 
oh it was nice actually i ate a lot more healthy and it was cheaper i was getting money on my buckid so i actually got paid heat every day

we have fun 

Recording: (5972/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5973/ 10721) 
yeah exactly so you know once you get to a certain degree of frustration and you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (5974/ 10721) 
you know so i think maybe not universal health care but for children i think it would be helpful 

Recording: (5975/ 10721) 
because we want to be because it is a privilege not because oh my god i go to another play you know my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theatre and i i could be in the audience every time to have no interest in seeing play baseball or swims for ohio wesleyan you know or apply they they would not they do not even want to be 

Recording: (5976/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5977/ 10721) 
so what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (5978/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (5979/ 10721) 
so i do not know whether they did any damage or not 

Recording: (5980/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (5981/ 10721) 
know 

Recording: (5982/ 10721) 
well quarterback is got an injury to his hand i mean he still does good he just needs to focus in on who he is throwing at instead of throwing at 50 miles down the road he is done that a couple times yesterday and watching out who he is throwing to might help too 

Recording: (5983/ 10721) 
you know so it is you know if you have a problem if you want to talk to somebody well if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (5984/ 10721) 
but most of the time it is not bad so there is that it is an opportunity for the musicians in the college to play in an orchestra and what else do they get out of it i do not know prestige i suppose yeah 

Recording: (5985/ 10721) 
and as a result like their kids my age and stuff like that that i have talked to i mean they have no idea what is going on 

Recording: (5986/ 10721) 
yeah those are nice 

Recording: (5987/ 10721)

and as with a lot of the resentment that is felt that i experienced toward americans so rather saddeningly i think our culture is starting to really infuse itself into europe i mean i see instead of us becoming more like them you know them becoming more like us walmart has bought you know a big retailer there so 

Recording: (5991/ 10721) 
and nobody is worth that you know so that is what i am saying it is so retarded i do not mean to use that word in a bad way but it is ridiculous put it in that way but that is a better word that people have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can not afford the legal help so i think that is wrong in this country the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right 

Recording: (5992/ 10721) 
sometimes people just go on and on about things like i got a or like they have like some like insane problem like i do not know why they are sharing it with me like you know like i had to get this you know i had to get this chair cuz my brotherinlaw he sat on it and broke it man i got in a fight with him about that he had his wife involved a lot going on about it it is like like uh his wife is a bitch or something i do not know i do not know what they expect me to say

and a lot of times unions they actually seem detrimental to production and to the actual individual needs of the members of the union because if a union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees a lazy union as a representative of these workers so they are more apt to go outside

if they are over 40 because their company is giving money back to the community for this and that that is how they are trying to show that they care about this mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the downtrodden or you know but you are right i think it is terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do better science skills than we do better language skills than we do 

Recording: (6035/ 10721) 
mmm

Recording: (6040/ 10721) 
yeah well like i played music and stuff with a lot of my friends i do not know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around watching tv and like i do not know just running around everywhere whatever but like in high school it was always just real like you know you put in a tiny little bit of effort and you get a b and that is it that is good enough i guess 

Recording: (6041/ 10721) 
by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge to protect people to protect ideals to protect principles throw it out the window for money and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt it got down to just a dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth and it is the bidding started at $125000 now i feel i am worth more than that 

Recording: (6042/ 10721)

Recording: (6047/ 10721) 
so the way the university here is run i can not agree with most of the stuff they do 

Recording: (6048/ 10721) 
collegewise i do not know anyone of college age that is gay 

Recording: (6049/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i did not have back problems or anything like that but it was just like the feeling it was like i am not right 

Recording: (6050/ 10721) 
under the conditions that had to prevail i was treated well enough 

Recording: (6051/ 10721) 
yeah so um-hum right 

Recording: (6052/ 10721)

hehe 

Recording: (6057/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6058/ 10721) 
yeah and i think i am a firm believer that little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than looking in the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this way and you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to yourself would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (6059/ 10721) 
well we believe that that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again through joseph smith because he had a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god and jesus christ know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but and and he was told that there were no none of the churches on the earth were

Recording: (6063/ 10721) 
not really i mean yeah there is some little flaws but 

Recording: (6064/ 10721) 
i do not know for a while we got it stopped the thing that is confusing to me is that sometimes sometimes we will get something stopped for 25 or 30 years or 10 or 15 and then we go back it is like hey we got moved ourselves out of that going back to it now and i think you know the papers keep saying that our crime rate is going down and 

Recording: (6065/ 10721) 
so he did he went out there and threw some gasoline on it not knowing that one of the other kps had been there ahead hit of him and thrown gasoline on it so there was i do not know how much gasoline on it when he threw a match on it 

Recording: (6066/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (6067/ 10721) 
well not really much of the answering the phones and stuff it was more of my employees that i worked with it was just so pretty much i worked with adults that act like we were in high school and it was groupie you know and i am not like that i try to get along with everybody and it was just i never ended up fitting in with everybody and just things were gossip and i do not go for that and i ended up quitting that job and i felt like 

Recording: (6068/ 10721) 
okay i thought well what you guys like some 

Recording: (6069/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (6070/ 10721) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (6071/ 10721) 
well it is not just in the schools it is in society i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things it is hard to imagine that there is an easy fix or if there is a fix it is kind of frustrating because you can not point to one thing thing and say this is what needs to be fixed again it is pervasive it is like the i do not know if you heard about this in the news a woman two women were having an argument 

Recording: (6072/ 10721) 
not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so inclined to like push their athletes to cut weight 

Recording: (6073/ 10721) 
that movie was good makes you think like right now i am cold when you see it you will know what i am talking about like coldness 

Recording: (6074/ 10721) 
it is a couple miles 

Recording: (6075/ 10721) 
oh no and it turns out it was the faceless aliens set a trap for the guys and i did not like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it was not resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha 

Recording: (6076/ 10721) 
i think their coach is the best joe paterno is the best 

Recording: (6077/ 10721) 
said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was a word i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a vestibule is 

Recording: (6078/ 10721) 
yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff i am like i do not want to do that 

Recording: (6079/ 10721) 
right and just going over it and over it and over it 

Recording: (6080/ 10721) 
not necessarily but you know i would like him to be the candidate 

Recording: (6081/ 10721) 
it is like each neighborhood is got a little different personality 

Recording: (6082/ 10721) 
that is what you better have 

Recording: (6083/ 10721) 
we want to clean or anything they would probably say you know they might think it was kind of weird but they would let you you know but they would be like you want to do this and we do not have any money to pay you oh but we do not you know we do not want money that is the whole point 

Recording: (6084/ 10721) 
my wife was a very conscientious hardworking woman she established a secretary business there at our home for several years and anything that went out of there was right i mean and she did quite a lot of typing for students over here graduate students 

Recording: (6085/ 10721) 
oh that was the monica lewinsky 

Recording: (6086/ 10721) 
yeah yeah she is been known to do that too 

Recording: (6087/ 10721) 
no that is 

Recording: (6088/ 10721) 
i think they are doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easy route 

Recording: (6089/ 10721) 
it is an example in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geometry and algebra you would think and i these straight a is in algebra when i got to jump i thought why am i taking this so that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are teaching it entirely different now and i think linda explained how they were doing it with matthew and said she could not even help him so you know it is in the same way with politics 

Recording: (6090/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6091/ 10721) 
ancestors from or whatever and then you would tell them and then you know on the same turn they would just sort of like sneak in and be like oh you are not whatever of this european thing you are you know i was sort of 

Recording: (6092/ 10721) 
and where my mom was a young high school student just graduating from high school they got together there moved to california 

Recording: (6093/ 10721) 
he is got this thing like 30 sales tax and no other tax at all 

Recording: (6094/ 10721) 
oh you get your choice canada well that is 

Recording: (6095/ 10721) 
yeah that could really bite you in the back though winning all that money i would be quite content with $1 million but $10 $10 million is kind of like an overkill i mean do you think anybody in this town has $10 million well maybe a couple people yeah 

Recording: (6096/ 10721) 
yeah when i first went to oberlin i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i had maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my teaching possibilities although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and 

Recording: (6097/ 10721) 
so we are kind of doing that and then i figure i am probably going to wait tables at night and finish going to school during the day 

Recording: (6098/ 10721) 
because that is like me i watch the three stooges and you do not see me putting no crowbar up nobody is nose 

Recording: (6099/ 10721) 
now i am have very little contact with them and so that the last thing i think okay where are we 

Recording: (6100/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (6101/ 10721) 
i think the price has a lot to do with it because that is what i see over there that prevents it you know they are a sort of middle of the line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is you know 75 pounds you know like a $165 or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you see them in limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but really if you buy that 

Recording: (6102/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (6103/ 10721) 
yeah when you have that many animals you know people 

Recording: (6104/ 10721) 
so and he 

Recording: (6105/ 10721) 
yeah where are they needed right 

Recording: (6106/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6107/ 10721) 
she does know that i do not go to church 

Recording: (6108/ 10721) 
almost the minority it was a pretty even it was a low income neighborhood and when i was in seventh grade i remember going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they are so i went to school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black and i got called into the office and they called the social worker and i was punished i was not allowed to ask i was grounded for the year and they never called this kid in then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up what is wrong with these people they kept saying 

Recording: (6109/ 10721) 
it is around morse road 

Recording: (6110/ 10721) 
i and you know what you go down the street and see how many garage sales you have and then you ask people why would you buy them oh we thought we needed them 

Recording: (6111/ 10721) 
yeah yeah ever authority figures at all you know she is she is really strong about that though because she does not look at anybody being big you know maybe more wise or experienced in things but you know certainly she did not trust anybody 

Recording: (6112/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (6113/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6114/ 10721) 
$10000 fine oh man talk about cutting a coupon there man 

Recording: (6115/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6116/ 10721) 
that is alright okay 

Recording: (6117/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (6118/ 10721) 
right with the human rights 

Recording: (6119/ 10721) 
no some of them play at game stores but i have done it once and said it was not that good 

Recording: (6120/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (6121/ 10721) 
i do not have any evidence to support it i just know that i feel that i have a distinct a very clear distinction between what is fact and what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way i mean one way that television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (6122/ 10721) 
yes i grew up on the west side my husband went proximity wise it is probably within a mile of each other we are kind of high school sweethearts and the whole bit his dad still lives in grove city my mom lives still at our old family house there on the west side and we moved also on the west side probably a couple miles from my mom 

Recording: (6123/ 10721) 
um they like me but then they do not like me 

Recording: (6124/ 10721) 
28 years this is my 28th year i have two more years to go and i get to retire and then i will go retrain and probably do something else for another 20 years 

Recording: (6125/ 10721) 
caring parent maybe not even one of the parents they might have a foster family or somebody that wants to pretend like they care there is a lot of people that are foster families that only want the money and there is all that so it is really scary and i think that something has to be done real fast i do not know what i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh 

Recording: (6126/ 10721) 
people and that is very hard to negotiate for anybody when you are talking raises and lots of money like this what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades are not real big participators in the union we just ride along and from what i have seen over the 20 years i have been here is it seems that that a lot of the union what they did was keep the troublemaker employees around longer you know 

Recording: (6127/ 10721) 
i am just kidding 

Recording: (6128/ 10721) 
that is great 

Recording: (6129/ 10721) 
because i mean i have got a lot i have loved this man to death it is like and that might be something that was is holding me back from dating but you know it will eventually go away hopefully but yeah i would warn her i do not care if he looks like the perfect guy yeah i think he looks like he is a very nice guy guy and you know he just does not know how to stick with one woman i do not think yeah 

Recording: (6130/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah yeah i liked it a lot but it was 1970 and there was kent state and there was all that stuff going on and it is just school just did not seem that important and also i think this happens to a lot of people as they approach senior year oh my god i am going to graduate and then i am going to have to be a grownup okay i will not graduate 

Recording: (6131/ 10721) 
okay so i can just talk normal and it will not be too loud because i talk loud 

Recording: (6132/ 10721) 
we had draft notices at the time so i got a draft notice and enlisted yeah 

Recording: (6133/ 10721) 
took me almost two weeks to get that soap taste off my teeth no matter how i scrub needless to say if i begin to get impatient after that and i am ready to say something i am looking around to see there is 

Recording: (6134/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (6135/ 10721) 
everything you do right 

Recording: (6136/ 10721) 
when you go over there and you see people begging for a can of beans 

Recording: (6137/ 10721) 
waterberry 

Recording: (6138/ 10721) 
yeah just in their corporate offices and that would be fun so eventually i will have my own radio station if they interviewed me and knew that they would be like quick get that girl out of here no but that that is like the most exciting thing right now is that i mean that looks real promising but and if i do that then i am going to have to do something voluntary or some voluntary work or choices i looked at that too that is choices for 

Recording: (6139/ 10721) 
his mom even signed for stuff i think

Recording: (6143/ 10721) 
yeah i think it was

okay so people can like fly in do their little wedding thing fly out 

Recording: (6145/ 10721)

Recording: (6148/ 10721) 
yeah and only for like a brief period

a lot of times he will work for her dad 

Recording: (6152/ 10721) 
you know i am just one of the kids hi mom you know and i guess it is true and i have always wondered you know i turned 18 i thought well should not i feel like an adult now you know i was 21 i start to feel like this response with 25 should not be an adult you know and i wonder at what point do you really feel like you are you are on that other side or you are one of the grownup people instead of one of the little people and maybe that is when 

Recording: (6153/ 10721) 
for example one of the issues that they were in the forefront on was justice for the people in central and latin america mmhmm 

Recording: (6154/ 10721)

Recording: (6156/ 10721)

i got lots of stories i could tell about columbus but i think your hour is almost up sorry 

Recording: (6158/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6159/ 10721) 
they just like it a little less or dislike it a little more when it looks like it is going to come to something it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience that is not something i feel teased by particularly 

Recording: (6160/ 10721) 
well if it does not work then i can well that is what my best friend amy said i will get married and hell if it does not work i will just get a divorce that is a great attitude to have amy but i mean 

Recording: (6161/ 10721) 
it sure works for me 

Recording: (6162/ 10721) 
before i found out actually so we can stop the story here it is a fun story 

Recording: (6163/ 10721)

hmm 

Recording: (6171/ 10721) 
the net has changed it 

Recording: (6172/ 10721) 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know what i mean basically all i have ever seen is well like these kids that get in the house they go to their house they find a gun and they want to hold the parents responsible yes and no on that if the parents had the gun the house and they had the ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car what if the kid brought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun 

Recording: (6173/ 10721) 
he told them and they said well yes you are he said what are you going to do send me back over to vietnam but they sent him home but he was he was not a very enthusiastic soldier i do not think at any time and especially especially after he came home 

Recording: (6174/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6175/ 10721) 
but you guys the thing is just you have all these people in your gotta keep their attention for like an hour or two 

Recording: (6176/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6177/ 10721) 
yeah that is what i said today i said i am the 1 that is unemployed right now

Recording: (6181/ 10721) 
let me focus on your question i am not sure that she was answering what i thought you were 

Recording: (6182/ 10721) 
i got a lot of respect for the college kids the majority of them it is other people i do not have respect for 

Recording: (6183/ 10721) 
yeah yeah exactly the last three outs everyone is like yeah let us hope he does it but until then you are like ok this is ridiculous 

Recording: (6184/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6185/ 10721) 
okay i thought they would just be out walking around you know

easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of the children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment unfortunately i think that is the problem parents are a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against 

Recording: (6397/ 10721) 
i live up north around carl and morse road 

Recording: (6398/ 10721)

Recording: (6399/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (6400/ 10721) 
you know because they will be grown up in a blink of an eye so if i i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold it is going to be worth it in in the long run when my kids are grown up and they can be like yeah mom was there they taught me a mom and dad taught us you know all of our life application skills that we need to know now and i think that that will be better in the long run for them and that is the

Recording: (6405/ 10721) 
and actually in order to get in my room you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid in other words the way you qualify in the state of ohio is you have a 30 point discrepancy between your actual iq and your daily performance in other words let us say you have 100 iq but in all of your classes your performance is like a 70 iq person would so if there is a 30 point discrepancy in there and people see that you are bright and but yet you are just not

all you do is you just keep your records of what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just it is really not that hard 

Recording: (6422/ 10721) 
yeah but those tend to be my least favorite concerts although our conductor tries hard to make it interesting for orchestra members by bringing in some music that is interesting challenging or whatever for orchestra we are lucky to have him he is an associate conductor for the columbus symphony 

Recording: (6423/ 10721) 
why can not they fake ours to make it easier for us to understand but usually there is no problem the only problem we usually have is somebody like yourself who has never flown and it is taking lessons and you have about 10 or 15 hours and we tell you to do something and you like well i think i know what they mean just keep flying and it is the worst thing you can do the best thing to do is say okay i heard what you said but i am brand new at this and i have got no idea what you mean can you try it again and they will go okay 

Recording: (6424/ 10721) 
i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university 

Recording: (6425/ 10721) 
yeah we are getting impatient and we are getting it is sort of like the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe 30 years from now there will be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are we are really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say to my friends i say teach these kids well because they are going to be 

Recording: (6426/ 10721)

mature very driven the only problem she has she did not have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself but she chooses to be still at home and be a part of our life and my son both of those kids have four points i mean they really work hard in school because they know it is important and my son he was the only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at 16 and so i am really

Recording: (6441/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6442/ 10721) 
oh yeah it is so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and looking at your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside 270 still 

Recording: (6443/ 10721)

Recording: (6449/ 10721) 
you know the access is just there is almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of you know in conversation conversation talking about oh yeah you know getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like you know what your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you

Recording: (6473/ 10721) 
right and that is it they have not had a challenge you need to have a challenge that is put to you every day every day so you have more meaningfulness in life so that when you put your head down at night is something intangible is going to be a motivation factor something is got to give you the adrenaline to get up tomorrow morning and say hey i am going to do a better job today 

Recording: (6474/ 10721) 
and they need to have psychological help period 

Recording: (6475/ 10721)

right

god is in that you know even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off in the wintertime god is in that steam a lot of people can not understand that but so the laws of thermodynamics say that it is for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can not be heated to an adequate point of withholding heat

Recording: (6593/ 10721) 
so i mean it is something i am comfortable with 

Recording: (6594/ 10721) 
see people now all of a sudden there is a rash of fires you read that in the news and people keep doing it i think society as a whole has gotten a lot more violent which may be kids more violent

no no they take the money whether you are in it or not you have no choice you have a choice as to whether you are a member or not but they still take the money and if you cross the line they will take that money back so anybody that yeah you know you are better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time i did some of that it is tough to you know columbus has a big you know job market everywhere you look there is help on it but it is tough to get a job where you can do that 

Recording: (6597/ 10721)

Recording: (6627/ 10721) 
yeah the one thing they have done is they have put on bigger airplanes because it used to be you know like a say a 737 would go from here to new york city and now it is a 737 so that adds more seats so instead of because when i first got there i could not understand at osu when it was like christmas time or something it would just be you drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you are like oh boy 

Recording: (6628/ 10721)

Recording: (6659/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6660/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (6661/ 10721) 
उहुँ 

Recording: (6662/ 10721) 
and there were several couples who got married

yeah it was just like there was a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like like preppy kids or like hick type kids you know 

Recording: (6666/ 10721)

Recording: (6667/ 10721) 
you

downtown which is where one of my orchestras plays a lot we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them and what we did not maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than the old building old worship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to 

Recording: (6674/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6675/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6676/ 10721) 
and go back and ask them as i would ask my english teacher in school anybody that said well what did this poet what was his he wrote this poem and i gave my interpretation no no no that was not it they would share their thought i know that was he is been dead 

Recording: (6677/ 10721)

Recording: (6678/ 10721) 
i had always maintained that back in the day darth vader was a tragic hero of the star wars thing it was not about the innocent of luke skywalker in rebellion and 

Recording: (6679/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (6680/ 10721) 
well we put all kinds of information out on our own website which there is so much it is very hard to find what you want that is the problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it it is a problem for us and for libraries because there is just a barrage of what they are getting and it is not just from us it is from the literature 

Recording: (6681/ 10721) 
i was in the cub scouts 

Recording: (6682/ 10721) 
right yeah 

Recording: (6683/ 10721)

all i have got available she said well you have to take it i said how do i talk to somebody else she said well you have to talk to me as long as you are in this college i was like where is the form 

Recording: (6686/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6687/ 10721) 
well some of them are i guess depending on where they go but i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid she only has maybe one or to kids come in already knowing that is how far behind they are used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name 

Recording: (6688/ 10721) 
yeah like they all get the option but i understand very few exercise it so you know if they were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are not using and then give them the $2 an hour but then you could say that osu is helping to keep people down an odd balance there it is and like something like that does not seem too skilled to me so i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but yeah 

Recording: (6689/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (6690/ 10721) 
i think it was more just a family preference i preferred family 

Recording: (6691/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (6692/ 10721)

Recording: (6697/ 10721) 
it depends on what area you live in too the area where i live in you get little house because you are close to everything whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of the area you can and get a bigger house there is some really really pretty ones 

Recording: (6698/ 10721) 
you know she says something about you sure you are not a football player or something you know you got that significant signature there going and 

Recording: (6699/ 10721) 
yeah you go to class in one building and you go across the yard to another then you go to lunch and then you come across another in your locker all that stuff it is just like a mini campus 

Recording: (6700/ 10721)

and i am just using that as an example i mean your other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (6739/ 10721) 
well it is got to come from the top you know i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction so i would say you know it is an organizational problem 

Recording: (6740/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6741/ 10721) 
right you do not 

Recording: (6742/ 10721)

it started on my neck and went down but it was automatic and i mean they had to take me to the emergency room i did not know what it was until 

Recording: (6746/ 10721) 
just things like a waste of legislation money 

Recording: (6747/ 10721) 
and it is it is one color text no pictures to always ask you what things look like and you do not can tell him and to it is like the computers are all screwed up like you type in you know like typing computers and i will say we do not have a movie obviously do and like the new look at a different way you will be able to find like it is uh that is really really got a stand 

Recording: (6748/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6749/ 10721) 
they are in you are just walking around like a crazy person all day 

Recording: (6750/ 10721) 
you know decide where you are going why do you just waste all your time running around like that 

Recording: (6751/ 10721) 
first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed but the principal would not let her give it to him he had to do what everybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade and at the last grading period every day she would give him a math paper to work on he said i showed you on how i am not doing it 

Recording: (6752/ 10721) 
you know society again is taking away everything from you 

Recording: (6753/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 10721) 
yeah i mean you generally could i mean they did not broadcast it obviously but 

Recording: (6755/ 10721) 
it is just bazooka 

Recording: (6756/ 10721) 
the conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this 

Recording: (6757/ 10721) 
yeah and like i do not know that state is notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night 

Recording: (6758/ 10721) 
well my 29 year old she is married and she has a child and she is having she is expecting another one and she is a senior here at osu she will be graduating in june she is worked you know really hard and my son he is he is a 

Recording: (6759/ 10721) 
cool 

Recording: (6760/ 10721) 
they do offer sex ed but it is very scientific in nature and then we did have a i think actually in religion class where they paired you up you were a couple and you had to go through budgets and chores and it was more that type of task 

Recording: (6761/ 10721) 
and they are at the nazareth towers which is good because they get better care there 

Recording: (6762/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6763/ 10721) 
i did that until i came to a company that i stayed with for seven years and then they to dallas so yeah 

Recording: (6764/ 10721) 
the yeah 

Recording: (6765/ 10721) 
some of them are pretty good at that some of them are not too some of them like when you have them copy from this box down to this box these little shapes in a certain amount of time if their visual perception is messed up they screw that all up the form goes this way they draw it this way their brain flips it around on them trouble with n is and u is and b is and d is and they are still reversing you know normal kids that 

Recording: (6766/ 10721) 
well in some ways i guess it is necessary but it is just you reminisce about the way it used to look and and um i was just at a place last night i was at this public comment meeting for the little derby national wildlife refuge that they are planning for madison county and there was some talk about that and it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuge 

Recording: (6767/ 10721) 
let is see you usually go out to lunch at some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner 

Recording: (6768/ 10721) 
and it still is and that was the problem with school he just would not do the work i mean you give him a test and he could pass it and do really well but he just would not do the work you 

Recording: (6769/ 10721) 
hating because he has all of these big government things and you are against big government so i do not think people always see that but between gore and bradley i do not see much difference quite frankly bradley is the more liberal gore i think understands the need to compromise but i think gore will be the candidate i do not think bradley will be able to go past all of the work that gore has been doing for eight years as vice president 

Recording: (6770/ 10721) 
i think so he is not being forced to go in any direction that he is not ready for yeah i was going to college and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so so he was very independent but i am not sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put 

Recording: (6771/ 10721) 
yes hopefully 

Recording: (6772/ 10721) 
a couple that are adopted will be able to get counseling for her 

Recording: (6773/ 10721) 
i do not understand that and then when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you you know they give you a pager a cell phone they want to know where you are morning noon and night 7 days a week and that is not their business so the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate i have a 

Recording: (6774/ 10721) 
yeah the brady bill did not really do it for america like they thought i mean yeah you wait five days big deal go out on 20th avenue and pick one up in five minutes you know i have seen all kinds of people carry guns that should not 

Recording: (6775/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6776/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6777/ 10721) 
that is almost worse though that it is not even a surprise 

Recording: (6778/ 10721) 
out this out to you but he happened to be one of my fellow students out at ohio university now how he happened to learn all these things like he i do not know i did not of course he started out i think the very first thing he was a township trustee like paul was and ultimately became the mayor of cincinnati and he was a very effective oh yeah he was very very effective he was well liked 

Recording: (6779/ 10721) 
i mean in some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reeltoreel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are not in our library and then where do i go from there i like being able to look oh library of congress has it i will just drive out 

Recording: (6780/ 10721) 
real positive about it but basically i lived here for my whole life and i grew up on campus 

Recording: (6781/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (6782/ 10721) 
like big but um it is kind of it is interesting here is you know you just go to like i mean sometimes they are at warehouses or or like auditoriums or stuff and it is just like dance music and lights and stuff it is real fun 

Recording: (6783/ 10721) 
we are finished 

Recording: (6784/ 10721) 
you know i think a lot of it depends on i do not know if it is different parts of the country but cultures and everything because you know it just seems in some parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there a lot of them get married so young they just that is just what they want to do you know they do not but they are not thinking of any future wanting to go to college or anything like that i have to cough is it okay i am sorry 

Recording: (6785/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6786/ 10721) 
i really hate that affirmative action and stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it is just executed very poorly poorly i mean i saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get into places i mean the citadel was begging me to come 

Recording: (6787/ 10721) 
you could but you could take it 

Recording: (6788/ 10721) 
i think the freshman class just ride along i think the freshmen would be a little bit tougher it would be tougher to be walking around knowing different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with 50 million halls around me and just stopped once and i said i was like where is lazenby and they that way not too far from where i parked 

Recording: (6789/ 10721) 
are 

Recording: (6790/ 10721) 
and adjusting to being home and not being so yeah really and i mean i have to work at that because i have been so busy for the last 25 years yes makes it hard 

Recording: (6791/ 10721) 
i hate to be in the predicament of having to change anything it would be hard to change for one group and not another 

Recording: (6792/ 10721) 
probably would have been about six years ago i ran in sixth or seventh grade 

Recording: (6793/ 10721) 
yeah my parents live in akron like north of akron kiga falls area but like i said i had an apartment down there but for the summer i am down here i am a transient always moving my stuff 

Recording: (6794/ 10721) 
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he is a bigot too a racist yeah so 

Recording: (6795/ 10721) 
i do not know i kind of see al gore winning just because he is the most like 

Recording: (6796/ 10721) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (6797/ 10721) 
i mean that is a neighborhood mall 

Recording: (6798/ 10721) 
he is lying 

Recording: (6799/ 10721) 
i do not know like i said i mean it is something i basically see it almost as being the same thing as like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tar on it things like that but as far as what it the effects it does to you it is no worse than anything alcohol can do to you so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if they should actually go as far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to do and 

Recording: (6800/ 10721) 
yeah his mom could not take care of him anymore and he was like i think he was about 14 and he just he did not have really anywhere to go and luckily these families had taken his different siblings different families took them i do not know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families that took care of him but it was good for him because he is got that example 

Recording: (6801/ 10721) 
that like the parental influence is not as much as you know before then i think by the time that you are past adolescence 

Recording: (6802/ 10721) 
yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (6803/ 10721) 
yeah yeah it is been glamorized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because they are so so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you are like see it was not real and i do not think they i think 

Recording: (6804/ 10721) 
well teeter is a school board member for columbus 

Recording: (6805/ 10721) 
they have 

Recording: (6806/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (6807/ 10721) 
아쉽다 

Recording: (6808/ 10721) 
but it is just more of a closeknit thing so it is more apparent how segregation works 

Recording: (6809/ 10721) 
right well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three 

Recording: (6810/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (6811/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (6812/ 10721) 
so just trying to take my time do what i want to do yeah 

Recording: (6813/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6814/ 10721) 
about once a week my wife sees her usually more than me 

Recording: (6815/ 10721) 
hediye etsene 

Recording: (6816/ 10721) 
he was from brooklyn 

Recording: (6817/ 10721) 
they settled in springfield ohio and then my mom met my father he was from petoskey they met here at osu when they were going to college and they settled here columbus 

Recording: (6818/ 10721) 
right but the ones that are racing are the ones that are the standards in the fields right but more and more of those are also available on the web but you have to subscribe to them so it is still an institutional subscription hey that is a constant problem for the cereals people everywhere it is incredible what is happened with the costs i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up $1000 a year 

Recording: (6819/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (6820/ 10721) 
of it is i 

Recording: (6821/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (6822/ 10721) 
or on your hard drive because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft or i will say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over have somebody else proofread it because you are not going to see the mistakes because you are too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say and you are not going to notice them spelled thim or they thay yeah or a sentence that is too long 

Recording: (6823/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6824/ 10721) 
to help calm them down 

Recording: (6825/ 10721) 
yeah it is spring break a couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (6826/ 10721) 
yeah i do too 

Recording: (6827/ 10721) 
no no i am interested 

Recording: (6828/ 10721) 
i never learned math we had in fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables he had a big pizza party planned for for 

Recording: (6829/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (6830/ 10721) 
snap 

Recording: (6831/ 10721) 
you are like hell no i am not paying for those damn cats you are like honey it is just a cat you know it is my baby you can come home and visit at any time i am not paying you alright 

Recording: (6832/ 10721) 
yes i mean that probably the circles i move in is what is coloring my whole view of columbus i mean there is a lot i am sure there is a lot i do not know 

Recording: (6833/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6834/ 10721) 
so she mainly stays at home 

Recording: (6835/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (6836/ 10721) 
multiple health problems he ran away for a while there was drug abuse alcohol and he was essentially asked to leave high school 

Recording: (6837/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6838/ 10721) 
i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is like a it is a foot in the door if we can do that then we can say well maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester 

Recording: (6839/ 10721) 
not believe it they know it 

Recording: (6840/ 10721) 
so it is pretty busy there but it is spread out over the 16 hours whereas in port columbus sometimes you have maybe 75 80 airplanes in an hour is time 

Recording: (6841/ 10721) 
you know it do not matter what they are 

Recording: (6842/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6843/ 10721) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (6844/ 10721) 
she works at franklin university she is an assistant vice president there 

Recording: (6845/ 10721) 
yeah right 

Recording: (6846/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6847/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6848/ 10721) 
with both of them but then the football players you know some of them were pretty much asses you know way to put it especially if they were got scholarships and stuff you know they were and they could be real nasty but i just can not say i do not know i think maybe looking at it back it is like oh i have got into arguments with a few of them and seen them later on you know and 

Recording: (6849/ 10721) 
anymore you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way it is like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing 

Recording: (6850/ 10721) 
well he is polite i will give him that much 

Recording: (6851/ 10721) 
came through and said it rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no 

Recording: (6852/ 10721) 
i would not worry so much about it 

Recording: (6853/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6854/ 10721) 
so i bought my house you know where i only had to drive two blocks but then i had to move to westerville and one of my jobs there was i was a hiring supervisor for a department and we had about 150 people in the department it was growing and i wanted to hire minorities 

Recording: (6855/ 10721) 
go out and have fun person 

Recording: (6856/ 10721) 
i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i would say in general people are pretty good people 

Recording: (6857/ 10721) 
well i enjoy this but it will be impersonal because here you are and i can not face you know whether you are really kidding me what you are talking about sitting there in that and that street cafe or not but i really do think we are going to be interconnected in that sense and it becomes so much more impersonal i guess i am very strong about the term personal versus impersonal in communications 

Recording: (6858/ 10721) 
eventually 

Recording: (6859/ 10721) 
well see he moved into an apartment over on 11th avenue 

Recording: (6860/ 10721) 
yeah yeah people say things like well i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer and i am just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game i was grading papers at the kitchen table and if i go out of town on the weekend i have to take my school bag and all my work with me it never ends i put in about 70 hours a week during 

Recording: (6861/ 10721) 
a little but not not nearly like she is now 

Recording: (6862/ 10721) 
i was thinking about putting my life on book but i do not think they make that many pages i have a 20000 page book book yeah 10000 would be an introduction well it all started 

Recording: (6863/ 10721) 
it is always been my feeling and i try to be fair in the way i grade i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short 

Recording: (6864/ 10721) 
i do really believe that if they would have something like that that somebody would be even those shows they are no good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes i just try to walk through some of the stupid things they do i do not whether i have ever pointed out 

Recording: (6865/ 10721) 
the only time i ever did 

Recording: (6866/ 10721) 
oh my god 

Recording: (6867/ 10721) 
for more 

Recording: (6868/ 10721) 
acceptable so 

Recording: (6869/ 10721) 
which i she said that and i said 

Recording: (6870/ 10721) 
i help janet somewhat but not a whole lot i have a project i work on not as much as i probably should but it is the swan cleaners project and what we do we have little houses donation boxes in all the swan cleaners and there is probably about probably a good 40 45 of those throughout the city so i am in charge of that i do some volunteer there that is for the benefit of the homeless families foundation you 

Recording: (6871/ 10721) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem more centralized it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you are 

Recording: (6872/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (6873/ 10721) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (6874/ 10721) 
and we monitor what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested in books 

Recording: (6875/ 10721) 
yeah there is some people there just get lazy then you got the college students i do not know how many of them work but most of them there is just from out of town down 

Recording: (6876/ 10721) 
to art whatever it is wherever it comes from and there is not the old boy network not as much who you know to get into things or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know so it is not as closed off that way 

Recording: (6877/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (6878/ 10721) 
very boring 

Recording: (6879/ 10721) 
i am not sure 

Recording: (6880/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (6881/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (6882/ 10721) 
sounds good 

Recording: (6883/ 10721) 
yeah because it is all continuously mixed it is not real i like it how the rave scene is kind of faceless because it is not more like rock rockstar oriented and stuff it is more like a serious type thing but not so glam and fame oriented and stuff 

Recording: (6884/ 10721) 
well i am not the mayor or anything so i am not gonna make any promises 

Recording: (6885/ 10721) 
to control drug problem wise the we are gonna do it matter what i mean same thing with guns if they want to get their hands on it does not matter what they have to do to it though the combine 

Recording: (6886/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (6887/ 10721) 
like little papoose 

Recording: (6888/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (6889/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6890/ 10721) 
but you know and years ago it is kind of funny we seen each other and everything and at some place down in east sedona yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (6891/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (6892/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6893/ 10721) 
do not really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dolan and she opened her mouth and things came out and she had the best chance out of any any woman that is ever run for president and she was in a major party which has not happened before and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it you know be the first man after having run for the office 

Recording: (6894/ 10721) 
yeah yeah that is interesting 

Recording: (6895/ 10721) 
yeah and 

Recording: (6896/ 10721) 
never in alaska or hawaii but for all 

Recording: (6897/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6898/ 10721) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (6899/ 10721) 
what is embarrassing 

Recording: (6900/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6901/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6902/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6903/ 10721) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well that you know those i mean it seems you know from what i have read if you wanted to make a bomb it is fairly uncomplicated you know so 

Recording: (6904/ 10721) 
oh yes 

Recording: (6905/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (6906/ 10721) 
and work later then which was fine by me or he would call and he would say is it okay if i work a little late tonight would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that you

Recording: (6930/ 10721) 
heh heh heh 

Recording: (6931/ 10721) 
yeah right because i always keep using my oldest daughter she can get up in the morning and brush her teeth and just barely comb her hair put on a shirt and a pair of pants and go somewhere to do that and the oldest one i look at her as you know i like myself and if you do not like me well 

Recording: (6932/ 10721) 
i just hope he stays around i do not know maybe not but i grew up without a father and i really have that against my father because he lived around us he never called us you know and i really got resentment against him 

Recording: (6933/ 10721) 
that would be like you know what the hell they putting on some kind of gay race to make you gay yeah 

Recording: (6934/ 10721) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage that is where they met no uh uh i would come down here two or three times just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things when i moved to the city it was a real big change because i used to live in the country and then i moved into smack dab in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (6935/ 10721) 
in the meantime you know you gotta pay the bills so i am not sure what she wants to do she is had so many different kinds of jobs parttime jobs though you know i am when she was younger like 10 years years ago she wanted to have her own talk show 

Recording: (6936/ 10721) 
he is an educator which is all the more reason to homeschool because he sees it and he is like yeah they 

Recording: (6937/ 10721)

Recording: (6938/ 10721) 
well i have had the house for probably 6 or 7 years and we just need to move it is kind of small it is a smaller house my husband works in gahanna so we were going to look for some houses up that way and maybe some land we have been looking at some land up north too 

Recording: (6939/ 10721) 
no they were from all over the world i had one companion who was from russia but she was on a temporary mission mostly all over america but there was a girl from mongolia there was girls there who i never was companions with them but they were from russia different there was a girl from moscow my mission president was actually from st petersburg and his wife they did not speak english 

Recording: (6940/ 10721) 
i was a little bit on the piss side yeah 

Recording: (6941/ 10721) 
one of the requirements is we have to be in the honors college during undergraduate and fulfill all the requirements there 

Recording: (6942/ 10721) 
like to see what was going through their heads you know but that is something we will never know 

Recording: (6943/ 10721) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by 10th grade and 11th they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are going to have to go to college the only life they are gonna get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know i am gonna play in a rock band you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drummers and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life 

Recording: (6944/ 10721) 
i am about sick yeah did we get her we have had her for two years yeah we did about six months we went to hawaii and got his brother married and then we came back we knew that would be the last long trip we were going to wait until the spring but we could not so we went to a rescue service and got her 

Recording: (6945/ 10721) 
it would have been a lot better i think for myself and everything you know what i mean if we would have been able to have had jornt kesty with her and everything you know when she was growing up because from or by her being out there i mean you know you can just imagine she is you know then being a girl nothing girl anything bad about girls being my daughter you know about things in school and weekends and stuff like that so or if i was closer to her 

Recording: (6946/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6947/ 10721) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital those things happen 

Recording: (6948/ 10721) 
banking okay 

Recording: (6949/ 10721) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (6950/ 10721) 
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting high 

Recording: (6951/ 10721) 
i do not think that is going to ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think this socalled divorce rate program as i talked about a while ago every or 50 of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will change and that is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

Recording: (6952/ 10721) 
i mean there is nothing bad about them or anything that they 

Recording: (6953/ 10721) 
brother jeb 

Recording: (6954/ 10721) 
and then there is the one that is like oh i wish i had two weeks off at christmas well i used to work at harding hospital as a teacher when i first went to worthington when i said i got another job i got a job working at harding hospital as the principal but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day and i was also the administrator because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credits somewhere so the doctors always used to 

Recording: (6955/ 10721) 
help him be able to move into the fraternity i think he can get out of the apartment by subleasing it but he has to get the $75 to give to the landlord to they charge $75 to do that to advertise and screen 

Recording: (6956/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (6957/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6958/ 10721) 
definitely 

Recording: (6959/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah you can not ignore it because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word now everybody knows anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot and so it is better if you can and diffuse that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but ooh i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6960/ 10721) 
that is okay i am being indiana 

Recording: (6961/ 10721) 
but having having done it before you know and uh knowing where i want wrong uh that would happen again i have been off that shit for a while but that was again that was back in the uh actually it was in the 90s early 90s but you know i was been doing it when we were we were a recreation type of thing you know not as a daily you know somebody come knocking 

Recording: (6962/ 10721) 
what it is is most people do not want kids to live in reality 

Recording: (6963/ 10721) 
more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there it might be you know $25 for one so you buy one here oh they are $5 a piece let us buy five 

Recording: (6964/ 10721) 
oh okay is that silicon valley 

Recording: (6965/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6966/ 10721) 
yeah but guns are always gonna be around you ai not gonna get rid of them 

Recording: (6967/ 10721) 
no i worked at the library when i was a student 

Recording: (6968/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (6969/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (6970/ 10721) 
computers that figure it out just zip zip we had to locate our positions on a map 

Recording: (6971/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (6972/ 10721) 
you are right i never went back home 

Recording: (6973/ 10721) 
that is it 

Recording: (6974/ 10721) 
that you had two dads 

Recording: (6975/ 10721) 
i called my mom first and i told her i am on my way up and then called the irs in cincinnati and told them that he owns a business he is got this and this and this and he paid me and this other guy under the table this much and you are technically only allowed to have so many hours a day to be doing free jobs or tax free jobs and i was agreeing with it until he got on my bad side 

Recording: (6976/ 10721) 
you see 

Recording: (6977/ 10721) 
never i used to have an office out there that business all the time but i have never been out there to she actually lives in kirkwood which is a suburb 

Recording: (6978/ 10721) 
yeah and they are all so different but he deals real well with people so he is really and he is even thinking of going into business for himself yeah he almost did that this year and then he thought no i do not want all the headaches so he is like the top guy of the people that he works for 

Recording: (6979/ 10721) 
well right now i think he knows enough i am just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i am pretty i am like wow i can not even build the stuff that he he makes ships and cars and rockets and 

Recording: (6980/ 10721) 
yeah and the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul that is very true you know i could see in in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (6981/ 10721) 
well they always did because the first time i had one i was 36 years old 

Recording: (6982/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6983/ 10721) 
it is yeah because pediatricians are able to dispense it and i just felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible growing up 

Recording: (6984/ 10721) 
oh yeah we just do not really talk about that very often and i am just 

Recording: (6985/ 10721) 
nobody really admits it but oh i grabbed the paper because i want to see what the agreement was and it is pretty much the same thing and they are voting positively for it this time 

Recording: (6986/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6987/ 10721) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not cheat on them 

Recording: (6988/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (6989/ 10721) 
and outside of english french is a horribly popular language for different countries to have as a second language so i think it would be extraordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french 

Recording: (6990/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (6991/ 10721) 
always had the gun well obviously that is not true you know my personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms if you are a billy gawaitian and everything i am not really sure the background checks really do that great of a job 

Recording: (6992/ 10721) 
so i guess i mean that was really really hard for me i would call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what to say child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go through that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (6993/ 10721) 
and they fly checks like if you write a check today and you deposit it in the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearing house and that is all they do all night long 

Recording: (6994/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah the fiveyearold just after the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know 

Recording: (6995/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (6996/ 10721) 
just like premarital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you did not 

Recording: (6997/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6998/ 10721) 
janet we just had a man who took time to show us 

Recording: (6999/ 10721) 
absolutely 

Recording: (7000/ 10721) 
and just start picking a fight with him 

Recording: (7001/ 10721) 
yeah but i said fine i do not even think about it so it is kind of like 

Recording: (7002/ 10721) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but that is interesting when the first when the when time began according to my what i believe in and everything it was man and woman got married and the reason they got married is because of procreation you know to keep the population going i think that is the way it was set up originally 

Recording: (7003/ 10721) 
do not you think 

Recording: (7004/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7005/ 10721) 
i am going to give up this life here and go to the third world and live or let us do let us reverse busing hey okay upper arlington you live on the northwest side why do not you go down the live on the east side 

Recording: (7006/ 10721)

Recording: (7007/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7008/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7009/ 10721) 
hehe oh yeah 

Recording: (7010/ 10721)

Recording: (7012/ 10721) 
very slow very methodical we take them to dog my husband is taken them many times when they had to have cataract operations you know so he is involved with the girls too 

Recording: (7013/ 10721) 
i do not think my victim that was so close to me would want me to do 

Recording: (7014/ 10721) 
oh i see 

Recording: (7015/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7016/ 10721) 
yeah it is just like having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicting it can screw your life up you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors you 

Recording: (7017/ 10721) 
what she wanted to do and he may have been stupid and a cad but i do not want to know about it on day one when it hit the news i did not want to know about it and on the end when he was not impeached i did not want to know about it and in between i did not want to know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse of where america is on such issues as gun control and 

Recording: (7018/ 10721) 
better head start on development so 

Recording: (7019/ 10721) 
oh they are very good like you call i usually just call and i walk down and by the time i get there the subs are ready 

Recording: (7020/ 10721) 
were people that were opposed to the wildlife refuge mostly people that lived there near their farmers but it seemed like the one thing that almost everybody there agreed on on was they did not want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments somebody was talking there about the difference between development here in the united states and in europe and how development in europe tends to 

Recording: (7021/ 10721) 
right and all the babies in the hospital will be covered under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not going to be very big 

Recording: (7022/ 10721) 
and a lot of them has been getting off the hook lately you see this guy on hard copy he killed this woman is husband because he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions now i think that there is things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide you 

Recording: (7023/ 10721) 
i like to talk about columbus 

Recording: (7024/ 10721) 
columbus 

Recording: (7025/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (7026/ 10721) 
something and that burned his pocket i do not know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or whether he went up on his own but he went up to the store and i think i do not know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she found so when i came home she told me what had happened i said well that just can not be 

Recording: (7027/ 10721) 
yeah there is a girl at the store i was talking to and she saw how i wrote my signature if you look right there she asked if i was a doctor 

Recording: (7028/ 10721) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy political and financial well i am going to reverse that statement there is so much heavy financial influence upon the political influence that it is almost a foregone conclusion and if it does not occur within this year and there may be another vote in another year or next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (7029/ 10721) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (7030/ 10721) 
can have a gun i mean if they want a college education yeah it is not fair but for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and them being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that cut and dried yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit 

Recording: (7031/ 10721) 
so i think she is getting a better education than he did but it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to in high school my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he wrote a lot 

Recording: (7032/ 10721) 
whereas i do not know lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (7033/ 10721) 
big ball of fur do they have like little babies that carry in their pouches like kangaroos 

Recording: (7034/ 10721) 
we do not know who is in the airplane but there are seaplanes that do come in and out of there 

Recording: (7035/ 10721) 
i think i am gonna i really like the riser military because it shows discipline responsibility respect columbus public school and the kids will lash out on substitute teachers i think it is really crazy i think you should have a lot more respect for your elders your adults 

Recording: (7036/ 10721) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to 21 since all these kentucky and maryland all those school shootings and i can not believe man i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (7037/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7038/ 10721) 
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where you are going to put it 

Recording: (7039/ 10721) 
well i know about the gorilla masks and it is a women is organization to promote women artists and to object to the male hierarchy only men are in the museums and only men get the big gallery shows and stuff like that 

Recording: (7040/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7041/ 10721) 
you like the university level 

Recording: (7042/ 10721) 
you look forward to coming home and the pet is waiting on you 

Recording: (7043/ 10721) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying attention a lot you know like i read the columbus dispatch every day and i read us news and world report for my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (7044/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7045/ 10721) 
you know what i mean you can not do this you can not do that 

Recording: (7046/ 10721) 
i always understood each other we understood each other much better than my mother and i did we were able to communicate in very similar fashions we did not always agree and in fact i probably more diametrically opposed to him than anybody else i ever got to play with but at least he understood what was going on from one moment to the next 

Recording: (7047/ 10721) 
hehehehe 

Recording: (7048/ 10721) 
and i do not know whether my second i do not think my second sister ever went to school out there but things were so terrible tough that then mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and got her teacher is certificate so i guess she and dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with us kids through 

Recording: (7049/ 10721) 
so there is from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it 

Recording: (7050/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7051/ 10721) 
there is too much information and too much change librarians this is against probably what the image of librarians are they are very eager to embrace change the internet came out and when it got out of the area it was being used by universities or whatever for research that is what it was at first librarians were right there and they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it pcs 

Recording: (7052/ 10721) 
that is where my father is from 

Recording: (7053/ 10721) 
but the vast majority are engineers i like math and science so i figured well engineering i do not have any other options i must be engineering so i came to college and i got into the honors engineering program called the gateway program engineering is the hardest field to study aside probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really big 

Recording: (7054/ 10721) 
no no it does not 

Recording: (7055/ 10721) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every child and every situation my husband had his daughter when he was 17 so obviously his and he said his dad told him about condoms you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just 

Recording: (7056/ 10721) 
and when they get home they do not want to do anything so they pay to have the yard done they do this dadadada and it is like they have and they always go we have no money and it is like because you pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know it is like you making your soup you know if and when you have children when they get my age they are gonna go i can remember walking around the house and going mama is making bean soup her mom is making vegetable soup her mom baked a cake it is like as opposed to open up oh here is a meyer cake you know 

Recording: (7057/ 10721) 
his reaction on life cole family is very i do not know i guess you would call it dysfunctional or they are he did not live with them after he was 14 or so it was just so bad that his mom could not take care of him and his siblings so he was pretty much on his own but he 

Recording: (7058/ 10721) 
well honestly growing up it wasn t really called sex ed they talked about the female reproductive system nothing about men which is kind of funny it was always the women in that chart 

Recording: (7059/ 10721) 
i heard something the other day that really upset me i was at this convention downtown the convention center and i wanted to ladies that was presenting one of the workshops as a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in 1985 she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say 

Recording: (7060/ 10721) 
no just the player you know i mean they lost four or five different topnotch players that went to the pros and most of them are starting or you know you know so uh old cooper is thing is we do not rebuild we reload you know well sometimes it takes a couple years to reload you know but i have never been a guy have a fan of the cooper either they just says some stupid things 

Recording: (7061/ 10721) 
it makes me angry that people like that even get money 

Recording: (7062/ 10721) 
इह हूँ 

Recording: (7063/ 10721) 
oh definitely 

Recording: (7064/ 10721) 
so i was shut out of the job market then that did not bother me i thought well fine that is when i got the job at channel 4 but it is like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad 

Recording: (7065/ 10721) 
little different 

Recording: (7066/ 10721) 
the risks and what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone the high part of it 

Recording: (7067/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7068/ 10721) 
maybe 

Recording: (7069/ 10721) 
the same every day and not just like a lecture and when we do homework and turn it in like you know it is like we do like a history class we do like role role playing things and like 

Recording: (7070/ 10721) 
i keep thinking i want to go back and take some classes i keep thinking i would go back to school but i can not even narrow down what i would want to take there is so much stuff or so many areas that are interesting to me you 

Recording: (7071/ 10721) 
well the minor league hockey team the columbus chill they do not have it now but because the blue jackets came in but i think it would be good if it goes but i am just not sure that columbus is gonna support something like that that is basically a hostage you know and everything support to you hockey team we got for the honest eight you know and yet they are good 

Recording: (7072/ 10721) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have paid off about five years then we are talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (7073/ 10721) 
and it is kind of weird because when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7074/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7075/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7076/ 10721) 
i do not like w i do not i do not i mean i my i guess my mom was a democrat and my dad was a republican republican 

Recording: (7077/ 10721) 
yeah my wife and i like to do that 

Recording: (7078/ 10721) 
exactly yeah 

Recording: (7079/ 10721) 
as far as i know she was planning on going to st louis university which i wanted to go to the university of missouri 

Recording: (7080/ 10721) 
i am sorry

yeah 

Recording: (7082/ 10721) 
fry 

Recording: (7083/ 10721) 
do it the hard way or the easy way well i think everybody should have to do it the hard way i mean frankly i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it 

Recording: (7084/ 10721) 
yeah i think they do 

Recording: (7085/ 10721) 
not that i have seen you know 

Recording: (7086/ 10721) 
if they hold enough of my views i am not going to vote for a woman just because they are a woman and i am not going to vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have at least and i do not need 100 agreement with my views but i would like to be in the 90 to 95 range i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have moderated from when i was in college to today 

Recording: (7087/ 10721) 
and then when i went out there she had security remove me off the premises that following monday because i was supposed to go out and sign something for a lease did not really happen that way i went and signed it and i came back to school monday thinking yeah well another day another dollar or whatever get there and they go ahead and out the door 

Recording: (7088/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7089/ 10721) 
like i am not really sure how the interview works to become a teacher i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (7090/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7091/ 10721) 
when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that in addition to that and as an undercurrent it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talk to people and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is a very divisive issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divides them you know definitively almost like in vietnam almost 

Recording: (7092/ 10721) 
i knew that kindergarten because it is not required in the state of ohio anyway they really are not required to be in school or enrolled in anything until they are six by september when i found that out i was like oh okay cool you know i can keep him home i mean he is he could probably go into the second grade i mean i mean he is very bright he can read and write and add so it is a challenge for me 

Recording: (7093/ 10721) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and polaris i do not know it is northland is such a a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know a neighborhood that people do not need shopping so i did not see the difference of having both i mean there is lazarus everywhere there is sears everywhere why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to polaire 

Recording: (7094/ 10721) 
the cd in yeah yeah 

Recording: (7095/ 10721) 
plus the mental health aspect of it and everything 

Recording: (7096/ 10721) 
i think the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people 20 years ago that would have loved to have gotten a divorce had that been an option i think a lot of it depends on the way you handle it how you handle it after the divorce is final do you see what does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (7097/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7098/ 10721) 
so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually 

Recording: (7099/ 10721) 
and he does have a responsibility but i think there could be a line drawn to how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been you know 

Recording: (7100/ 10721) 
oh really where are you from 

Recording: (7101/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (7102/ 10721) 
it is just not wasted 

Recording: (7103/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7104/ 10721) 
and the problem is as a youngster as you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably about 35 40 you do not realize my goodness i am dead you made a sacrifice because now i am learning a little more what you did and then by the time you are maybe 60 50 60 now you got to take care take care of your parents if you have the morals to do it otherwise you just ship them off to the farm 

Recording: (7105/ 10721) 
are 42 and 41 soon to be 41 so i think that their childbearing years are over 

Recording: (7106/ 10721) 
he never said a thing again like okay we went for the big bucks we went for the time off everybody makes their choices now you got to live with it them 

Recording: (7107/ 10721) 
kids because they are only little ones that is what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated they are only little ones and they will be grown up before i know it 

Recording: (7108/ 10721) 
models to look at and not just playing round ball or the spiral we need to get them out there and say how are you going to perform in school i am sure michael redd has some mentors out there you see guys wearing number 5 and whatever the number is 8 and whatever ok there is a reason for it what is the other part of it we do not do it because why we do not want to bring it up we do not want to bring some embarrassment possibly 

Recording: (7109/ 10721) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nance i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i am out of here everything is gone and so she would say nancy please just talk to your father just for my sake please talk and i would think i am the child here i should not have to to be the one to make peace in this family if he does not want to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (7110/ 10721) 
i know i wish i knew how to sew i can do buttons that is about it 

Recording: (7111/ 10721) 
you know concertina wire and barbed wire and all those like a big big brick wall and whatever you can actually still see it unless they tore it down okay just like to preserve the history of it okay right so you actually it is neat because you were like a part of that history at least when you were over there 

Recording: (7112/ 10721) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (7113/ 10721) 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder 

Recording: (7114/ 10721) 
quoteunquote religious ways but i do not believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person because there is a lot of hypocrites are good at church these kids i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i remember hearing a lot about too or they were picked on 

Recording: (7115/ 10721) 
he is a picky eater which he yeah he does not like everything 

Recording: (7116/ 10721)

Recording: (7117/ 10721) 
church but the thing is is southern baptist service always has that period where you are 

Recording: (7118/ 10721) 
damn what a problem do not you wish you had those kind of problems huh 

Recording: (7119/ 10721) 
um well as far as my mom issues realm of the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (7120/ 10721)

Recording: (7132/ 10721) 
so it is gonna be tight for our family for a few months you know to get back on 

Recording: (7133/ 10721) 
yeah it was five weeks early delivering so it was really unplanned as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (7134/ 10721) 
and i understand that mentality now because i went back but i will tell you the reason i left was it sounds stupid but he took my teddy bear which i loved and i have had for not since i was a child but at least five years at that time and he just he knew i loved it 

Recording: (7135/ 10721) 
i do not know it is possible but i can not imagine it would not knowing how big it is going to get i guess i can not imagine 

Recording: (7136/ 10721) 
i do not know i do not want to get shot 

Recording: (7137/ 10721) 
yeah exactly you can bring that inhouse i think i mean i do not know i might go out like we should and be completely wrong 

Recording: (7138/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7139/ 10721) 
and they are like wow let us do this too we can make school let out for a little bit they might not be doing it to 

Recording: (7140/ 10721) 
oh well i was going to say when you are talking about traveling you will be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling i know i am like my husband goes to europe and goes you know he goes to california every month and he goes as little as possible but the point is if we wanted to be traveling he could be going a lot more more a lot longer now he just goes for a couple days time just to get back here because i do not like him to have to get well he does not want to be away from us but you are 

Recording: (7141/ 10721) 
so i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk 

Recording: (7142/ 10721) 
wow yeah 

Recording: (7143/ 10721) 
i do not know what their friends did and what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as anything that the school could do but i know the school is a very powerful force in a kid is life i mean it is a kid is life 

Recording: (7144/ 10721) 
heheh 

Recording: (7145/ 10721) 
i would not have been smiling from down there to up here when he dropped me off he did not even know 

Recording: (7146/ 10721)

Recording: (7150/ 10721) 
yeah i could 

Recording: (7151/ 10721) 
and it is just like cocaine and stuff like that your laws are different crack cocaine is one the powder cocaine is another and what they are saying on that i am sure you read the paper the way i look at it i have had four heart attacks in my life every time i have a heart attack they swear up and down i do cocaine 

Recording: (7152/ 10721) 
he had hip fusion is what it was called back then they had no artificial hips he had one leg three inches short of the other and you had no hip joint whatsoever it was just 

Recording: (7153/ 10721) 
or been around but i think doctors should more look on that avenue that possibly it is something else like that how to die well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it is prescriptions and things you know i mean that you have taken but they i do not know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore i really do 

Recording: (7154/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7155/ 10721)

people drive by and look at my little house there in the middle of it all 

Recording: (7165/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7166/ 10721) 
yeah i do not think that though women need to work and most families do need two incomes plus when kids go into high school you have to pardon me you have to worry about them but you have to let them experience some of life on their own 

Recording: (7167/ 10721) 
i am working here but workstudying 

Recording: (7168/ 10721) 
dope

because he is like he will like get out he is like i do not want to be in the bed with these guys and he will get on the floor and he will sleep on the comforters on the floor but he is close and he is happy that way i guess you could say she is into attachment here 

Recording: (7173/ 10721) 
only with her those students who are high achievers who are very bright talented maybe truly gifted who are willing to jump through the hoops 

Recording: (7174/ 10721) 
chantalou helped 

Recording: (7175/ 10721) 
yeah go in there and find out you know is the kid being abused if the kid is being abused you know take them out you know forget the parents rights you know or um if they are using drugs put them somewhere and get them in rehab keep them there just do not throw them there for three days and then throw them out it is a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing is getting accomplished 

Recording: (7176/ 10721) 
i got into painting somewhat recently i have always done a lot of art my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to art art as a child did pretty good too but i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing and just three or four years ago i thought i am going learn how to paint and i learned how to paint 

Recording: (7177/ 10721) 
yeah i have read that i need to try that just for winter even 

Recording: (7178/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7179/ 10721) 
it is regular is enough for me in that and i did not have i could not schedule the honors 

Recording: (7180/ 10721) 
people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is inalienable the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by your yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is inalienable because i did not give it to you i can not take it back you 

Recording: (7181/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (7182/ 10721) 
we want but so i think for a lot of times people do fall and just sort of but i i was not raised mormons so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i i am just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i am also not afraid of 

Recording: (7183/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7184/ 10721) 
yeah i met a lot of different people in there a lot of interesting people 

Recording: (7185/ 10721) 
oh well that is unfortunate 

Recording: (7186/ 10721) 
oh i am not shocked at the bad behavior of the animal i do not consider it is justice 

Recording: (7187/ 10721) 
yeah it is like the woman that used to live in the apartment where we lived before us see she had a husband that she was married to for quite some time he got on ohio is number one dui list with 18 duis man can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you would think your first dui offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend 

Recording: (7188/ 10721) 
whenever it comes on i roll my eyes that episode where they were stuck out in space and the tape can catch me rolling my eyes just 

Recording: (7189/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (7190/ 10721) 
so that he got down in an area under that concrete floor the concrete was about so deep which 

Recording: (7191/ 10721) 
well yeah where would you send it if you could send it to one of the tv programs and have like oprah winfrey or somewhere and get it all over the world you know all over the united states or something so people really hear it then maybe it might do some good if people would begin to speak up you know what why do not they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what do people really think it would help to do instead of having things like oprah winfrey and who is those other couple guys to get on and ask the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (7192/ 10721) 
and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mount vernon area and they got very little money but i was not hurt 

Recording: (7193/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7194/ 10721) 
and then how satisfying is that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people that we can learn from them they put them in the spotlight but we somehow we just do not want to i guess flood them with the we do not want to get the negative answer because it might hurt the image of the university oh gee no who was it katzenmaier or something 

Recording: (7195/ 10721) 
well her major is communications it did not start out that but my daughter wants to write books ok well 

Recording: (7196/ 10721) 
grounding it there so they can go forward 

Recording: (7197/ 10721) 
i was looking out the window and like the other one that says i did not hear what was the question and they are add and they can not quite focus and distract they can not screen out the distractions but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are they are the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle those are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling they are kind of spaced out and daydreaming 

Recording: (7198/ 10721) 
days she could play and she wanted to play more 

Recording: (7199/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (7200/ 10721) 
breastfeeding there was a lot of that i think it is all these poor guys are like oh we not talk about this you know they are all kind of uncomfortable 

Recording: (7201/ 10721) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (7202/ 10721) 
oh sure 

Recording: (7203/ 10721) 
sort of make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do or they wanted to go with it

right right 

Recording: (7212/ 10721) 
mwah 

Recording: (7213/ 10721) 
i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right lot of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a nice solid middle income middle income middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have that like i visited mexico and it seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i am 

Recording: (7214/ 10721) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with chief jackson and the whole mayoral candidates how they are getting into debates that and i know this is something new on top of that i know it was a front page on sunday is paper i looked at it briefly i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (7215/ 10721)

cause any harm but 

Recording: (7227/ 10721) 
i think it is good and i think women are capable of doing that my only disagreement with it is that i would have a real problem being in that box hole and have a woman beside me and if she gets shot you know i do not know how i could deal with that men i do not know if you women have different feelings about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other than they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective 

Recording: (7228/ 10721)

Recording: (7261/ 10721) 
my honors class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging but 

Recording: (7262/ 10721) 
well my oldest one is really odd because the school she goes to it is sort of like thrift store chic and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said you know we are not in the poorhouse you are not buying clothes at the thrift store so she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh you know cause she just looks like a bum i think and you know when it was time for like a um a dance or something she would go out and buy a dress you know 

Recording: (7263/ 10721)

better than that much dirt so whenever we heard any firing like it was coming toward us we would head for that hole 

Recording: (7269/ 10721) 
no i do really believe that if they would have something like that instead of some of the even though those shows are no good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes and i turn them off for some of the stupid things they do 

Recording: (7270/ 10721) 
was a man 

Recording: (7271/ 10721) 
great yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this so i will get that little slice and take the rest so that worked out 

Recording: (7272/ 10721) 
that is number three well personally i voted that the 33 should pass i think they should the way i understood i said yes because i analyzed it to say that there read peeling something it was passed i think one or two years ago it was allowing things to be done up around the polaris area like new roads and this and that and i want that repealed i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things 

Recording: (7273/ 10721) 
and they would have made it so i would not have had to make the decision i mean that was a hard decision to make 

Recording: (7274/ 10721) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and with my husband he is the oldest so for everybody 

Recording: (7275/ 10721) 
i think the reason that our generation is cynical the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see injustices of the past the hypocrisy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff that is why i am cynical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kind of preachy like this is my position 

Recording: (7276/ 10721) 
that is it 

Recording: (7277/ 10721) 
no and she said you know and the last three or four years she just wrote it out so she could retire and she used to be very dedicated very dedicated teacher and she just it was a job then and i hate to see that happen to good teachers

things yeah just keeping my gpa up enough 

Recording: (7287/ 10721) 
you can it is corporate espionage and i am sure that is going on and i have heard cases of it yeah well and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they will find a way around you know nobody is found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (7288/ 10721) 
i think that just because you do so because i know i have done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way i think a lot of these people just say the nurse said you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i think there are a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (7289/ 10721) 
but it is constitution and stuff like that they always bring it back our forefathers did this and our forefathers did that our forefathers also were squatters does that mean i can move into this room 

Recording: (7290/ 10721)

Recording: (7293/ 10721) 
well that is what they have done well they have done that here too they have done it at every university 

Recording: (7294/ 10721)

Recording: (7295/ 10721) 
i can not get into business until i get a bunch of prerequisite courses out of the way because my gpa is on its after this quarter i did really good this quarter after this quarter it is up to a 22 and i am not going to be able to get into the business school until i got a bunch of prerequisites out of the way and there is sequences i can not take counting 212 until i am done with 211 i can not take cis 201 until i am done with 200 and all that junk 

Recording: (7296/ 10721) 
during the depression my grandfather moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (7297/ 10721) 
it is kind of funny you are allowed to drink before you are allowed to drive 

Recording: (7298/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7299/ 10721) 
a day she could teach 

Recording: (7300/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7301/ 10721) 
so it was kind of a nobrainer i was like all my friends and somebody who understands 

Recording: (7302/ 10721) 
ai not no way 

Recording: (7303/ 10721) 
you understand what i mean 

Recording: (7304/ 10721) 
yes i do 

Recording: (7305/ 10721) 
like sitting out on the street all the time honking the horns ringing the bells doing the whistles the really annoying chants i had classes in the bnz building that we just had to cancel because they were too loud 

Recording: (7306/ 10721) 
doing the dumbing down of schools 

Recording: (7307/ 10721) 
thing sometimes i was listening to corby some show on wtv and i was listening to them talk shows and everything and he spoke he supposedly said something to one assistant coach said that you know i would like to hire you and everything but you are not the right person collar and i mean that is not something that you would think a head coach at ohio state would say you know 

Recording: (7308/ 10721) 
but i 

Recording: (7309/ 10721) 
that he remembers he remembers the stepfathers and that kind of thing it is just not a good stuff 

Recording: (7310/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7311/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (7312/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7313/ 10721) 
there is been a lot of problems with him he is a brilliant kid they told us in elementary school he had the highest iq they would ever had tested he is very creative very talented musically he was taking lessons from gene walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university and he is said that he thought charlie had the makings to be a professional make a living career as a jazz saxophonist but there is also in the last four years or so a lot of 

Recording: (7314/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7315/ 10721) 
it was a law enforcement career center and i mean 

Recording: (7316/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (7317/ 10721) 
with their eye or the car accident 

Recording: (7318/ 10721) 
i figure that would be plenty i told my mom i just want green jello she said you did not make me snacks 

Recording: (7319/ 10721) 
it is just wonderful i know like saturday we are going to drive to oberlin to watch swim 2 events and come back so you know she says mom i am only going to be in the water five minutes total why are you guys driving to oberlin in ohio for this because we would not miss it there will be a time when she will not be doing those things so it is just important and it is wonderful and i just think it is just such an opportunity i am so lucky to be able to do that see now like my husband i am 11 years older than he is 

Recording: (7320/ 10721) 
i work at a company plus i help out at the bva vietnam veterans association 

Recording: (7321/ 10721) 
need to calm down i mean 

Recording: (7322/ 10721) 
oh no that is fine thanks 

Recording: (7323/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (7324/ 10721) 
not to sound like a broken record but i really think it is our backslide on on family unit it is i think it is too easy to stay and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me that it is too easy to get divorced people do not really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i do not want to say old 

Recording: (7325/ 10721) 
like this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like 94 95 i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been 100 successful the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (7326/ 10721) 
it is just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (7327/ 10721) 
yeah i have heard that too it is different i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worse then you can talk to some other people people that are all you have not seen anything yet wait till they just do not even want to be in sight with you and do not wait till they you know i am not going on vacation with you i can 

Recording: (7328/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (7329/ 10721) 
i mean it is just like people are learning things and wanting to go on to college and stuff 

Recording: (7330/ 10721) 
the right 

Recording: (7331/ 10721) 
yeah my husband was one of those 

Recording: (7332/ 10721) 
they are fun 

Recording: (7333/ 10721) 
i paint sesame street or something i do not paint sesame street there is something from childhood that i paint and now it is somewhat mainstream so it sounds a little funny i also have painted a couple of portraits i am pretty happy with of some friends i have done a selfportrait that kind of thing 

Recording: (7334/ 10721) 
i do not think it hurt me not knowing it 

Recording: (7335/ 10721) 
the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i always tell teachers if you could just walk for one day in their shoes you probably have a lot of empathy for them 

Recording: (7336/ 10721) 
government does not seem to work too swiftly 

Recording: (7337/ 10721) 
like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or cutting school and stuff yeah 

Recording: (7338/ 10721) 
the leaking you know ceilings all of the peeling floors all of the bad chalkboards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools are so bad they said we are not going to support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said you know 18 months later when the board put another their levy on the ballot we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement 

Recording: (7339/ 10721) 
and she did this and she did this and this and they are going to go oh you know it is like you know what do you want at the very end you know 

Recording: (7340/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (7341/ 10721) 
i was going to say i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is and all that kind of thing and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife 

Recording: (7342/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (7343/ 10721) 
that is the way we figured in a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean there is times when we did not know where he was for a week or two a week at a time i was driving lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street it is a pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (7344/ 10721) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (7345/ 10721) 
i think it is better that if people are get to a point where they can not work it out a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (7346/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7347/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7348/ 10721) 
so she does not want to take the baby home so they are arranging some other things we have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time but we think it is going to be too hard for us 

Recording: (7349/ 10721) 
well and do not you think too that the more they have found out psychologically speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the throes of not having enough or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i both know that experience from being one of 11 children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (7350/ 10721) 
and there is people like that today still but i think people should go to retirement centers and sit down make a visit to them every week make a part of their life and develop a friendship 

Recording: (7351/ 10721) 
wittenberg 

Recording: (7352/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7353/ 10721) 
you know because i just think it looks so awful when you can not even admit to what your opinion is 

Recording: (7354/ 10721) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an osu employee 

Recording: (7355/ 10721) 
years ago there was a citizen i do not know if you were what your background is where you were here but citizen journal was a daily paper and it was the opposite of the dispatch it was much more liberal they used this it was a morning paper and the dispatch was an afternoon paper evening paper and they shared the same facilities the same printing presses and everything and then dispatched when their lease expired would not renew their lease 

Recording: (7356/ 10721) 
a single mom and the father is in another relationship and probably on his way to getting married it does not look like he is going to be in the picture that much and she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him to be too 

Recording: (7357/ 10721) 
yeah you should be well aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (7358/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (7359/ 10721) 
my respect oh yeah but i see everyone is engaging in sinful behavior because in my religion everyone sins i am a christian i go to a nondenominational church i do not like the nominations i am not 

Recording: (7360/ 10721) 
because somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child now the other girl she just has a 4 month old and has been in daycare for 3 weeks and she is going to quit her job and go to a working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (7361/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (7362/ 10721) 
yeah i think so i think so and like neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me you know 

Recording: (7363/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (7364/ 10721) 
we will go to different websites sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to everything 

Recording: (7365/ 10721) 
you are much bigger and you can control the thing and keep it away from her yeah but i do not want somebody else telling me what they can watch and not watch that is my job but i do not know how i mean the media presupposedly i mean this may be a way it works the media the media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it or whatever they do not but it is when it is like the constant barrage that this is what you get the monica lewinsky stuff 

Recording: (7366/ 10721) 
uh lunch she was there for pregnancy but she did and i am just going to public school 

Recording: (7367/ 10721) 
a good philosophy to live by and people of other religions and everything i mean i learned a lot about religion when i was raised baptist basically but i practice more catholic than anything else now but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and everything just because they find it interesting 

Recording: (7368/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (7369/ 10721) 
and i looked at it and i thought introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader than that so i ended up coming up with a class that was only nine weeks it was only nine classes so it was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks and i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly and visual art and for the second three weeks we 

Recording: (7370/ 10721) 
oh that is why okay

cuyahoga falls

yeah we had a my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds 

Recording: (7373/ 10721) 
whole time i was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you can have made sacrifices to be there also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol in that film california with brad pitt and julie lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else 

Recording: (7374/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (7375/ 10721) 
did not have it done through ceremony nothing like that and even the man that he followed for a while is sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now because he is old he is on his way out and he was a road man gave his life for 89 tribes to help them find and refine their connection with their spirituality that they would lost because of the missionaries bringing christianity 

Recording: (7376/ 10721) 
uh huh uh-huh 

Recording: (7377/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7378/ 10721) 
i was not happy there anyway then took a couple months off and did some consulting worked on a consulting project at a board wardens for about six months and then when that project ended just at the same time it ended my fatherinlaw was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they were from chillicothe so i became his caregiver for about three months until he died 

Recording: (7379/ 10721)

Recording: (7381/ 10721) 
mmhmm mmhmm 

Recording: (7382/ 10721) 
ah 

Recording: (7383/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7384/ 10721) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (7385/ 10721) 
oh yeah oh yeah it used to be when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 

Recording: (7386/ 10721) 
that is because it is kind of like warm and tropical that is why they like it down there 

Recording: (7387/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7388/ 10721) 
as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it is yeah i mean when you come down to these things there is people with mental illness and with a disability are trying to pawn off the responsibility onto everybody but themselves if they would have seen this guy and given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody you know shoulda woulda coulda man if the guy stopped taking his 

Recording: (7389/ 10721) 
was it hard 

Recording: (7390/ 10721) 
and therefore i am cool 

Recording: (7391/ 10721) 
and so when my sister and i graduated we each bought each other a doll baby and i got mine to this day because i would not even let my daughter play with her 

Recording: (7392/ 10721) 
his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right if he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that is not necessarily his opinion that is what i am trying to make a point there but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from of various people within his community whether you are talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be 

Recording: (7393/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7394/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7395/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7396/ 10721)

Recording: (7397/ 10721) 
familiar with sarcom yes 

Recording: (7398/ 10721) 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would have preferred that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but no i am i am very happy and content with her decision and ironically julie tulsa she and her husband both baptists they have both their children in a catholic prep school yeah kindergarten and preschool 

Recording: (7399/ 10721) 
you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres has pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs the show and that is when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so 

Recording: (7400/ 10721) 
years ago because it was something well it was right there with a lot of people population and everything and then like i said you know you got basically the people moving out to get away from the traffic and all that stuff you know not that they are moving away from it they are still getting into it but it is just your perspective on then you have to if you build it they will come they say 

Recording: (7401/ 10721) 
even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university you do not hear any universal negative things about the university ever 

Recording: (7402/ 10721) 
yeah i probably will so you will be watching her on the commercial breaks and ignoring the actual call yeah 

Recording: (7403/ 10721) 
or 30 houses that they had to take out here 

Recording: (7404/ 10721)

Recording: (7477/ 10721)

Recording: (7548/ 10721) 
because the priest they had there would not let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion and that is pretty much the priest decides that and he felt singled out and he was he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with it but it has not been a problem person myself but i am not against it and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well they are teaching values 

Recording: (7549/ 10721) 
i am guessing

views on a lot of things it is dry they have real strict visitation policies things like that my thought is if you are if you are considered an adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (7580/ 10721)

Recording: (7583/ 10721) 
you know it is a real word and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh jeez are we doing the right thing thing but some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it and we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know

Recording: (7597/ 10721) 
civil rights only went so far they have not corrected the wrongs in the past they have not created a sense in our society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in my opinion is an absolute lie 

Recording: (7598/ 10721)

Recording: (7619/ 10721) 
as much as she could we were poor but we managed

yeah so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an 80 iq for example and you know he is not going to get all the details and the battles and the years and the names but you just wanted to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted just the main concepts well there is the kid that you say todd you study for the test and when you come in i will let you answer anything on the test you know

Recording: (7639/ 10721) 
in my own home i have been a collector now i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time when he was out of work guess what i i do not know what welfare agency it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first doll baby i ever had and i remember when i tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water well if you do not know how to take care of it any better than that i will never buy you another one and believe me she did not 

Recording: (7640/ 10721) 
i mean i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i always think of how my parents would handle it and i do 180 degrees i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been there way you know and it is you know 

Recording: (7641/ 10721) 
i am concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely i feel it is absolutely essential that we have penalties we have for everyone for everyone really across the board we are getting away from penalty we are getting away from penalty but so many people just to give an example talking about adults i just read a statistic 

Recording: (7642/ 10721) 
they are supposed to do and all that reminds me of a joke i gotta tell this maybe this is off the record but i read it in reader is digest the other day and it said about this little the mother was trying to teach a child how to put the clothes away she said go put it in a hamper and a kid looked at her like it is crazy hamper hamper well you know where where daddy and mommy never put our clothes when we take them off and the kid immediately took his clothes and threw them down by the side of daddy is bed

Recording: (7645/ 10721) 
i remember when i was married my ex said you want to go shopping what 

Recording: (7646/ 10721) 
only the only can do it it seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that but people who have guns in their home and not have them locked locked up or in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are they are to blame that whole thing with the school out in colorado i forget the name of it yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents did not 

Recording: (7647/ 10721) 
look alike forget it but yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (7648/ 10721) 
and yes it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is attention to the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptists 

Recording: (7649/ 10721) 
the shot 

Recording: (7650/ 10721) 
i need something to say and selling my own time does not actually seem to be a worthwhile endeavor i have done it i have already done independent consulting wherein i set up a contract and said hi you are pay me i will do this thing and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that the problem is you get taxed obscenely like that because you do not have an employer paying half your taxes for you 

Recording: (7651/ 10721) 
except for last year no i am just kidding 

Recording: (7652/ 10721) 
you know always something going on 

Recording: (7653/ 10721) 
option 

Recording: (7654/ 10721) 
excuse me well typically what i observed is conflict with mom most of the time well i think a lot of times when there is a stepfather involved you know that becomes a problem for sure some of them but they said you know you might run into a case where you know the family is abusing the 

Recording: (7655/ 10721) 
i am working on three different research projects with three different physicians two are specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at longterm outcomes in people that have sustained traumatic brain injuries the other one is a drug study looking at control of agitation and the other one is a spinal cord injury research study 

Recording: (7656/ 10721) 
it will be a long campaign i thought it was interesting that gore suggested two debates a week and i just can not imagine what you two debates a week for months at least they could get things out into the open they have the chance but who wants to watch that much who has the time to watch that much 

Recording: (7657/ 10721) 
people are more scared of you than you are of them 

Recording: (7658/ 10721) 
if we can teach people to think the way you are trying to tell me well businesses tell us we should do it then why does not business tell us we should do it business take a more social correctiveness not political correctness of giving of themselves they are fortunate to be in a country like the united states one statistic i found very interesting i read the paper a few days ago that despite the fact that our our economy is just roaring and people are making a lot of money in the stock market and things like that that charity donations have not increased proportionally and i found that to be interesting and dismaying 

Recording: (7659/ 10721) 
since march too 

Recording: (7660/ 10721) 
he was recovered he was about 34 years old 

Recording: (7661/ 10721)

Recording: (7662/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (7663/ 10721) 
they need a lot of women in that field they need good people there the money does not hurt 

Recording: (7664/ 10721) 
and because of that the athletic director that was here at the time he quit because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him 

Recording: (7665/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7666/ 10721) 
only like 50 cents away from that cap and if that is the case if i retire in six years i will be capped out right now so in other words i am going to retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but that was not even on the negotiating table still worried about this $2 and get this hospital yeah that is what they were fighting for was the low end and try to get the hospital in the main 

Recording: (7667/ 10721) 
egg 

Recording: (7668/ 10721) 
that comes back to the lack of our morals and our society promotes it they are doing the tax laws and all the government you say government do this government is doing it to themselves 

Recording: (7669/ 10721) 
i like playing that band mostly because the director is he is has a his dad teaches trumpet here at ohio state and he likes to challenge us not so much in the summer we end up playing marches and stuff that popular favorites

Recording: (7680/ 10721) 
like stay the heck out of my way here i come it is my world and welcome to it 

Recording: (7681/ 10721) 
more familyoriented your friends are basically you know you count them on your hand which you still can but but you socialize a lot more if you are in the city with more people and everything more if you come from like a smaller town you tend to socialize with certain people you know a group or whatever 

Recording: (7682/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (7683/ 10721) 
eh 

Recording: (7684/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7685/ 10721) 
than if they wait later on in their life but sometimes i guess they change most of the men i knew right off the bat i mean it was all through their life it was not as though they just said oh i am going to be gay 

Recording: (7686/ 10721) 
to do that 

Recording: (7687/ 10721) 
really you know it is half a million dollars still out of our range

Recording: (7689/ 10721) 
well i wanted to go to missouri or come here but she says the only reason you want me to come here is because you get a football ticket or something 

Recording: (7690/ 10721) 
when they get home that is fine but yeah it is another thing where you are trying to focus on your work and you are not allowed to date never alone but you can live where you served you can do whatever you want after you are done 

Recording: (7691/ 10721) 
a spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys my daughter and son that they have come to me for answers i think i do not know that is probably the other problem is sometimes maybe the siblings or the children do not have a parent to go to but again let me reiterate we do not have a smooth marriage 

Recording: (7692/ 10721) 
yeah i want to i just do not do it 

Recording: (7693/ 10721) 
you are intelligent 

Recording: (7694/ 10721) 
americans are if you look at opinion polls so you have to find a way to moderate that stance whether you are republican or democrat 

Recording: (7695/ 10721) 
i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals in the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there whatever and the kids they are 

Recording: (7696/ 10721) 
well the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just too much partying around left 12th avenue because i could not you know but you know just everybody on the neighbors being loud and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with it any of that 

Recording: (7697/ 10721) 
that that is what is making these kids think they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (7698/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (7699/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i do not see any particular reason for her to wear the spandex except for to appeal to a 18 through 25 male audience which i think it does i am sorry 

Recording: (7700/ 10721) 
they have been married with for five years and i think they have lived six different places they are just constantly on the move they just do not have the connection with the family family and i do not know if that is a bad thing it is just they are not 

Recording: (7701/ 10721) 
thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so traumatizing to them like that would be like for four years every day you are just like teased or something like horrible and like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (7702/ 10721) 
grade we were already writing cursive already that is all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe you might be learning something yeah she is in fractions she is doing fractions she is doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one two plus you know in second grade it is just seems like they are three years ahead 

Recording: (7703/ 10721) 
especially the guys yeah 

Recording: (7704/ 10721) 
yeah well and that was really a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in security jobs like that i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either going to downsize or they are going to do something and they always did did so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job i never had to i never missed you know i would say 

Recording: (7705/ 10721) 
a simple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregon is not that great but you know they say in gene that even the dishwashers have phds well the level of the year of education per capita is probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (7706/ 10721) 
are not there other important roles where would those nuns be where would your mother possibly have been if she went to catholic school i take it where would she have been if it were not for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked a lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for and they had a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (7707/ 10721) 
i mean it is just too dry 

Recording: (7708/ 10721) 
bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (7709/ 10721) 
and the other one is mcdonald is 

Recording: (7710/ 10721) 
yeah thanks mmhmm 

Recording: (7711/ 10721) 
the way america is going or whatever the youth and like i said i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other other than like i mean obviously guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (7712/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7713/ 10721) 
we should be getting pretty near 

Recording: (7714/ 10721) 
in the federal government to collect occupational data we were kind of a conduit for the state for that they wanted an hourly rate they did not want a range they wanted a number and that was gospel but it is based on survey data and there is always statistical error in there and stuff and try to explain that we spent more time when people call and give information explaining this is what this really means 

Recording: (7715/ 10721) 
were giving on the average number of children that these women were having and the average number of children that were just taken into the hospital and left there or just dropped off wherever and the state that these children were in and their life span and everything else there is the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the child is life i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases 

Recording: (7716/ 10721) 
i got on birth control probably when i was like 16 or 17 but still i did not take the pills all the time and you know that was not very good for me or maybe neither 

Recording: (7717/ 10721) 
but at the same time i do not think i would really hold it against him 

Recording: (7718/ 10721) 
the university never has money that is like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two jobs for 10 years while i was here the first 10 years just to make a living 

Recording: (7719/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (7720/ 10721) 
yeah and i had stalled with it i knew that what had to happen on the outside which is really only some minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the front yard and then we have there is a guy who works for me who is um i just do not know how he can how he makes a living because he is very very reasonable he is also very loyal to me he is done stuff for me for years and he is not that old he is probably 28 or 29 now but anyhow pat went in we added a bathroom there was a mudroom we added a half bath off the floor 

Recording: (7721/ 10721)

Recording: (7726/ 10721) 
you really need to start teaching what i call the older values but good values i do not care whether they are old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of courses that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can 

Recording: (7727/ 10721) 
and i just sit there for a minute before i take it out i take it on out sit on top of it and i said well mommy said a bad word i guess that mommy has to have soup in her mouth does not she did i get a pussy in your mouth mommy

well yeah i think it is real important to really get a good feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and if they do not then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we

Recording: (7833/ 10721)

Recording: (7865/ 10721) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the 12 symptoms or 

Recording: (7866/ 10721)

i remember when i first started going to the unitarian church up here on well when i was in sunday school we drove there from reynoldsburg by going up i think reynoldsburgnew albany road up to morse road and then over on morse road to high street so it was on the back roads you know and that was before the mid60s 

Recording: (7910/ 10721) 
i do i think they should you know if you are open with your kids nowadays you have to be with everything that is in the world i mean my parents never talked to me about drugs or anything 

Recording: (7911/ 10721) 
yeah exactly exactly 

Recording: (7912/ 10721) 
oh no 

Recording: (7913/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah cuz i could not imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (7914/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7915/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (7916/ 10721) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (7917/ 10721) 
dehydration 

Recording: (7918/ 10721) 
sure 

Recording: (7919/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (7920/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7921/ 10721) 
we take them to wyandotte lake or the zoo or all types of things the best thing you have got to get a membership to everything that is what we figured out we have got cosign we got the zoo and we got wyandotte lake and that way you can go whenever you want if an hour into the show they are not participating properly you can can leave and you are not out anything yeah yeah yeah that cosi is great we really like that they have really 

Recording: (7922/ 10721) 
the reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it is an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers and i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions 

Recording: (7923/ 10721) 
talk to him like you know this be nice down 

Recording: (7924/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (7925/ 10721) 
yeah they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduced deductions it went down too yeah yeah and then again you say well you know like maybe some affluent person would donate and publicize 

Recording: (7926/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7927/ 10721) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (7928/ 10721) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and long to the politicians that they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public instead of what we think to make our ourselves look great 

Recording: (7929/ 10721) 
yeah it is a qualitative type analysis 

Recording: (7930/ 10721) 
i do not really think there is any huge difference i can say from what i have seen the people catholic schools they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to organize their time better and things like that most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 

Recording: (7931/ 10721) 
and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when i was about like six years old i think and then they moved up to clintonville when i was about eight now my dad lives up in clintonville too 

Recording: (7932/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (7933/ 10721) 
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba to the united states that is found at sea is immediately to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what castro is that is the premise he is operating on in the news media they have not been real objective about it 

Recording: (7934/ 10721) 
i should not 

Recording: (7935/ 10721) 
i think columbus is really interesting how it develops compared to i do not know just how indianapolis how columbus is a a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and laid out compared to philadelphia or just when it was settled and when it was made just how more of the streets are more it is all like planned out more as opposed to like in in philly or places like that more east coast it is like the roads parts of them are real small and 

Recording: (7936/ 10721) 
our engineers are techies and are really into this in the forefront of ohio government along with the technology there has to also be the paperwork now i do not realize we have a paperless environment quoteunquote 

Recording: (7937/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7938/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (7939/ 10721) 
well i lived on 12th maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but that was just for a summer thing after i saw the couches being burned i said i said shoo no you are all right 

Recording: (7940/ 10721) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens many in my generation they would probably be i am the first of the baby boom that is when the women is movement started many men still have not accepted that for the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (7941/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7942/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7943/ 10721) 
but i think it should be an option i am really for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a i think that if we had a child it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it ultimately should be our choice i really do available especially when you are young no girl should have to go through pregnancy and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know 

Recording: (7944/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7945/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (7946/ 10721) 
and i think there is a whole bunch of people that just do not want to spend any extra money on anything we are already paying for enough of things we do not want to do this 

Recording: (7947/ 10721) 
the first year they made it instate only the second class that they are going to be starting they have some people from michigan i think 

Recording: (7948/ 10721) 
yeah real bad and it was you know mainly no one talked about it 

Recording: (7949/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (7950/ 10721) 
i can feed them and i can get them so that is how our life is mr mom 

Recording: (7951/ 10721) 
well my question is who is more important on the basketball team the five starters or the six men coming off the bench i ask you who ask george reese is he less important this year than he was last year 

Recording: (7952/ 10721) 
no i just like it anyway i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (7953/ 10721) 
yeah so and a lot of people turn 18 when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (7954/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7955/ 10721) 
could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (7956/ 10721) 
my favorite character on that show had always been chakotay and i do not like how his character i like the fact that he was someone who had been a starfleet officer but because of a matter of principle i left starfleet joined the maquis but was still fundamentally an honorable person 

Recording: (7957/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7958/ 10721) 
no what really when aids started i had a one of my best friend is brother had died of it and that really after that i was like i have to work on them because i was scared to death to get aids so i did work on them probably after a few years of having sex without condoms but 

Recording: (7959/ 10721) 
to be something that is going to make them change what is it going to be and how are realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than the government saying okay this is your cutoff limit 

Recording: (7960/ 10721) 
well yeah me either 

Recording: (7961/ 10721) 
convenient 

Recording: (7962/ 10721) 
so you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (7963/ 10721) 
i think it would probably i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (7964/ 10721) 
i mean 

Recording: (7965/ 10721) 
i am a professor i am doing studies here 

Recording: (7966/ 10721) 
i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (7967/ 10721) 
everybody is living longer there is more medical things where people can be healed from things that they could not be healed from so everybody today is living longer living basically as today as their future were back 30 years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow 

Recording: (7968/ 10721) 
like i do not know it is like it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is everything i guess 

Recording: (7969/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7970/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7971/ 10721) 
oh ok it does not have the equalizer thingy 

Recording: (7972/ 10721) 
all by yourself 

Recording: (7973/ 10721) 
i think i would say the same thing because of course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving learned a lot from her selflessness and 

Recording: (7974/ 10721) 
if you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean 

Recording: (7975/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (7976/ 10721) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (7977/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (7978/ 10721) 
i just go back and copycat something she said picking up that child and cuddling it and having that baby touch your skin and teaching what love is you do not necessarily necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother little brother 

Recording: (7979/ 10721) 
oh i think that is good 

Recording: (7980/ 10721) 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you are going to tell me that fog pushed that twofoot pine tree across the way i mean and it was a thick tree too and we get up to the next gas station he fills up and i listen on the intercom they had news on there weather and stuff tornado warning in that county i turned around i said now see who is the 

Recording: (7981/ 10721) 
i can see that like i said for me i kind of stay where i am it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more affect me personally maybe that is bad i do not know maybe i should feel guilty about that 

Recording: (7982/ 10721) 
you know we will take that as an insult 

Recording: (7983/ 10721) 
i do not even know what to say what a disgrace it is just embarrassing it really is 

Recording: (7984/ 10721) 
i think of it as a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which i have also been to of course 

Recording: (7985/ 10721) 
made to face their guilt and what they have done and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (7986/ 10721) 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything i went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big a thing except for the inplugged of the you know i did not realize how many were being drafted or being enlisted into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the country you know 

Recording: (7987/ 10721) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were going to buy houses in clintonville to hold them and rent them my problem is i do not have any money so that down payment has to be 10 down so that means i would have that tied up while i was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road for my kids to live in so my oldest girl when she was getting ready to move out she was like 24 and they could not find any place to live that i felt was safe and that was acceptable 

Recording: (7988/ 10721) 
well they only keep them there for a day or so and then they try to intervene with their family and put them back with their family maybe call in children is services and i just really do not think much of children is services so 

Recording: (7989/ 10721) 
and there and they have to deal with it 

Recording: (7990/ 10721) 
to get them thinking about it then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (7991/ 10721) 
the herbs the herbs 

Recording: (7992/ 10721) 
nah we are just both having to work there 

Recording: (7993/ 10721) 
my roommate 

Recording: (7994/ 10721) 
well yeah i might be wrong but you know we can not go backwards on that i do not think you can only work on your own 

Recording: (7995/ 10721) 
yeah of course you know babies tend not to be on time 

Recording: (7996/ 10721) 
at 9 30 10 oclock here in columbus and that is so cool i love going out clubbing at like 2 oclock in the morning red zone they open up at 9 or 10 oclock depending on if they have a special show coming in or not but that is the place i really like going up until usually 230 2 oclock all depends i also found something fascinating i came 

Recording: (7997/ 10721) 
i could fire them because they are gay i could care less 

Recording: (7998/ 10721) 
t 

Recording: (7999/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (8000/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8001/ 10721) 
yeah i have two other sisters one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced out of the five of us we are all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on our second except for one she is divorced and she has not remarried and then my oldest i told you in akron i guess she is not remarried 

Recording: (8002/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (8003/ 10721) 
and then when i got my master is no i did it during the weekends and the summer summers and the nights and it took me about well i started teaching in 1970 71 you 

Recording: (8004/ 10721) 
and research and stuff like that to do a lot of things that were done years ago 

Recording: (8005/ 10721) 
but it is really 

Recording: (8006/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8007/ 10721) 
we were inseparable from probably two weeks after we met i have not been without him 

Recording: (8008/ 10721) 
you know my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george orwell 1984 and big brother syndrome and all my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is gonna come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but to be 

Recording: (8009/ 10721) 
yeah we lived we moved about five or six years ago and the house we had before was some big like 80 90 year old house 

Recording: (8010/ 10721) 
i got him sounds like i bought a dog 

Recording: (8011/ 10721) 
yeah my best friend lives outside canberra and she has a lot of medical problems 

Recording: (8012/ 10721) 
yeah it worked out fine for us 

Recording: (8013/ 10721) 
they use drugs but not to the extreme that college students do 

Recording: (8014/ 10721) 
well yeah 

Recording: (8015/ 10721) 
cooper i just do not see him ever hugging the guys or saying great job or anything 

Recording: (8016/ 10721) 
to the hub which of course eliminated downtime but with that we were not in a position to monitor traffic 

Recording: (8017/ 10721) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (8018/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (8019/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (8020/ 10721) 
and he did that too 

Recording: (8021/ 10721) 
san diego is probably why yeah i have heard that is a nice place 

Recording: (8022/ 10721) 
i mean soon like fedex and all that is probably going to be there is probably going to be no one working there they are probably going to make it all machinery you know 

Recording: (8023/ 10721) 
because i was not allowed to wear jeans i was not allowed to wear tennis shoes 

Recording: (8024/ 10721) 
i mean that was a different time you know so nowadays it is a lot different you know 

Recording: (8025/ 10721) 
ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (8026/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8027/ 10721) 
period and it is a long process i mean this has been going on for 200 years this way and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (8028/ 10721) 
oh i am sorry yes besides our time is probably up i do not know 

Recording: (8029/ 10721) 
we pay like 40 or 50 here oh yeah well there is like you take federal and state and all that and i do not know 

Recording: (8030/ 10721) 
yeah if she passed 100 people and 99 of them said oh that is really pretty hair oh those are nice earrings oh that is a nice shirt those are nice pants and one guy goes what is with that lipstick she will remember that what is with that lipstick for about a month and i am like gosh you know you know and it is sad 

Recording: (8031/ 10721) 
okay so you are higher up there than i would be 

Recording: (8032/ 10721) 
definitely yeah like i said i do not have parts no different 

Recording: (8033/ 10721) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (8034/ 10721) 
how would you do this to me 

Recording: (8035/ 10721) 
there is a lot we need to do a lot of evolving we definitely do 

Recording: (8036/ 10721) 
does that mean 

Recording: (8037/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (8038/ 10721) 
i did have a job like that when i worked full time 

Recording: (8039/ 10721) 
does your husband like that 

Recording: (8040/ 10721) 
yeah it is difficult 

Recording: (8041/ 10721) 
i think that is bullshit 

Recording: (8042/ 10721) 
the cowboys yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (8043/ 10721) 
subjective right 

Recording: (8044/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8045/ 10721) 
and so it became a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable so maybe that is how having an effect maybe 50 years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trendsetting instead of stereotypical but i am sure it does have of some influence because i think it did it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces 

Recording: (8046/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8047/ 10721) 
to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was you know there was i had a friend that work for them so they did not know that and he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to installed supposed to have installed that was five feet higher three to five feet higher and shoulda woulda coulda you know if it 

Recording: (8048/ 10721) 
yeah well 

Recording: (8049/ 10721) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the that it is just like everything has changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain things we did or did not do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there were so many things that changed one thing that stands out and this has nothing to do with politics 

Recording: (8050/ 10721) 
like i said it would just be the old generations with the black president where now it would be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it i think that would be a bigger number 

Recording: (8051/ 10721) 
he is well yeah 

Recording: (8052/ 10721) 
well one of the things i am doing is i am applying for a number of research grants to go to germany and continue my research so hopefully i will get one of those i think i am in pretty good shape to get one of those so that might cause me to put off grad school for a year but i do not think that grad school will mind if i 

Recording: (8053/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8054/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (8055/ 10721) 
what do you do sit on the couch and watch tv and eat bonbons all day you know it is kind of 

Recording: (8056/ 10721) 
is it any worse than baseball cards 

Recording: (8057/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8058/ 10721) 
no asking each other opinions or anything like that 

Recording: (8059/ 10721) 
right where they go to the clinic sometimes and the clinic is basically a pill pop in place you know here take these you will feel better you know than they do really do not get any satisfaction for what they owe them you tell them you can not drink but yet you give them a pill that will give them the same effect you know peace 

Recording: (8060/ 10721) 
crummy new apartment buildings you know sloppily constructed yes yeah 

Recording: (8061/ 10721) 
it is and it was world war two that brought them together my my dad was in the at the end of the war he was in the army air corps he never had to go overseas but he was stationed in louisiana 

Recording: (8062/ 10721) 
they had to walk and i knew where they went and that was it they did not have the tv programs they have now they had more programs that were actually like i can not think of some of the names of them anymore 

Recording: (8063/ 10721) 
yeah well actually i do silk screening for tshirts for my like for like on the side for myself like to generate income and then also as of monday i am working at ohio it is an environmental group i will be doing canvassing type stuff just basically going door to door sign this petition 

Recording: (8064/ 10721) 
it is a lot bigger 

Recording: (8065/ 10721) 
i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (8066/ 10721) 
were like oh english people your accent is so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there and this was actually one of my friends but i remember she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she said like oh actually i should not be asking you i do not want to learn the american way to say those like i want to learn the british way people would say things all the time and they would ask you what your background was and if you would say well i am american they would say well where you are 

Recording: (8067/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8068/ 10721) 
mmhmm unless you know his dad was totally gone but he is been there ever since you know i was pregnant all through my pregnancy and he is been there for this whole two years i would not do that to him 

Recording: (8069/ 10721) 
or sustaining heat when heated by a fire 

Recording: (8070/ 10721) 
yeah my grandfather is dead and my grandma is still alive now she loves my son 

Recording: (8071/ 10721) 
probably not 

Recording: (8072/ 10721) 
the hours with because jason works during the day too so it would probably work out pretty well for us 

Recording: (8073/ 10721) 
i do not think it is the cartoons because come on if they are that stupid you know what i mean they should not even be out on the street i am sorry 

Recording: (8074/ 10721) 
and eventually get my own business where i have a want that i want to get a spiritual bookstore and have things for everybody you know just come in and reading room browse you know read this stuff you know take time off to relax because i think one of the problems with stress and i think people are right in saying that we do not get enough exercise but 

Recording: (8075/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8076/ 10721) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8077/ 10721) 
papers or whatever 

Recording: (8078/ 10721) 
no it was more black than white to tell you the truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now i live in a neighborhood where it is mostly black than white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (8079/ 10721) 
he is just sitting there okay that is not normal and he comes home you are talking to him yeah it is not like you are here to talk to 

Recording: (8080/ 10721) 
because i thought you know basically the city is been ran pretty well basically you know as far as cities are 

Recording: (8081/ 10721) 
uh case western you are not from around here are you 

Recording: (8082/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8083/ 10721) 
when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and most of the cops in the neighborhood knew i carried a gun 

Recording: (8084/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (8085/ 10721) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but if you put out the effort i really do not think there is that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (8086/ 10721) 
i do not know do it incrementally like you know like like like do like like hear a recitation and then kind of like work your way up 

Recording: (8087/ 10721) 
while they were here there were many people that were bad eggs man 

Recording: (8088/ 10721) 
right personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completely different background and everything else in education than most of the people that i know 

Recording: (8089/ 10721) 
or board games or just anything that happens to appeal 

Recording: (8090/ 10721) 
yeah it is and it seems to me that they do not keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of the like just below the absolute best in and it keeps a lot of them here 

Recording: (8091/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8092/ 10721) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (8093/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8094/ 10721) 
my sister had gone a couple times and basically took me aside and i have but one sibling and it is it is fun to have a sibling because nobody is more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with the inanity that is your family 

Recording: (8095/ 10721) 
have it meeting the missionaries 

Recording: (8096/ 10721) 
just walk in and start today or tell them hey the mets strike is over i am gone so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job oh yeah three weeks of pay it is cost yeah it costs quite a bit of money but you got some strike pay and this and that but it was not a lot you know $200 $200 a week is not much at all and when you have a family i mean $200 a week does not pay my daycare bill 

Recording: (8097/ 10721) 
take that away 

Recording: (8098/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8099/ 10721) 
as far as i was concerned for what they were doing one principal from my daughter is high school he was out partying all the time he was riding around in a corvette and he tried to take me out 

Recording: (8100/ 10721) 
i think that is a cop out myself 

Recording: (8101/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (8102/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (8103/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8104/ 10721) 
okay i might want to try to adjust this a little bit again if you see it goes under let me try putting it under here i do not know if that would help that was probably gonna stay better 

Recording: (8105/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (8106/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (8107/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8108/ 10721) 
well i have been in a lot more different cultures seen a lot more different people live found out how lucky i was 

Recording: (8109/ 10721)

i think he specializes in like solaris and hpux 

Recording: (8112/ 10721) 
i am sure australia welcomes all those dollars but they have a little wedding industry

daryl 

Recording: (8116/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8117/ 10721) 
hahaha 

Recording: (8118/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8119/ 10721) 
and they proceeded to set i think they set two of our guns the battery i mean the tires on fire 

Recording: (8120/ 10721) 
you know she goes dan 

Recording: (8121/ 10721) 
just 

Recording: (8122/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8123/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8124/ 10721) 
that is why you always hear about the bb gun 

Recording: (8125/ 10721) 
yeah i do not well that is fair maybe that is true too i mean i do not feel because you know when you are younger you think oh my god 27 that is so old you must be you know and now that you are here you are like i feel fine i do not feel like a little more responsible other than that 

Recording: (8126/ 10721) 
in high school yeah i was friends with most of them 

Recording: (8127/ 10721) 
at the beginning he did perfectly but now he is doing this i want up at 4 oclock kind of thing and give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep i do not want i do not want to walk all the way downstairs to make a bottle for a clock i can not see filling my way through the hallways and stuff 

Recording: (8128/ 10721) 
because it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (8129/ 10721) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the attorney got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and blew it so that was my responsibility my fault that you know how it was just years of pentup frustration and i just i 

Recording: (8130/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8131/ 10721) 
some of the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (8132/ 10721) 
so i think that is a problem too everybody says well i do not want to get there at 830 

Recording: (8133/ 10721) 
rate well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way it does not mean it is the right way and yeah i you know i really really struggle with that because i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going to do that or how the mentality to do that it seems like so like my dad it seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids you 

Recording: (8134/ 10721) 
be really rude not helpful 

Recording: (8135/ 10721) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before you was not even on campus it was over on like 4th or summit in a church when it first started it is just not you know people were always saying i can not believe how much you pay for daycare and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to 

Recording: (8136/ 10721) 
i have learned a lot it is been interesting i have liked my classes 

Recording: (8137/ 10721) 
once you are in it you have been in it and that is it i have 32 points 

Recording: (8138/ 10721) 
part it is a little bit much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me just all the sorts of changes and things like that going i mean there is no one watching every sandwich you have to do all the time and everything like that 

Recording: (8139/ 10721) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother and they will not allow dogs so she is not allowed to go over there so she is always like but it does make a big difference so i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8140/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8141/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8142/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8143/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8144/ 10721) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate he needs to know this piece of information and at the same time there is no way i could tell it to him yeah you do not know and there is nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily he said eventually he said it was sometime later when i actually found out what was going on i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count and figure out who is not there and assume something bad has happened but he said but it was a while before 

Recording: (8145/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8146/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (8147/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8148/ 10721) 
for him to not make the honor roll every time i could not even imagine what was happening with him and now he is completely back on track and doing really well and my eighth grade daughter is she is my kids are involved in all kinds of different things she is real involved with theater she is everything that comes along you know she wins the science fair she gets to the power of the pen she is on student count they all have lots of different kinds of things that they are involved in and that i am incredibly proud of them because they are just 

Recording: (8149/ 10721) 
much in school with that 

Recording: (8150/ 10721) 
as to what the sanctuary should be like so we had a tour the choir took a tour our choir director and arranged it to about five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them not for an audience but just to sing see which ones we liked the acoustics of and that was interesting we sang in the central presbyterian church you 

Recording: (8151/ 10721) 
yeah it is a good growing area the job prospects are a little scarce because of the smaller town yeah there is only about a 1 unemployment rate there 

Recording: (8152/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8153/ 10721) 
most of the trouble i have i got one neighbor that hates me and he is a sharer 

Recording: (8154/ 10721) 
нормально 

Recording: (8155/ 10721) 
like they are living together things like that 

Recording: (8156/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8157/ 10721) 
oh he is dead 

Recording: (8158/ 10721) 
that is right well they do not they do not they do not give them i do not know maybe they give each one one free ticket or something you rest of them have to pay ha ha ha ha 

Recording: (8159/ 10721) 
i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and there are teachers there ticket takers monitoring the crowd wherever the kids i ask them i said do you you ever go home no oh yeah but they are always there they are not there just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are there after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy 

Recording: (8160/ 10721) 
that makes sense and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather rather than watch a 21 ballgame 

Recording: (8161/ 10721) 
neither was i i really was not and it is funny i just this summer went to my 25th high school reunion 

Recording: (8162/ 10721) 
hmm how would you end up in ohio 

Recording: (8163/ 10721) 
those are your 

Recording: (8164/ 10721) 
and dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with the parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being and shown and have access to 

Recording: (8165/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8166/ 10721) 
plus with the internet and everything they have access to so much information i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (8167/ 10721) 
she said well you have to take a foreign language i said look i am not taking any more foreign languages we are going to figure out how to avoid this no you have to take a foreign i said look lady there are 60000 students in this university and if you think that i am going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the college of foreign language you are insane there is another way to do this experience what is it you have to take a foreign language i said okay we are going to change the question a little bit here you have two options now tell me how to avoid taking a foreign language or tell me how to talk to somebody who is not you because that is apparently all i 

Recording: (8168/ 10721) 
oh yeah you just send that right all over but you do not want to tell how many people live in your house 

Recording: (8169/ 10721) 
not in sort of an evil sense necessarily but just in sort of a challenging sense consistently yes there was some sort of inherent communication breakdown my mother is kind of a flake not that i am not a flake but we are flaking in different ways 

Recording: (8170/ 10721) 
that ru 

Recording: (8171/ 10721) 
in your address you did not even have to write it you just had to know how to say it in your phone number and recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills and that was about all they expect you to do you to play cooperatively that is about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten they expect you to know all

Recording: (8175/ 10721)

Recording: (8181/ 10721) 
yeah and the smaller house like bigger squished in areas are the older area

Recording: (8183/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (8184/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8185/ 10721) 
i mean i think they could try if their kids try to push them away they should not let their kids push them away i guess you can not make your kid go out with you and do things 

Recording: (8186/ 10721) 
yeah exactly it is a very conservative town 

Recording: (8187/ 10721) 
i forklift back there and you are not going to just dodge that 

Recording: (8188/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8189/ 10721) 
it is like i guess i can apply for welfare in that 

Recording: (8190/ 10721) 
and i did a lot of music interviewing and writing there and then i moved up to editor and it was sort of through that job that i got my first job with sony while i was as a sort of ohio representative so i was concentrated in ohio state and then you know basically it is just something i am not doing this as a career it is just sort of something i am doing in the meantime until i decide whether i am going back to school or not 

Recording: (8191/ 10721)

one of the hardest 

Recording: (8196/ 10721) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i have only ever known one male that taught first grade and i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go into elementary ed they go for the upper grades like 4 5 or 6 but i really think that if we let the boys always be more exposed to men earlier then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girly thing 

Recording: (8197/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (8198/ 10721)

Recording: (8227/ 10721) 
personally no i do not think so 

Recording: (8228/ 10721) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtowns i mean you know it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you are out so i do not think that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice 

Recording: (8229/ 10721) 
biology experience 

Recording: (8230/ 10721)

you know 

Recording: (8258/ 10721)

Recording: (8259/ 10721)

but with people coming back later and saying that they changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that that is not going to happen in this case i do not think and because of her age and this makes no sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for 72 hours before she could give it up for adoption because of her age it does not make any sense to me so they are talking to a social worker now 

Recording: (8355/ 10721)

in most school districts it is comparable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think twentysix eight or something of course worthington is one of the three highest paid districts in ohio it used to be that teachers just got paid lower than starting firemen or starting policemen

you mentioned earlier about how this would affect the children with this twoyear welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for whatever reason i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who really need it and who are really taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like 

Recording: (8502/ 10721) 
i think it does i like to exercise i think it is fun i would just do it four hours a day if i could do that although i have not for the last six weeks i have not anything because it is just i have had these other things that are that are really pressing you know how that is you get you have some things you just have to get done and then when i get this stuff cleared out there will be a break and then i will be able to get back back to it 

Recording: (8503/ 10721) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (8504/ 10721) 
not like i am

Recording: (8510/ 10721) 
please 

Recording: (8511/ 10721) 
i think i did not know the difference so it did not affect me at all they are just another person i think more as i am being exposed to patients with a different different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need i felt somewhat illequipped the first few times but knowing what the expectations are especially with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into sexuality and teaching them after injury 

Recording: (8512/ 10721) 
and you screwed something up 

Recording: (8513/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8514/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (8515/ 10721)

Recording: (8517/ 10721) 
were true that some of them had good things but they were not exactly hitting the mark 

Recording: (8518/ 10721) 
because i tell her things like i said you know what you really need to do is like in the morning when you are all done dressing you look at the mirror and go i look pretty good today or when you have done something like say uh she is in a play right now and when you come home at night you need to look in the mirror and go i did pretty good at the play today other people did well but i think i did the best i have done so far and it is not to make yourself an egomaniac it is just a you know that is like those little subtle hints 

Recording: (8519/ 10721) 
well you watch the movie and you are like 

Recording: (8520/ 10721) 
which is a government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and because i already have a bachelor is they will not pay for school now if i were stupid you know if i just had a basic just got out of grade school i did not even have my ged boy they would pay for my high school my college and everything even living expenses 

Recording: (8521/ 10721) 
what is really weird is i go to my mom is neighborhood and you will still see kids playing out there in the schoolyard playing baseball now i got a schoolyard right next to me you come up there and you see no kids doing it 

Recording: (8522/ 10721) 
and you get the shooting out in honolulu and the next day there is another one it is just kind of like that syndrome you know well at least i can be popular for 15 minutes it stuff that is just ridiculous 

Recording: (8523/ 10721) 
right anybody with that bush 

Recording: (8524/ 10721) 
okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how to spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestibules 

Recording: (8525/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8526/ 10721) 
oh man 

Recording: (8527/ 10721) 
i do 

Recording: (8528/ 10721) 
but she is out there somewhere again we do not have clear evidence where she is there were a couple of times where where we thought we knew where samantha was when there were all those clones of her i think that was in the second season or so i think if they were going to end it they were going to have to have three episodes in a row that were tying up all these 

Recording: (8529/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8530/ 10721) 
and that was very stressful 

Recording: (8531/ 10721) 
it burned his he got his hands up in front of his face so it did not burn his face but it burned his legs and his stomach 

Recording: (8532/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (8533/ 10721) 
i mean the way i grew up it was probably like back in the day like catholics against the columbus publics you know the richies against the poories that is how i kind of see it but when i went to northland people think northland is like a rich school but the way i see it is no not really i mean we do live in a big house area the houses are like huge but you 

Recording: (8534/ 10721) 
i am sure it probably will 

Recording: (8535/ 10721) 
basically you know we used to be able to go to the woods and everything else now you do not even see merrygorounds on the playground because people would sue over it yeah no offense people are ridiculous us 

Recording: (8536/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8537/ 10721) 
did he really 

Recording: (8538/ 10721) 
and one of them set fire to the other one 

Recording: (8539/ 10721) 
okay so it is just like an independent contractor for them 

Recording: (8540/ 10721) 
i will just keep them as friends that works 

Recording: (8541/ 10721) 
yeah yeah like 

Recording: (8542/ 10721)

Recording: (8544/ 10721) 
tennessee they are even friendlier in some places 

Recording: (8545/ 10721) 
and so i give her most credit for 

Recording: (8546/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8547/ 10721) 
we want to serve you they did not get that at all they were like ooh some people would just be like no no way that does not make sense 

Recording: (8548/ 10721) 
people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but in my mother used to say the same thing about our generation so i think it is just a sign of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (8549/ 10721) 
but other ones you have to take the full major some people are doing gosh i think one is doing business and one is doing economics 

Recording: (8550/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (8551/ 10721) 
no that is one thing that i found was really lacking here for my son 

Recording: (8552/ 10721) 
i think it is been good i mean the economy has been very good it seems like society seems to be improving moving you know even though we talked about this 

Recording: (8553/ 10721) 
yeah jason and i went together 

Recording: (8554/ 10721) 
no kidding 

Recording: (8555/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (8556/ 10721) 
yeah like a little kid and he did not say anything to me but he made my aunt feel like a little pile of dirt sister and so he just really showed out that day but what is so funny is our baby my dad has red hair and our baby has red hair 

Recording: (8557/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (8558/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8559/ 10721) 
needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit business said hey let us produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (8560/ 10721) 
saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and they were not going to let me throw my life away like this it was bizarre so i was always from that time on i decided these people are all crazy i am never going to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values from my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (8561/ 10721) 
drove me nuts say a few words for posterity he would say and we would say get out of here 

Recording: (8562/ 10721) 
i get a job at hyde park it is just amazing because the money is so good you really can not beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever i did that all through high school and college i graduated from high school i managed a restaurant for about a year and a half 

Recording: (8563/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (8564/ 10721) 
right it is bad it is bad on the other hand it is not good to let your mind wander off somewhere i find myself having to focus sometimes i mean to really 

Recording: (8565/ 10721) 
yeah probably have to go to dublin or worthington somewhere around there to find a couple millionaires but 

Recording: (8566/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (8567/ 10721) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8568/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (8569/ 10721) 
it is like a mail order catalog thing and uh so uh people are really really incompetent it is really funny like for some people i do not know how they even some people who can not speak english even well enough i do not know how they got signed up or how they even have a credit card to order i mean until you can tell especially when people call from all over it is really funny to talk to people from alabama or south carolina i never knew people from south carolina had such thick accents i never really thought of 

Recording: (8570/ 10721) 
yeah i like baseball i used to like that a lot better when i was younger but no i would not take the time to sit and watch a whole baseball game on tv 

Recording: (8571/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (8572/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (8573/ 10721) 
not doing anything my son you know with his disorder he would constantly be late for school and i called the school and told them this was in high school 

Recording: (8574/ 10721) 
bars and every once in a while there will be a fight and it is still i mean it still is disturbing to me i have a distinct difference in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like are not making that distinction but i do not think so and i think if someone is not making that distinction it is i do not know 

Recording: (8575/ 10721) 
get into school and they get violent and they take it out and everybody is surprised i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and going to school is going to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different backgrounds and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on 

Recording: (8576/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (8577/ 10721) 
so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will get yeah it is against the union contract you had to say it 

Recording: (8578/ 10721) 
yeah i think they are twofaced 

Recording: (8579/ 10721) 
i mean he would have been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there and while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh oh man it is a hilarious story i mean 30 foot moving truck i am sleeping in it and i get 

Recording: (8580/ 10721) 
well one would hope that there would be enough education on the subject that the kids would not think it was that odd 

Recording: (8581/ 10721) 
yeah like it is killing its own citizens it is so ridiculous 

Recording: (8582/ 10721) 
i agree with everything he has said but i am a little more i do not know what the right word is to say here but sometimes i think politics are they are a little bit dirty 

Recording: (8583/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8584/ 10721) 
group of five guys who know each other 

Recording: (8585/ 10721)

snobs i am from palo alto do not talk to me you know you are not you are not you are not worthy 

Recording: (8587/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (8588/ 10721) 
yeah if i had stayed for the fourth year when we would do a lot of of making up a portfolio that kind of thing i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i probably would have stayed but it was 

Recording: (8589/ 10721) 
same 

Recording: (8590/ 10721) 
um i first of all could not be referred 

Recording: (8591/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8592/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (8593/ 10721) 
exactly but i do there is the other side with native americans too it is you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly giving up your children and something has to be done but there is also that i mean i think it is probably legitimate fear that children of that group are going to be homogenized out of their heritage 

Recording: (8594/ 10721) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before you just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (8595/ 10721) 
i was like a rebel you know i did not really it was not really my cup of tea actually i had a pretty decent job i worked four and a half days a week basically in the electro mechanical type of things you know remove and replace what they do a lot now with cars they put a thing on a machine and says take that out out you know try it you know you put that in so in hindsight you know it was cool but i had i like to 

Recording: (8596/ 10721) 
four five six seven eight nine ten just to get a volume level 

Recording: (8597/ 10721) 
and then you come here you know what i mean you see people stand out on street corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (8598/ 10721) 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military as long as people do not know they do not feel threatened i do not understand that mindset i really do not i do not know why a man feels threatened by having a gay near them i have a couple of gay friends and one of my friends always says does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted to every woman does he want to go to bed with every woman what makes a man think that just because 

Recording: (8599/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8600/ 10721) 
yeah you just find it i can do anything i want yeah 

Recording: (8601/ 10721) 
and i am going to hold you to this confidentiality because very few people know about this 

Recording: (8602/ 10721) 
of at the same time every day 

Recording: (8603/ 10721) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (8604/ 10721) 
yeah yeah archbishop romero yeah in el salvador that is right that is right that is right yes so there are conservative and progressive wings every religion i am sure even probably unitarian universalist although i have heard 

Recording: (8605/ 10721) 
i have been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up with like heroin and things like that 

Recording: (8606/ 10721) 
basically last time i heard he was doing lawn care he is done about everything like i told him you know get as many jobs as you can until you figure out what you want to do he is done maintenance work he is done sales work he is doing lawn care now he is done gardening uh his girlfriend they live together he is not married like i said he is got a kid they have been together for about four years but uh 

Recording: (8607/ 10721) 
no that is interesting though because i think that my whole i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (8608/ 10721) 
for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be really interesting and help me feel like you know helping people they give new direction for abused wives and mothers and help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that 

Recording: (8609/ 10721) 
or a town 

Recording: (8610/ 10721) 
i can not believe it that just blows my mind you can spend all thousands of dollars just for a wedding 

Recording: (8611/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8612/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8613/ 10721) 
i think it is the combination plus i think the dressing is my sister is recipe for dressing balsamic vinegar dressing with olive oil and garlic it is just a real good dressing i tend to use that most times and everything being chilled just nicely chilled and all that sort of thing 

Recording: (8614/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8615/ 10721) 
yeah i mean you know signing oh here you go hon the one i think is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that should not have happened and the other one yeah you just let us face it at that age and at every age we want a leader and i guess it goes back if we choose to or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we will make better decisions of who is going to lead us 

Recording: (8616/ 10721) 
a lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethel and 315 or things like that 

Recording: (8617/ 10721)

Recording: (8716/ 10721) 
i am like ah for some reason i am supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are always looking for reasons you are asking me i am looking for reasons but a lot of times you can not give a reason it just happens why did you marry your husband how did you meet your husband how did he come about how did the passing go to explain that to your offspring someday

transportation issue i thought that rail system looked kind of cool which is kind of tough the question is do we want to spend the money money on it and would people actually use it i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you are looking at people driving both ways and i think if people are actually going to make it so people are going to use it i think it would probably be a pretty good thing to have and i voted for it i can not believe you are going to do that 

Recording: (8727/ 10721) 
because of your internal clock 

Recording: (8728/ 10721)

register parents because many of them do not vote and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are i i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not i had to wait until i was 21 so there were a bunch of us at college that 

Recording: (8740/ 10721) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah and with their children the types of parenting you do with your children a lot of mainstream americans look at them like that is so weird i

this is my senior year i am graduating in june 

Recording: (8743/ 10721) 
and teresa the founder also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children 

Recording: (8744/ 10721) 
really see we almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it is certainly 

Recording: (8745/ 10721) 
the gossip i heard was that the superintendent of schools said that if he was reelected she was going to resign and so they gave her a big raise he must be a thorn in her side 

Recording: (8746/ 10721)

Recording: (8747/ 10721) 
what we should buy yeah the retail what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (8748/ 10721) 
i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory sexual harassment tapes and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel is constituted as your harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that there is crushes you can not fault the girls for having crushes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (8749/ 10721) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law you know it could be something real real technical or something that a threeyearold could answer because it is trying to hit all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (8750/ 10721)

Recording: (8758/ 10721) 
with their cycle that is the way the indian people many of the women refer to it as they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that life women have that gift of life that they can give men can not do that there is just a lot there that women go through that purification every month 

Recording: (8759/ 10721) 
and i was there three months before i got hit with a racial discrimination suit but then i found out later this woman had in the 20 years she would been there had filed 20 suits so

mmhmm 

Recording: (8761/ 10721) 
not to happen and then she ended up getting transferred to st louis from here so it was something that really would not have been able to happened when she moved out there and that was a 90 so 

Recording: (8762/ 10721) 
well i mean as i mean like i was saying i he is at the ages where he needs to you know start learning things and she just does not do that and that is probably the way she raised her kids but no we have totally different opinions about everything 

Recording: (8763/ 10721)

Recording: (8764/ 10721) 
have nuns or anything there i mean you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort 

Recording: (8765/ 10721) 
it is more feasible than a sixyearold 

Recording: (8766/ 10721) 
because i had a lot of frustration build up what is next get a whole list there

i do not think that i would have him go to any i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party that kind of stuff was a lot more focused than i mean i do not think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my parents so i mean it was interesting i mean it was a lot more culture all kinds of things do a lot of things with nature and that was the 70s too so you have to look at the time what we are talking about

Recording: (8807/ 10721) 
i was going to then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in capital punishment but that was one comment she was talking about but then on the very very opposite extreme extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and 

Recording: (8808/ 10721) 
i do not i do not 

Recording: (8809/ 10721) 
do you have a three oclock 

Recording: (8810/ 10721)

yes 

Recording: (8815/ 10721) 
yay joe 

Recording: (8816/ 10721) 
and then in a little bit there is another one the other side of us 

Recording: (8817/ 10721) 
i should not be having to clean quite as much as i do now i would say by 10 they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do my most of it by themselves i know i did it and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help a lot around the house 

Recording: (8818/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (8819/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8820/ 10721) 
it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafias do not get paid 

Recording: (8821/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8822/ 10721) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her but back then and nobody would talk about it and i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out because there are so many people who are ashamed about things and they should not be ashamed because it is a lifestyle anymore it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (8823/ 10721) 
terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is a most thing that ever was passed i do not think should be any plea bargains and then there are people who get murdered and sent to the electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is and i do not believe that they should have 10 years of what do they call that legal process where they can bring appeals thank you that is it 

Recording: (8824/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (8825/ 10721)

Recording: (8827/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (8828/ 10721) 
that is all 

Recording: (8829/ 10721)

why is that 

Recording: (8834/ 10721) 
but yet they want to lay off people that actually need the jobs 

Recording: (8835/ 10721) 
um i really did not no 

Recording: (8836/ 10721)

Recording: (8837/ 10721)

Recording: (8849/ 10721) 
i am sorry 

Recording: (8850/ 10721)

rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about you know 12 year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurse is office is one thing they are there you know they can go in and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating in that 

Recording: (8860/ 10721)

Recording: (8882/ 10721)

Recording: (8883/ 10721) 
and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (8884/ 10721) 
they are like three times more price wise 

Recording: (8885/ 10721) 
that is just like i told them take everything you got that your real father got you 

Recording: (8886/ 10721) 
and i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it was pretty old and they were just things that he would do and i guess just picking up watching him seeing what he would do 

Recording: (8887/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (8888/ 10721) 
now i feel like you do not have to go to church to believe in god and all that i talk to them i talk to my grandparents that are in heaven and stuff that is just what i was raised as 

Recording: (8889/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8890/ 10721) 
the 

Recording: (8891/ 10721) 
yeah you have to concentrate on what is important or it just flies by and you do not even see it yeah 

Recording: (8892/ 10721) 
i have been back there for about 10 10 years i would like to move back down there but there just is not any work you know it is unless you own your own company so that basically basically as remodeling drywall stuff like that 

Recording: (8893/ 10721) 
hahaha 

Recording: (8894/ 10721) 
of course my wife is worked in higher education for 30 years so 

Recording: (8895/ 10721) 
i was a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union i did that for a couple of years until i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts i did that that is kind of stressful so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that 

Recording: (8896/ 10721) 
and they see the same thing smeared back to them because we are making christ is images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do positive today and build on the positive it may have been the smallest part of that paper 

Recording: (8897/ 10721) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we knew a lot of stuff we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are gonna regret this someday i said another ten years we will be pleased but we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent i guess the point that when we were first married it was hard to make a simple decision on anything we have worked through that after 25 years 

Recording: (8898/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (8899/ 10721) 
kept promoting and then all of a sudden about the 90s they came around and said hey you know what our deficit is going the other way we are going way out of whack on this thing that is because we have been spending more consumers are doing the same thing they have not learned that mom and dad remember mom went out and got little pieces of time as they needed things no i am with the whole house completely for 

Recording: (8900/ 10721) 
it is very informal here so i do not know what we were doing but 

Recording: (8901/ 10721) 
and i am not quite sure how to address that because some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of both sides of your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (8902/ 10721) 
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in reston virginia so they did they are all married well three are married yeah 

Recording: (8903/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (8904/ 10721) 
and it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job anyhow just kind of one of those okay let us do it 

Recording: (8905/ 10721) 
well i was with mormons so i do not know if you have ever seen how they go two by two always i was with what we call another sister and we would live in an apartment and we would pay for our own mission and there was a mission president and they had different people with responsibilities leaders and they would watch over you and make sure you know call every night and check on you but it was really 

Recording: (8906/ 10721) 
and then ohio and then back down to tennessee and then back to ohio 

Recording: (8907/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8908/ 10721) 
that we have talked about before but could not really do very well so it is pretty neat 

Recording: (8909/ 10721) 
and stuff but that does not get to express my creative side as much so it would be my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well and like would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (8910/ 10721) 
well because my cousins and they all have a they are very you know welleducated educated and they are more affluent and i think that maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 

Recording: (8911/ 10721) 
both times i stayed around this little town it is like northwest of munich so it was southern most brooklyn 

Recording: (8912/ 10721) 
well you know in my girls there are certain products that brand name like one of them i know is the meyer pudding that you can take for lunches which they do and it is like ed venture every once in a while hunts will be the same price and there will be a coupon on the paper so joyce we trade she is 

Recording: (8913/ 10721) 
and we called it the taj mahal because they would spilled bunches of information into it or bunches of money 

Recording: (8914/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8915/ 10721) 
and that is when i said no 

Recording: (8916/ 10721) 
have you ever been there 

Recording: (8917/ 10721) 
child abuse

Recording: (8919/ 10721) 
oh it does yeah 

Recording: (8920/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8921/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (8922/ 10721) 
to gi is 

Recording: (8923/ 10721) 
because they got beaches and yeah i do not think lake erie can compare that would hurt 

Recording: (8924/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8925/ 10721) 
oh yeah i would say so 

Recording: (8926/ 10721) 
i am just an operator right now i have done production work too for them 

Recording: (8927/ 10721) 
yeah he uses a lot of different slurs towards gay people 

Recording: (8928/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (8929/ 10721) 
because the therapist did it yeah 

Recording: (8930/ 10721) 
businessmen my dad and i have been screwing around with stocks for years i have been in contact with a day trading firm down in west virginia and they are starting an intern program sometime i do not even know win but if that opens up i will probably seriously consider going down to west virginia i have been saying west virginia have not i they are in virginia sorry their home base is in richmond virginia 

Recording: (8931/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah but many people especially the kid that young may not know what that really means and may as to be part of the group and part of the you know be cool may go along with it when really they do not like it i do not i have not made up my mind about him whether he is telling the truth or whether he has not or whether he was not 

Recording: (8932/ 10721) 
the day i left the hospital he was running around with him 

Recording: (8933/ 10721) 
the big boys get all the breaks so in my opinion the judge did not want to hear the case before then or maybe his docket was full but i am saying there is no prioritization in the legal system there are some things that should be addressed soon have to wait that long but so then came down to one week prior to the hearing and 

Recording: (8934/ 10721) 
oh my 

Recording: (8935/ 10721) 
we want a dog and we have kind of been waiting but i like both animals 

Recording: (8936/ 10721) 
because the larger story was too large to film in one movie but this one as a part of a whole i am reserving complete judgment until 

Recording: (8937/ 10721) 
well i think 

Recording: (8938/ 10721) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education 

Recording: (8939/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (8940/ 10721) 
an urban area 

Recording: (8941/ 10721) 
but even though you are not responsible i am the one that is supposed to be responsible the people that have the beer party in the house yeah they should be held responsible to some degree but we are in a society that loves to sue people 

Recording: (8942/ 10721) 
my parents are all for it they have always been supportive of whatever we wanted 

Recording: (8943/ 10721) 
it is like you know you get to know everybody it is pretty much an apartment and the whole floor you know you become friends with everybody real fast so i am hoping that is the same deal when i travel it is like it is easy to make friends and hook up and say oh you got a job hook me up 

Recording: (8944/ 10721) 
and i have an office within the program now and yeah and it is just incredible how much i have learned i think i learned more in that program than i do in all my classes put together 

Recording: (8945/ 10721) 
for example so you should name her tamara 

Recording: (8946/ 10721) 
get something approved through all the parameters you got to go through and everything and then they start working on it and then they get it done it is already 10 15 years old 

Recording: (8947/ 10721) 
can i just say yes i like lots of stuff i like games 

Recording: (8948/ 10721) 
everything keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of scissors 

Recording: (8949/ 10721) 
yeah but they do not have it 

Recording: (8950/ 10721) 
i play with computers normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day or what i did the day before if they ask me in the evening so what did i do today internet information server is a product by microsoft it lets you house web pages and put them out on the web on the web indexserve is another product that lets you put search engines on that then there is another product by a company called splitcycle it is called netstock it sucks netstock 

Recording: (8951/ 10721) 
and it is you know my mom you know she always said well what is you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of this a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (8952/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (8953/ 10721) 
well yeah in a case like that the parents should know because there is something going on 

Recording: (8954/ 10721) 
saying that if you have a fourth or a half 

Recording: (8955/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (8956/ 10721) 
i mean obviously being a little boy i remember seeing things like football or whatever you would see something and you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8957/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (8958/ 10721) 
and so it was kind of funny but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (8959/ 10721) 
my kids went to a school where my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said we are closing next year and it was hard but once it is reached the point that decision is made and announced then there were good reasons for it and they explain the reasons and at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something 

Recording: (8960/ 10721) 
usually every weekend 

Recording: (8961/ 10721) 
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or the other 

Recording: (8962/ 10721) 
i thought it was very strange but 

Recording: (8963/ 10721) 
it is just older artists more established artists 

Recording: (8964/ 10721) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (8965/ 10721) 
is that just because of the wall go visit the wall what do you think i think i remember that when they took down the wall the brandenburg gates or something like that i remember hearing that mmhmm 

Recording: (8966/ 10721) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they did not know i was going to do this so after they got it all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread my peanut butter my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no adlibbing no adding no taking away read exactly what i am saying what you wrote 

Recording: (8967/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8968/ 10721) 
why people 

Recording: (8969/ 10721) 
kent merker which are a couple of guys that did get signed professionally and are playing right now so at least i can say i played against them him and at least with kent merker i can say i hit a home run off him so it was a while ago but it was when he was young and very good and i was three or four years older and still took him deep to center field so i will never forget that 

Recording: (8970/ 10721) 
i know i know i know i mean i started 

Recording: (8971/ 10721) 
where northland is 

Recording: (8972/ 10721) 
well the thing i mean i know when my mom my mom has a friend that adopted 

Recording: (8973/ 10721) 
yeah meet different people 

Recording: (8974/ 10721) 
well that is not their sperm or whatever that is they sell for ten thousand dollars a piece and be implanted another so they take and produce a quote beautiful child well a beautiful child and if you are talking about just the physical features is meaningless it is what is embodied in the child that body that can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is abhorrent 

Recording: (8975/ 10721) 
so they spent all these thousands of dollars on airfare and they are still coming out ahead maybe they should get to one of those las vegas chapel weddings and do like a drivethru they really want to do it on the cheap i did not have elvis as a performance ceremony that is crazy 

Recording: (8976/ 10721) 
kill 

Recording: (8977/ 10721) 
oh okay

Recording: (9024/ 10721) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good set my best friend is a realtor she is since retired but it is so funny because she would always go through all these statistics and this and that because the stuff i have done is in and because i live in area and so she would say oh i do not know and she said well how much do you have to get it for and how much and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under $150 i probably can sell it for $140 if i do this this this and this now you are going to put a lot of money into that though it is not like you are still only getting 

Recording: (9025/ 10721)

gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (9028/ 10721)

Recording: (9029/ 10721) 
i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know 

Recording: (9030/ 10721) 
well because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be the first to know that there is a lot of favoritism you know some teachers will teach one but not teach the other 

Recording: (9031/ 10721) 
the arts it was called and that was interesting it is kind of an underclass of teachers they do not pay enough to do that they pay you per student contact hour and in my case chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like 21 or 22 

Recording: (9032/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9033/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9034/ 10721) 
on 

Recording: (9035/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9036/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (9037/ 10721) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught the only thing probably is like what do they call that cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to 

Recording: (9038/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (9039/ 10721) 
yeah but some names are just like we had a friend once she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not have never expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and the mother is name was harriet 

Recording: (9040/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9041/ 10721) 
yes but there is nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured something weird is going on i did not know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce related they did not just basically dumb because the divorce was not going to phase me because the entire marriage was we knew we knew from the beginning that was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so we are just kind of waiting around going they are gonna be doors for a couple months and sure enough so anyway so i look at these people and their names are the 

Recording: (9042/ 10721) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people the pets say but it is just i could not be around that i would go off on people that would do that bring that in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth sometimes i am not a violent man either as big as i am you know so 

Recording: (9043/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9044/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9045/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9046/ 10721) 
i do somewhat just not a one of them i just got back from lunch with i mean i see him 

Recording: (9047/ 10721) 
where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is some 30 40 years ago where they had their white organizations or whatnot and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (9048/ 10721) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (9049/ 10721) 
right yeah well you can not even put a price on it either 

Recording: (9050/ 10721) 
in a hole and i was still shaking but i do not remember i think they put one of our guns out of commission that time but they did not do as much damage as they might have 

Recording: (9051/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9052/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9053/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9054/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9055/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9056/ 10721) 
where it is more cohesive within the catholic school it seems to be very clear they are all going in the same direction working as a team uh i do not know if you ever listened to any of the columbus board of education meetings are on the radio 

Recording: (9057/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9058/ 10721)

i never liked meat my parents always made me eat it once i went away to college and i said i am not going to eat anymore and they are like oh well we will see and i have never eaten anything since and we will see you next time 

Recording: (9066/ 10721) 
no no in fact the principal when she interviewed me asked me that and i said when we are raised in the unitarian sunday school it is a it is almost an indoctrination and tolerance for other religions so you are better off with me than somebody that believes theirs is the only one true religion 

Recording: (9067/ 10721) 
i just hope she adjusts 

Recording: (9068/ 10721) 
they say 

Recording: (9069/ 10721)

ncr paper he did not have to write you know if he was not getting the notes 

Recording: (9073/ 10721) 
which we encourage that 

Recording: (9074/ 10721) 
to all of the stuff and then you pretend that you are a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case and going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me my family my mom and dad well my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungary and that was a neat experience i liked growing up there up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in hungary he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do 

Recording: (9075/ 10721) 
value and why are you doing this to my kid so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools so it just seems to be more distraction from the educational process when you are in a catholic school and you are in a classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to of course part of the way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time 

Recording: (9076/ 10721) 
you know so unfortunately you know and i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressure is put on schools and education now 

Recording: (9077/ 10721) 
and i was more surprised that they found a lot of alcohol you know some people if they do drugs at school and stuff i am not saying that is right but they will do it but alcohol it would be so hard to hide because it smells and you have got to hold it out but they found bottles of liquor 

Recording: (9078/ 10721) 
425 

Recording: (9079/ 10721) 
those things are hard as hell to scratch 

Recording: (9080/ 10721) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out just come came back a couple months ago my grandfather just passed away but he was here and a nursing home for about a year 

Recording: (9081/ 10721) 
well see my husband would do that it is so bizarre because i honestly do not i think that is where his brain is completely lacking i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says i am not a good judge of that i 

Recording: (9082/ 10721) 
in the dorms too and i really did not like that it was like living in a hotel or something it was really weird 

Recording: (9083/ 10721)

Recording: (9084/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (9085/ 10721)

Recording: (9086/ 10721) 
i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about as far as your student loans and being able to get into scala which has helped me as far as some of the issues go i feel pretty similar to the way he does i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not know i mean i do not 

Recording: (9087/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9088/ 10721)

i am not sending him to a columbus public school but an alternative school i will send him to school i do not i would if i had the money to tell you the truth i would most definitely but i know i could not afford it that is why i have never thought thought about it really 

Recording: (9094/ 10721) 
i think that 

Recording: (9095/ 10721) 
but they did not seem to have grown up in this terrible environment and have that sort of precondition or anything like that yeah i think a lot more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know placate those sort of situations i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things i 

Recording: (9096/ 10721) 
deep space nine in that they address the issue of different people living and working together you have different people of different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denominations of humans but it approached that from a less from a more realistic standpoint instead of having an old star trek everyone gets along then we come to 

Recording: (9097/ 10721) 
i hate life 

Recording: (9098/ 10721) 
as far as being heterosexual so i mean i really can not say that i would see that affecting the kids 

Recording: (9099/ 10721) 
and i think that that is one of the things they can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence a lot of kids it is taking over their life if it is not that now it is worse yet it is the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you could walk in and sit and turn it off now you can go in i guess and see what they are on the internet honestly now sorry you can not in the internet anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program 

Recording: (9100/ 10721) 
she did go and see a psychologist a child psychologist or something and she was real bitter about the divorce feeling that she was turn the cars off

Recording: (9108/ 10721) 
i know i was thinking that before when you were telling me stuff 

Recording: (9109/ 10721) 
yeah it got boring it got frustrating because we get these new people moving in and you are used to everything being nice and then you get people next door breaking into you or upstairs from you breaking into you 

Recording: (9110/ 10721)

Recording: (9128/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9129/ 10721)

Recording: (9136/ 10721)

Recording: (9137/ 10721) 
i mean i am sure at 19 i was saying some really bizarre things too but you can tell that he is thought about it

Recording: (9145/ 10721)

all this other stuff 

Recording: (9179/ 10721) 
connecting some wires are crossed up here or something and so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying

Recording: (9187/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9188/ 10721) 
i know that is a lot easier said than done because you fall in love every other week sometimes when you are young but i do not think it encourages it i just think you know they should show and stuff it is a different story so they are seeing it anyways i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say

Recording: (9204/ 10721) 
they ai not gonna lock me up 

Recording: (9205/ 10721) 
i and 

Recording: (9206/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9207/ 10721) 
yeah it basically feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes exorbitantly high it is a little higher but it is not ridiculous ridiculously high 

Recording: (9208/ 10721) 
what would you do 

Recording: (9209/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9210/ 10721)

and then attending grad school 

Recording: (9215/ 10721) 
i mean even someplace as simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we will spend a good half hour 45 minutes just driving around till we actually decide a place or someone says something or whatever so 

Recording: (9216/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9217/ 10721)

Recording: (9220/ 10721) 
yeah exactly passed through it random jobs for sure 

Recording: (9221/ 10721) 
and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute you know my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to you know get all the opportunities that were out there are for them and it just did not happen that way he wanted everything to be the same changed everything it does your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody is listening and everything you want to do somebody is 

Recording: (9222/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (9223/ 10721) 
so because he and i always discussed politics and stuff 

Recording: (9224/ 10721) 
yes exactly 

Recording: (9225/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9226/ 10721)

Recording: (9227/ 10721) 
how many times have you been in ireland

right 

Recording: (9230/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9231/ 10721) 
we start them over again they have never learned and the reason why you are throwing a carrot out too much in front of them without saying hey you got to do this to prove this to me no we have in fact one heck of a lot of ethical moral standards in this country we are losing it every day until we start looking ourselves in the mirror at night and say of myself i am proud of what i did i may not have made a dollar a day but i understood somebody today 

Recording: (9232/ 10721) 
my oldest son was in vietnam

Recording: (9238/ 10721) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (9239/ 10721) 
yeah just since march 

Recording: (9240/ 10721) 
light news that is why i tend to read alternative newspapers and stuff because you do get a different perspective it is probably just a slanted but it is different you are right 

Recording: (9241/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9242/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9243/ 10721) 
i do not know that i can answer your question straightforward because i believe in gay rights i believe in anybody is rights what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine line 

Recording: (9244/ 10721) 
crossdressing not crossdressing when two men live together and two women live together two women live together what do you call it homosexual gays oh okay is that the same thing i 

Recording: (9245/ 10721) 
yeah it got into a situation where you really were not there was a nowin situation from the getgo and i think that had we been able to do what we were able to do went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so it became a political war as everybody knows 

Recording: (9246/ 10721) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of the different students with each other i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be i mean you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different 

Recording: (9247/ 10721) 
you know i said to myself because i had postpartum depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (9248/ 10721) 
for that so he got locked up and he is not allowed to see another human being 

Recording: (9249/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9250/ 10721) 
he is finding things for his family thing i said you will i found one of them way back and what was it 1670 or something this boatload of people come over from england and they were the ones that had been deported from england because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or were the thief or something and i said would you read the only person i can find in my family is nothing but but a convict he even got deported from the country i do not know why he was there but that is the ship he was on 

Recording: (9251/ 10721)

Recording: (9252/ 10721) 
are not really saying much new but if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like to see them see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they debated to platforms and that is all settled now and it is just sort of a you know this celebration type stuff well that is not interesting it could change and move the primaries like to me 

Recording: (9253/ 10721) 
well i think the people that made that law should also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (9254/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9255/ 10721) 
okay well just call me rachel and i am 24 i have got a two year old son has just had his birthday the 31st so and i live by myself in a house and i work in the county department 

Recording: (9256/ 10721) 
right so a lot of them already believe that they have their own religion and they are really faithful so that was one of the main problems that they had been so holding on to that for so long it is so strong they do not want to let go of well and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (9257/ 10721) 
that i finally just said ok we are going to start training people to make money with computers 

Recording: (9258/ 10721) 
i just do it for the stretch it is almost like when i am laying there and kathy is saying you know take it even though i sound speedy 

Recording: (9259/ 10721) 
he always preached get a union job 

Recording: (9260/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9261/ 10721) 
three years something like that hard to remember it was a long time ago 

Recording: (9262/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (9263/ 10721) 
they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well there were not really too many other problems i mean the economy is doing really well and foreign relations are always shaky but they are getting getting a little bit better 

Recording: (9264/ 10721) 
i know the way we dressed and everything was kind of appalling to the parents and everything i guess maybe that is where i am coming from of the kids dress you know retro back to with the bell bottoms and everything to us and the piercings i just can not get into that you know and some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my guy date 14 6 15 years old 

Recording: (9265/ 10721) 
maybe at the underlying base 

Recording: (9266/ 10721) 
or they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (9267/ 10721) 
i actually joined the church in well i do not know six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at lsu and they were just asking people if they thought that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account do i think that would be important and i was like well i think so yeah i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while i read the book of mormon and i really prayed about it 

Recording: (9268/ 10721) 
pretty soon you see all the money they have been making gone 

Recording: (9269/ 10721) 
through downtown and it would take me an hour and 45 minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me 15 minutes and i would not have to to pay $50 a month for parking why not do that and there is also the whole pollution thing and those types of things so i thought that was 

Recording: (9270/ 10721) 
second and third i was working 16hour days a lot of times covering that is one of the reasons they were not going to move me 

Recording: (9271/ 10721) 
i do not intend to ever leave here so 

Recording: (9272/ 10721) 
so it was one of those 

Recording: (9273/ 10721) 
no they are not it is printed at the top on every issue that they are financially independent 

Recording: (9274/ 10721) 
i mean yes some people 

Recording: (9275/ 10721) 
i think i remember like they were like remodeling a few years back is that right 

Recording: (9276/ 10721) 
yeah that is kinda odd kinda like think of a factory like a punch card or something but um and just how uh like there is this whole thing like we can not wear hats and in the building and this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff it is just real funny to hear people speak like that and really believe it 

Recording: (9277/ 10721) 
i am going to get done with this i swear 

Recording: (9278/ 10721) 
bring what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff that does not even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is it is a struggle understanding that and i made it through all four rounds this time and i even sat up which was the first time it is a struggle but 

Recording: (9279/ 10721) 
i can not 

Recording: (9280/ 10721)

mmhmm i have had i got a couple three applications in about the kroger is and a day is worth of job for san angelo nursing home which i kind of like doing stuff for people that like that you know i worked at a custodian at st robby i was a home for the aged but i had a problem dealing with a oneonone basis with the older patients because they were just visiting you know they were not there to stay 

Recording: (9283/ 10721) 
and we were staying at his grandpa is and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and say all kinds of racial slurs towards black people 

Recording: (9284/ 10721) 
but yet that leaves a door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (9285/ 10721) 
moss bill moss he is always saying oh this is racist and that is racist but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know there are places lots worse like the south and so on of course who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (9286/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9287/ 10721) 
i do not know just exactly where the others are but they are here in the columbus area 

Recording: (9288/ 10721)

no my mom is she is not an invalid she is 72 years old but they go out usually to yard sales and stuff like that stuff i do not wanna do 

Recording: (9292/ 10721) 
yeah because of the traffic but see where i live i could get on the bus if i just wanted to go downtown real bad 

Recording: (9293/ 10721) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid is gonna hate you 

Recording: (9294/ 10721) 
yeah that is i am surprised they are not getting the lot of heat from that but because that park is been there forever 

Recording: (9295/ 10721) 
you should you should be organized i am not i have this stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting next to my bed just i am gonna go out and buy groceries and then the commons open again 

Recording: (9296/ 10721) 
country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures are different so if you want to view that as a culture or you know what i mean that that is something different except the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (9297/ 10721)

Recording: (9299/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9300/ 10721) 
or more accurately i think she took it but it is a fine line and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i have my own again i wear this one around so we have competition to see who can get the most welltraveled ring you get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country 

Recording: (9301/ 10721)

Recording: (9310/ 10721) 
scary okay and it was funny because you see the cops first but in reality the cops are behind two other people that i actually know but it does not matter because you always see cops first so the two other people that i actually know are my stepmother is parents stepmother and father have been split up for i do not know a month or two now they have been married for something like six months now and my sister and i both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she was making a horrible mistake but 

Recording: (9311/ 10721) 
well see we have real traditional breakdown of chores but only because that is just happened to be what we liked it the way we like it do you know what i mean and it is not because you know i consider my whole household a lot of feminists you know we are all real strong about that but the thing is since i have the luxury of being at home and peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and i am doing something i enjoy i really am happy to do all of those things 

Recording: (9312/ 10721)

it is like oh 

Recording: (9432/ 10721) 
it is magnified and or yeah they have that choice they can say well listen you do not understand and blah blah blah and i have tried that but but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen i hear what you are saying but i am trying to show you that and tell you how i work best so as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedom 

Recording: (9433/ 10721) 
no that is true 

Recording: (9434/ 10721) 
my answer to your question is has this eroded i am going to answer using the word respect yes i feel that this has eroded over time there is not the respect for our elders i do not necessarily mean elders in terms of the chronological age but i am talking in terms of generations 

Recording: (9435/ 10721) 
no i am a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good so i wanted to take a look at that my roommate is a business major so he was going to show me around they have new buildings i guess so he said he would show me around there also i really do like i came down for a few games and things like that and i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place so small there is a select group that has enthusiasm but nothing like here i mean this is ridiculous everyone is just enthusiastic about the university even 

Recording: (9436/ 10721) 
when the freeway was built i70 was built through town and a lot of times you do not realize what kind of havoc that creates when a freeways built through the middle of a town because you have to take out a lot of houses to do that and you can sort of realize that if you ever go around the area and go to one of the little side streets that dead ends because the freeways there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been 20 or 

Recording: (9437/ 10721) 
and it was just when drug culture was just starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you have to talk to them about things and just say you know i want to help you and i you know be there for them 100 obviously those parents were too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be to blame i do 

Recording: (9438/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9439/ 10721) 
no the lifestyle was very easy to fit into and i have always been interested in the whole european culture i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there i was in and studying english in america or in england is you know sort of i do not know more sort of elitist which i did not realize 

Recording: (9440/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9441/ 10721) 
have created a system whereby it will not be as good for those people as it has been and the ones who are genuinely unemployable but i think depending on how sort of focused they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it is divided up i do not know hopefully not special treatment but 

Recording: (9442/ 10721) 
absolutely 

Recording: (9443/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9444/ 10721)

Recording: (9449/ 10721) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is an extreme amount of violence in there you know just every one there is a bad dark side in the story so children just start and i mean it is in there and then including my own daughter she and and i swear i had her watch mr rogers all the time but now that she is older she watches tv 

Recording: (9450/ 10721)

Recording: (9451/ 10721) 
i am retired 

Recording: (9452/ 10721) 
i remember it being a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they both gave me a lot of attention about i think i was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 

Recording: (9453/ 10721) 
well somehow or other yeah and if everybody would just begin to build that way and when they start to say something nasty you would think would i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (9454/ 10721) 
and so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters 

Recording: (9455/ 10721) 
little out of the way backwards okay yeah to do the tourist thing i do not know i am not sure 

Recording: (9456/ 10721) 
oh that is good that is good 

Recording: (9457/ 10721) 
but we still need to have property management records that is very essential and a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it they do not like the detail aspect of it but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how your facilities are structured the time history any type of of 

Recording: (9458/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (9459/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9460/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (9461/ 10721) 
you know like there are two fishermen that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay in miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him he is reading about him in newsweek or someplace so i think the news media has not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (9462/ 10721) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (9463/ 10721) 
mmhmm you know even within marriage it is just like taboo yeah 

Recording: (9464/ 10721) 
i mean as far as that goes there is really nothing more he can do 

Recording: (9465/ 10721) 
yeah i was cutting 20 pounds in three days 

Recording: (9466/ 10721) 
i wish i knew the answer but reality i just feel sorry for the people that not only feel that they have to do that but also for the people that are involved in it and the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything the only one i really had to i was really upset with the columbine deal and that was because the one kid was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents knew nothing 

Recording: (9467/ 10721) 
um because he he likes he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yell but it is yeah i try to talk to him 

Recording: (9468/ 10721) 
oh no i do not feel that at all we do not hesitate to get together with other friends and take our kids places i do not remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or something you know i do not remember things like that it could have been there maybe but 

Recording: (9469/ 10721) 
in terms of government we were not ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would not go along with her you know but if we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be be great and i would very much and i then and the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life 

Recording: (9470/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9471/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9472/ 10721) 
okay how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (9473/ 10721) 
yeah a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for a very intellectual environment interesting environment but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that hehehehehehe 

Recording: (9474/ 10721) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different yeah experience with sexual harassment 

Recording: (9475/ 10721) 
oh you have to nowadays i do not understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a fulltime job that just does not happen now now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing 40 hours a week too so it is it is work and it is a fulltime job they start the sevenyearold just brought it here it is the end of the year second grade she brings home this project 

Recording: (9476/ 10721) 
i can argue both sides of that i am at a luxury i guess where we are in a position where i truly do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit in a heartbeat to take care of that but having family with him the first i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the 60 when he was 

Recording: (9477/ 10721)

Recording: (9498/ 10721) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what probably the bad things about it yeah but just coming from my christian beliefs and whatnot the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage just to be it would be nice if they teach you how to be confident in yourself and i do not mean like selfesteem but you know like we said if 

Recording: (9499/ 10721) 
i really am not educated into that at all so i would not probably say anything since i am ignorant in the field you 

Recording: (9500/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9501/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9502/ 10721) 
and it did not turn out very well so they switched it over to me for a variety of reasons which was not entirely the university is fault they had to rely on confidential information which we could not give them because it was confidential law it was confidential we could not give it to them but they needed it so it was just not a good way to do business mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다 

Recording: (9503/ 10721) 
in what way 

Recording: (9504/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9505/ 10721)

i thought maybe you would crash one of their weddings 

Recording: (9507/ 10721) 
all the cool apartments are on 161 all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (9508/ 10721) 
but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value and that will help them permeate the entire society but it is got to start back here in the first and i think 

Recording: (9509/ 10721) 
well i am saying on the whole world and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think that maybe he is found it the same way but maybe not so much as i have i thought when i retired i was going to get this done and this done and this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got some of these things done when i got home and i am sure i am doing it just as fast because over and over again people say i have never seen anybody with as much energy you are always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (9510/ 10721) 
yeah well 

Recording: (9511/ 10721) 
and do not insult us anymore or we will go to trial so my attorney jumped it back up to $125000 i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth of what they felt i was worth even the arbitrator was an asshole but that is the way that system works tomorrow 

Recording: (9512/ 10721) 
my thesis is on the sudeten germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia before the second world war and specifically i am looking at looking at how they perceived their condition switching from being part of the austrohungarian empire and the germans being sort of the the majority even though they were not the majority but sort of the master nation within the austrohungarian empire

to their own guilt and so i have got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it but another side is if we keep i believe in the reincarnation the law of cause and effect murder somebody they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made 

Recording: (9517/ 10721) 
media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (9518/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9519/ 10721) 
i mean i 

Recording: (9520/ 10721) 
which is not far from here so i did that for a while but it was not very satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at huckleberry house 

Recording: (9521/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9522/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9523/ 10721) 
yeah right i taught well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i have been in 

Recording: (9524/ 10721) 
oh yeah i was never going to get married again i had my house my kids i had already done that i was financially secure and i was not even looking one of my best friends though at the time she saw this guy he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and i talked to this girl every day and she was like oh you have to meet him you have to meet i was like oh you know call me tomorrow i do not want to meet anybody so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were she was right i mean 

Recording: (9525/ 10721) 
from the media and i say media broad based be it print media or tv that has this culture today of stars and you know media of phenomenons and and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not again i do not know what the answer is 

Recording: (9526/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9527/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9528/ 10721) 
it is only a couple people it is not the majority of people i work around are black but like i said the majority of people i work around i get along with great 

Recording: (9529/ 10721) 
been to do that 

Recording: (9530/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (9531/ 10721) 
no noise i am so used to like turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound that i have to like have music on in the room and not down here i really like the city i like the nightlife everything in ashland mansfield shuts down at 930 10 oclock and it all starts up 

Recording: (9532/ 10721) 
yeah my kids were both two weeks late so i know how that is 

Recording: (9533/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9534/ 10721) 
oh yeah herb 

Recording: (9535/ 10721) 
she is the type of person i love to annoy 

Recording: (9536/ 10721) 
yeah four girls 

Recording: (9537/ 10721) 
it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (9538/ 10721) 
oh yeah by the way 

Recording: (9539/ 10721) 
i am gonna go 

Recording: (9540/ 10721) 
that is mean that is why nobody brings it 

Recording: (9541/ 10721) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (9542/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9543/ 10721) 
i got thrown out of high school 

Recording: (9544/ 10721) 
and that sort of thing then you are leaving out a large part of the population so i am not sure it is going to give valid results anyway 

Recording: (9545/ 10721) 
i think it fills its niche i mean wexner has a niche and the museum has a niche and i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (9546/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9547/ 10721) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (9548/ 10721) 
now i go 

Recording: (9549/ 10721) 
it is about the same 

Recording: (9550/ 10721) 
no it was just the usual things she touched my things because they were far apart enough they had their own social social groups and their own friends and interests so there was not much of that but there was the usual you know she is breathing on me in the car he is humming too loud i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have probably went through it all yeah 

Recording: (9551/ 10721) 
i wonder if that is also a socialized medicine there it is socialized is not it 

Recording: (9552/ 10721) 
honest i am for it it does not have to be well i am not even sure tube stiders is pretty permanent but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them $200 a year that is still much cheaper than them having kids and then if they i would give more money if they clean up their act just for them as far as it being racist i do not think i think 

Recording: (9553/ 10721) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9554/ 10721) 
that is nice 

Recording: (9555/ 10721) 
and position where we are doing more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio and the private network the private sector is still looking at us as a showcase we are doing voice over ip internet protocol which means we are doing voice and data over the same pipe and 

Recording: (9556/ 10721) 
yeah it is she does not even drive to work 

Recording: (9557/ 10721) 
no idea 

Recording: (9558/ 10721) 
and then the powers that be in the american army decided well we will go up to to this little area ofoh i was there the next day month or four months 

Recording: (9559/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9560/ 10721) 
to say you know what i am sick of this i am going to shoot those people 

Recording: (9561/ 10721) 
i would say family values customs traditions divorce moving just looking at my sister my dallas they met here they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they are in london england 

Recording: (9562/ 10721) 
let is watch 7 to 9 

Recording: (9563/ 10721) 
i think it is too late i do 

Recording: (9564/ 10721) 
all right let us begin 

Recording: (9565/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9566/ 10721) 
i do not think i can answer that 

Recording: (9567/ 10721) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give it food and water and when it died i was so surprised that she she had not been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a fiveyearold you do not get that stuff together 

Recording: (9568/ 10721) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is a hat well you do not need a husband all you need is a sperm bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9569/ 10721) 
it was not really farming country and he went out there from iowa where you throw a corn out in the field 

Recording: (9570/ 10721) 
oh it is just so everything the environment of course is incredibly beautiful and everybody is more i think more open or more receptive to relationships and you know i think it is a much friendlier place i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live 

Recording: (9571/ 10721) 
just 

Recording: (9572/ 10721) 
it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (9573/ 10721) 
no i wanted to see her obviously but 

Recording: (9574/ 10721) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty huh 

Recording: (9575/ 10721) 
they just set up on a flatbed truck on wall street in new york and do a concert there 

Recording: (9576/ 10721) 
and she was from germany which made it a little tough because they did not talk about those things over there at all for a long time then she became very open with him but everybody knew and that was in the 80s and if some kids know it when they are young and growing up i do not know if it is best to not say it or to be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then 

Recording: (9577/ 10721) 
yeah i will be starting in 2003 

Recording: (9578/ 10721) 
that is great 

Recording: (9579/ 10721) 
basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get everything instilled at home that is pretty much what you know i seen talking to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do at all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (9580/ 10721) 
sure you do something with them but this group the middle 30s i called them you had to misogyism and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is going to be able to because to get the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am antiabortion progun he is already said the progun and that is going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans 

Recording: (9581/ 10721) 
yeah i have been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when i moved up to delaware it is a real comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9582/ 10721) 
they saw us have difficult times and they saw us our spouses crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you do you can have being in a human relationship they saw that they saw the love for one another they saw overnight where i would start caring for my dad because my mother died instantly like short term an hour and now he had a stroke i did not know whether i saved other lives and i had to learn all that and 

Recording: (9583/ 10721) 
i think my grandpa goes to church 

Recording: (9584/ 10721) 
we will see 

Recording: (9585/ 10721) 
honestly it would be i would probably base the decision basically political i can not say i would really hold that against him or anything obviously it is not something i would be like oh good let us vote for him since he did that 

Recording: (9586/ 10721) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was the majority of them saying that they were here for 10 years and they ai not making that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (9587/ 10721) 
right wow 

Recording: (9588/ 10721) 
yeah like underground now it is gotten real big like it is still different too there is still like a really big scene and there is still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (9589/ 10721) 
she graduated last year but she went home she was on home study 

Recording: (9590/ 10721) 
and it only took less than two months 

Recording: (9591/ 10721) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give a background on him and that is it is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there there 

Recording: (9592/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9593/ 10721) 
means than just giving them the number we spent more time doing that 

Recording: (9594/ 10721) 
and you have been going to ohio state that whole time 

Recording: (9595/ 10721) 
hehe 

Recording: (9596/ 10721) 
i said yep i said you caught mommy saying a bad word and you got soap in your mouth yep so i go in the bathroom now what i always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and i just pull bit of soap on the end of her tongue well now i have been i have had false teeth since i was about 32 needless to say i had false teeth when this kid did this she is only about five years old go in the bathroom i sit down on that toilet stool and i sit there i stick out my tongue she takes that cake of soap she does not rub my tongue she twists it it got on my teeth and it took 

Recording: (9597/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah there is almost nobody anymore that is willing to do just miniscule things unless you are going to be a pig money money money money money money money 

Recording: (9598/ 10721) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (9599/ 10721) 
go back and assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values i could even go so far as to say chemistry or botany or psychology any one of those those are specialized subjects and 

Recording: (9600/ 10721) 
well i was born on a homestead out in northern montana and then my parents moved back to iowa which was their home area southern iowa i grew up there attended high school there then i went to iowa state for five quarters and i just did not get it and then i worked around home for a year 

Recording: (9601/ 10721) 
that is all i understand is money 

Recording: (9602/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9603/ 10721) 
i said man why are they pulled over like that there must be something going on he said we ai not gonna worry about it right now i am gonna get back up there 3 oclock in the afternoon and i look over and there is this big old white swirling cloud comes down it is about two miles west of us i am coming just out of my i am out of my screws here i am just going 

Recording: (9604/ 10721) 
names i actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she liked so they brought her munch in to her and the nurse jokingly said or the aide or something well just pick a couple names off the menu so she named them lamangelo 

Recording: (9605/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9606/ 10721) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is not insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is not insane and just to to knock them out is not appropriate we need to try to save them not in the terms of a christian saving but to make them work that off and face it and come in their own mind 

Recording: (9607/ 10721) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people 

Recording: (9608/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9609/ 10721) 
but i do know my brotherinlaw mentioned to his parents gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned 50 and they do not have any kids and he says well how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrifice and when you sacrifice it makes you more humble 

Recording: (9610/ 10721) 
there is a lot of i do not know how the training is done with some of these animals some of them are treated very cruelly boy 

Recording: (9611/ 10721) 
we do have a mutual thing and young people there you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and all that and then i think it is kind of 

Recording: (9612/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9613/ 10721) 
i think it is better probably if they do not say anything about it you know and most of the people you know like when you get to i lived in the barracks a lot of time but i mean you know a lot of people you know they get their own places off base you know who cares what they i mean i do not care you know like i said i have a gay friend that you know i do not care what they do i mean they are old enough to do whatever the heck they want to do you know 

Recording: (9614/ 10721) 
i was married but i did not have any kids once you have kids you are not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule so i did not take off any time when i got my master is i ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need a resource teacher why do not you come up and interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked out 

Recording: (9615/ 10721) 
i am not sure if i am paying attention 

Recording: (9616/ 10721) 
the people who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from columbus 

Recording: (9617/ 10721) 
hi i am a perchable 

Recording: (9618/ 10721) 
i mean he is kind of in big trouble they are wanting to pull the charter on him and everything but he is going to try and keep the school open which is going to be ridiculous 

Recording: (9619/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9620/ 10721) 
it is an ego trip that is all it is basically it is like look i can do this 

Recording: (9621/ 10721) 
it is over off of 33 270 and 33 

Recording: (9622/ 10721) 
well and especially in my situation you know i think about it quite a bit you know if i would have had more of an opportunity to have a oneonone relationship with her i probably being a girl you know could have probably helped her out and had a lot of social social things you know about men because i kind of get the impression that she do not really she still ai not very interested in men you know so 

Recording: (9623/ 10721) 
no because like i work like i said my supervisor is a black woman now i get along good with her the other woman is an indian woman i get along real good with her the other guy is a black guy i get along real good with her but my supervisor is got a friend that is a black woman that works in another department now she will come and talk to her and dump all her work on to us 

Recording: (9624/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9625/ 10721) 
so i hesitate to say that it would really help them it would just be better if somebody could keep their eyes open or if we had more counselors or things like that like that to deal with everything including that 

Recording: (9626/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9627/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9628/ 10721) 
it was for me and a couple other people that was it 

Recording: (9629/ 10721) 
they do not have any like endangered they are not like on an endangered species list where you can not like 

Recording: (9630/ 10721) 
well among the people i know i think it is a pretty tolerant city i know a lot of people who live down in old town you know in a very diverse environment and you know i just do not know any racists i do not think 

Recording: (9631/ 10721) 
she goes well yeah dad they cost money i said oh lord 

Recording: (9632/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9633/ 10721) 
you know he had 

Recording: (9634/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9635/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (9636/ 10721) 
if there were any germans in there i will bet they are scared 

Recording: (9637/ 10721) 
and you know like reading about things that happened to people like their kids spitting up in their face or something 

Recording: (9638/ 10721) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (9639/ 10721) 
well my family is so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together now you know back then you know my you saw my mom no you did not see her she is cute she is got a little haircut she is all like

you 

Recording: (9642/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9643/ 10721) 
i think they are missing the point because i am sure there is some runaway white teenage girls out there too or mexican or whatnot 

Recording: (9644/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9645/ 10721) 
and also at the show of hands galleries 

Recording: (9646/ 10721)

Recording: (9647/ 10721) 
no i really just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (9648/ 10721) 
so when he was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i got to get it together what am i going to do so he agreed to go to a psychiatrist and so he went on ritalin so he took the ritalin through his last of his junior year and his senior year now he is on a medication they call welbutrin 

Recording: (9649/ 10721) 
other person is wrong and leave it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right dude why do you think there is so much of that nonacceptance in christianity and other religions as well there are certain denominations that will take one it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to 

Recording: (9650/ 10721) 
as far as affiliated with a party i probably respond to republicans more than democrats but i think given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (9651/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9652/ 10721) 
exactly right yeah yeah and you know a lot of people i work with do not see that and you know they think i am a real cheapskate you know because you know i will i spend money you know it well i i am very selective i mean like i would love to go to disney world and there are people at work that would not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in you know now i drive there i do not fly because i am really that cheap but i would love to fly but i just go oh my gosh i will do that but at thanksgiving time we do not buy a butter ball turkey 

Recording: (9653/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9654/ 10721) 
i ended up running away from home 

Recording: (9655/ 10721) 
medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids dead and face them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well and since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite and some kids get headaches from dexedrine and adderall so i say you know if it works use it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because 

Recording: (9656/ 10721) 
i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know than i would have at a bigger school 

Recording: (9657/ 10721) 
i am sorry 

Recording: (9658/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9659/ 10721) 
because i become unpopular if i have like any time away from my girlfriend 

Recording: (9660/ 10721) 
warriors that are out there men and women that will do that more power to them all i can do is pray about it and that is what i suggest to everybody else that is the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the nuns in high school that taught me had a poster on the wall that said more things are wrought in this world by prayer than we will ever know 

Recording: (9661/ 10721) 
this little kid who still has a living parent and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line 

Recording: (9662/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9663/ 10721) 
i know i am i can not wait because the house we live in it is a half double when we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but you know i have like 80 plants in my house now but i just can not wait to have my own space i never plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i am going to leave you know 

Recording: (9664/ 10721) 
now we run an online system where people connect to our system and build databases or access the databases everything osu has in their library collection is in our system their records came from us yeah well yeah and we do that for tens of thousands of libraries 

Recording: (9665/ 10721) 
being here at the university 

Recording: (9666/ 10721) 
but not all of them are that way 

Recording: (9667/ 10721) 
i think it should be my way and i think the material should be there i think it should be dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids you 

Recording: (9668/ 10721) 
just a job that is an awesome job 

Recording: (9669/ 10721) 
see he is just in his twos and i like he is gotta be in a cart or something well cuz when i am holding his hand and taking him he just tends to want to he is not calm and collective he is a little you know so that is why we do not do nothing because when i take them to people is houses i can not do that because they will get into everything i get real stressed out about that 

Recording: (9670/ 10721) 
yes private homes and actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (9671/ 10721) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (9672/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9673/ 10721) 
i would say probably the black man 

Recording: (9674/ 10721) 
i have been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women sometimes i felt kind of weird about it 

Recording: (9675/ 10721) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (9676/ 10721) 
yeah that is it 

Recording: (9677/ 10721) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (9678/ 10721) 
right and also the other thing is you have to be compassionate because you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you spit something out you want an answer each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign if i tell somebody turn left heading 360 he is supposed to respond twa 396 roger if he does not respond then i have got to say it again which means instead of 10 airplanes i now have 11 i am talking to because i have to talk to him two times each so there are some people that get really 

Recording: (9679/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (9680/ 10721) 
no i mean it is nothing crazy whatever they think they are gotten 

Recording: (9681/ 10721) 
if that happened i would be 10 times more understanding and i would say you know i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes 

Recording: (9682/ 10721) 
they do not do it today unless the person is a scholar i mean a 38 rhodes scholar hey okay 

Recording: (9683/ 10721) 
i am 

Recording: (9684/ 10721) 
heh heh heh heh heh 

Recording: (9685/ 10721) 
yes but you know what his parents are going to you know really going to let people know that 

Recording: (9686/ 10721) 
and then they physically died before they got a chance to live and when their spirit wakes up and finds out that they are physically dead and they can not do anything in a physical world anymore they want to draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person they want to draw them to brightest thing 

Recording: (9687/ 10721) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot 

Recording: (9688/ 10721) 
yeah i do not really have any childhood recollections of california yeah 

Recording: (9689/ 10721) 
mmm well that bathroom is starting to sound good right about now 

Recording: (9690/ 10721) 
got to help here to make the home and i think that that is one of the problems too many people think instead of just getting them to lovingly help each other because we are supposed to help each other and this goes all right back to what i said you said beginning in school or kindergarten i think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a box and rock it and sing to it put it to bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up teach him how to tie their shoes and take them off teach him how to do everything there is 

Recording: (9691/ 10721) 
so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question from over the time that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect i have always been the kind of person to leave i never told my kids not to do something i ca not do it this age somebody can at another age possibly like go out on a date for example well he is going out to a party like i have well he is already 16 years old but i mean i never did well i will not give you any examples but anyway if i told them they could not do it i would try them swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that i would try to i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my own little girl if they did catch me doing something that i would be telling them no you cannot do i would apologize and say mommy was bad and mommy did that i got sick of my mouth one time because of it well that is really admirable oh no i mean if you want to hear the story it is funny well the tv just i was baking pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie i said i like to sit there for a minute before i take it out i take it on out and sit on top of it well mommy said a bad word i guess that mommy has to have soap in her mouth does not she i get to put soap in your mouth i said yep i said yep you caught mommy saying a bad word 

Recording: (9692/ 10721) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you got a boy and a girl 

Recording: (9693/ 10721) 
before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know i definitely got a feeling and there were a few classes that really stood out were you know there was sort of you know i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like what does this american can know and that was the hardest thing the way i was treated by some of my peers in classes 

Recording: (9694/ 10721) 
even republicans were like that 

Recording: (9695/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9696/ 10721) 
it is been completely outrageous storylines and the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (9697/ 10721) 
just get me a couple shirts or something you know she always bought my clothes anyway so just get me a couple get me whatever you think i need you know i will be here drinking beer watching sports and the courts 

Recording: (9698/ 10721) 
back there block so it is right near a lot of other student housing 

Recording: (9699/ 10721) 
i was also robbed about three times delivering pizzas for domino is in the campus area a couple of times we are down a little bit south of campus 4th street and 5th avenue near there 4th street and 7th once was right on practically on campus 16th avenue near high street i was robbed there once yeah near 

Recording: (9700/ 10721) 
and i tell people at the va clinic and everything they got a homeless thing over there and i said you know this guy brenda i know he is a vietnam vet you guys need to get out there and help him you know i mean you are in more of a situation than i am to be able to go out and sit there and he wants to be taken like mary haven or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out 

Recording: (9701/ 10721) 
that goes a lot longer than just giving them that because if they give it they do not do with it so i really think as i always say traveling people are all the same worldwide they just give them different colors different facial different accents so god can give them unique characteristics so he can call them his own he knows each one of us but we are all the same when we sit down 

Recording: (9702/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9703/ 10721) 
and they fought a lot there was a lot of violence and then i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i swear i have not seen a walt disney movie that does not have violence in it 

Recording: (9704/ 10721) 
they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one dose and they were giving him three doses 

Recording: (9705/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9706/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9707/ 10721) 
i see no 

Recording: (9708/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9709/ 10721) 
the drivers are not so insane like they are here people are a little bit more laid back just because like i do not know in parts it is really insane but sometimes people just like because it is all because it is nice weather people do not get so like aggravated by like here it is like cold and gray and you just want to like yell at people in their car and stuff or something i do not know i do not know what people is deal is 

Recording: (9710/ 10721) 
ah wow 

Recording: (9711/ 10721) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (9712/ 10721) 
oh sure 

Recording: (9713/ 10721) 
well i believe it is quality not quantity ideally one parent would be there be it male or female you know man or wife everywhere but your quality time is more important if you come home and you are not all you want to do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever you know and not spend any time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are there for two hours 

Recording: (9714/ 10721) 
over to dayton and we are calling from zanesville office i would rather make a long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going or dayton we can make the call as if if it is a local call avoiding all long distance 

Recording: (9715/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9716/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (9717/ 10721) 
i was trying to avoid that question rewind no but i thought you know just get a little insight on what is going on out there in delaware and maybe possibly find someone to be with 

Recording: (9718/ 10721) 
should not you have a little more knowledge a little more support around you educating knowing selfdiscipline and what is really crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children do not know the dads 

Recording: (9719/ 10721) 
we are having like three concerts next month 

Recording: (9720/ 10721) 
i do not remember exactly probably so 

Recording: (9721/ 10721) 
it was neat because my mom was 29 and pete was 18 pete was just like some kid who liked to play we would go and fly kites and do all all this fun stuff and 

Recording: (9722/ 10721) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (9723/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (9724/ 10721) 
and they never were i mean the same with like in france especially mcdonald is well mcdonald is is full of all the french people you know i mean 

Recording: (9725/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (9726/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9727/ 10721) 
well yeah when he was i do not remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been colic or whatever but he just cried and yeah 

Recording: (9728/ 10721) 
most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved with their kids than say our parents were as kids 

Recording: (9729/ 10721) 
there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with it children 

Recording: (9730/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9731/ 10721) 
they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools even when going to ohio state compared to miami university all different i see a difference in the standards of the students but i believe and i have seen it with my son going to ohio state that his moral that he is gained through his precollege years are staying with him and i am very grateful that there is 

Recording: (9732/ 10721) 
exactly 

Recording: (9733/ 10721) 
wow i did not realize that 

Recording: (9734/ 10721) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but with aids and as rampant as it is now and there is so many more women that have it start off it was mostly men women have got to know at an early age about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (9735/ 10721) 
you have spelled every name you have read every name you have written every name practically there are not any that you have not heard of 

Recording: (9736/ 10721) 
she is doing alright as far as i know she is going to st louis university do not ask me why 

Recording: (9737/ 10721) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (9738/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9739/ 10721) 
but in the winters when you know i mean i do not exercise that much 

Recording: (9740/ 10721) 
so you know i just think the more you are open about things i just think that is the best why you know when you put things and do not talk about it that is that is when the problems start 

Recording: (9741/ 10721) 
what would you go with 

Recording: (9742/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9743/ 10721) 
again they set different rules 

Recording: (9744/ 10721) 
so they thought well gee you know free land to a farmer so they went out there but ted said in the 11 years that they were out there they only raised three or four crops 

Recording: (9745/ 10721) 
um no english 

Recording: (9746/ 10721) 
which is great 

Recording: (9747/ 10721) 
kind of dwindling 

Recording: (9748/ 10721) 
well i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (9749/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9750/ 10721)

Recording: (9755/ 10721) 
in like a three hour block of time

Recording: (9760/ 10721) 
i do not want to let you go syndrome 

Recording: (9761/ 10721) 
dwin credu bod hynnyn ddiddorol 

Recording: (9762/ 10721) 
right now he is really interested in eastern religions i am not sure where that came from you know when they go to college and they are gone and you do not see them much that is what he is interested in right now so i do not think it really took 

Recording: (9763/ 10721) 
i have got plenty of people it is funny jason is mom asked me so is your mom gonna come and stay with you for a week i said no i told my mom she started last because i mean of course for her to come over and help out is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we would just kill each other 

Recording: (9764/ 10721) 
because i did not start dating until i was almost 17 but almost everybody else had even i am going to be 36 here in a week or two so we are talking i graduated in 82 where now i think kids are dating at like 10 11 12 

Recording: (9765/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9766/ 10721) 
oh and the city 

Recording: (9767/ 10721) 
actually he in the 50s he had a jazz club and it was real popular it had food and live music peggy lee sang there and some kind of name people i was not around but and also he had a private club that was similar to the bunny club it was the key club where people had to pay a membership and it was in a real nice area downtown here and he is also owned 

Recording: (9768/ 10721) 
are they friendlier than the koalas 

Recording: (9769/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9770/ 10721) 
very very much so now 50 years ago 25 to 50 years ago we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that that as socialism well in the manner we defined socialism 50 years ago we are a very very socialistic government today were no longer a democratic government as defined back there then yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition it is 

Recording: (9771/ 10721) 
i started to get it out i spilled it and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here here is two little shoes of 

Recording: (9772/ 10721) 
but i 

Recording: (9773/ 10721) 
well you know because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure that i did not pay more than $3000 on it cost me more than $3000 and so if i had $5000 or $6000 out of it i was happy 

Recording: (9774/ 10721) 
with people start realizing hey we are chasing our tails then that couple got wise and said hey we are going to do it with less and we are going go for quality when that couple reaches that mentality mr loan officer you are going to have a greater society to work with 

Recording: (9775/ 10721) 
whether they are playing a video game where they are shooting people i can not see that as being something that affects them 

Recording: (9776/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9777/ 10721) 
it is in education it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate education business schools coming up like they are building a new building i will be gone by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it will be so as far as education like for a small school and they just opened up their phd program program in education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science and it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my views 

Recording: (9778/ 10721) 
christians 

Recording: (9779/ 10721) 
made you well aware of 

Recording: (9780/ 10721) 
i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say this is not working we both deserve to be happy and go your own separate ways 

Recording: (9781/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9782/ 10721) 
yes um-hum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there to do those things there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when people are like oh columbus there is nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (9783/ 10721) 
brugge 

Recording: (9784/ 10721) 
not really i was too proud i think my dad paid my first month is rent for me though i paid him back and then i never i never wanted to borrow any money i guess just growing up the youngest of five i appreciated money 

Recording: (9785/ 10721) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids and but it will not be him running it 

Recording: (9786/ 10721) 
you know compared to any other cities of course i am i left oregon i was very rural for 18 years 

Recording: (9787/ 10721) 
they are all at daycare they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter who is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the daycare cares 

Recording: (9788/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9789/ 10721) 
i mean we went in there one day and i explained the whole thing to her and then she puts off some kind of excuse to the administrator she says well we do not need problem students like yourself blah blah blah i said what problem 

Recording: (9790/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9791/ 10721) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else this suits me fine 

Recording: (9792/ 10721) 
i mean they went to the polls in droves you did not have to you know the hope there was that they would not go to vote on the school levy but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (9793/ 10721) 
mmhmm because i want his morals and you know his basic stuff to come from me really 

Recording: (9794/ 10721) 
mmhmm yeah yeah i would say anything outside i like doing that 

Recording: (9795/ 10721) 
you had a harvest did not you 

Recording: (9796/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9797/ 10721) 
he will basically tell you he do not have no father except for me 

Recording: (9798/ 10721) 
i do it so 

Recording: (9799/ 10721) 
yeah avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do better decisions that help 

Recording: (9800/ 10721) 
well that depends i think i like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites in the symphony unfortunately they tend to have budget problems because a lot of the people in that group are paid i get paid kind of a semiprofessional aspect 

Recording: (9801/ 10721) 
and partying sound pretty good so 

Recording: (9802/ 10721) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at 11 oclock in the morning and 4 oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i used to do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of 

Recording: (9803/ 10721) 
um yeah i mean i have got girls that are that have girlfriends and stuff and it does not bother me i mean i am not i like men and i am a christian and i just believe that you know you should be god did not put two women on this earth god did not put two men they put a man and a woman to be together to have kids 

Recording: (9804/ 10721) 
he is in his sophomore year 

Recording: (9805/ 10721)

Recording: (9807/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9808/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9809/ 10721) 
yeah it is gone downhill a lot 

Recording: (9810/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9811/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9812/ 10721) 
and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9813/ 10721) 
ah probably 

Recording: (9814/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9815/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9816/ 10721)

Recording: (9817/ 10721) 
disregistered barbarism to me 

Recording: (9818/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9819/ 10721) 
i talk to all my family my brothers and sisters every day 

Recording: (9820/ 10721) 
mwahaha 

Recording: (9821/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9822/ 10721) 
some really wacky stuff 

Recording: (9823/ 10721) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (9824/ 10721) 
but the dispatch the only reason i get the dispatch is i do want to know what is going on locally 

Recording: (9825/ 10721) 
answered an ad in the paper but i have sung in well sean sings in the symphony chorus too i have sung in it for 16 years 

Recording: (9826/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9827/ 10721) 
too much 

Recording: (9828/ 10721) 
like 

Recording: (9829/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9830/ 10721) 
my older sister is a different case she is a little badder but as long as you have a good parent i think that is really all that matters was my mother and father she did very well 

Recording: (9831/ 10721) 
i do not know how to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what street it is on 

Recording: (9832/ 10721) 
yeah i would do that 

Recording: (9833/ 10721) 
yeah yeah it might be 

Recording: (9834/ 10721) 
你呀 

Recording: (9835/ 10721) 
that was kinda neat though 

Recording: (9836/ 10721) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i she is still that she is lives with a man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (9837/ 10721) 
i think that the 

Recording: (9838/ 10721) 
the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just bomb somewhere but i see a lot of a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things you kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here it would be interesting oh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that you know if they are caught 

Recording: (9839/ 10721) 
so i am sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for 

Recording: (9840/ 10721) 
it is amazing and that is something i know my husband we always joke about he tells his guys at work you know like you know to take flowers for no reason you know like like one guy was saying something about his anniversary and peter said well are you going to take flowers and he goes oh i do not know and he said trust me take some flowers 

Recording: (9841/ 10721) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is really he nurtures him too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (9842/ 10721) 
now we are busy 

Recording: (9843/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9844/ 10721) 
and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (9845/ 10721) 
no commitment if these guys have commitment and you see guys out there they want to go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe fulfill something whatever it is you ask each individual what it is that drives you and that is the thing i get so perturbed by interviewers they ask somebody and and somebody comes back and says you know what i mean yeah get inside the guy is mind what did he mean 

Recording: (9846/ 10721) 
well they are supposed to do more too but by the time they get to fourth grade they are so busy trying to be the class clown they decide it is a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to fill your mind with knowledge you 

Recording: (9847/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9848/ 10721) 
she just used the word penalty penalty has lots of different definitions each individual has a mental picture of what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences i want to take just and say penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left let is come back to about the middle i am going 

Recording: (9849/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9850/ 10721) 
okay i 

Recording: (9851/ 10721) 
i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is very the whole very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this like you said me me me and i got to have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we older people people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself 

Recording: (9852/ 10721) 
it is in northern ohio it is near illyria which is west of cleveland 

Recording: (9853/ 10721) 
i hear some of that from gor but not as much 

Recording: (9854/ 10721) 
understood what i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that is what i believe my faith is my faith is faith it is believing that things happen that you can not explain it is believing that you are doing what you are doing is right religion is a real big part of my life 

Recording: (9855/ 10721) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (9856/ 10721) 
it is a clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 

Recording: (9857/ 10721) 
i think so i think so it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off i do not mean it by any stretch that it is a tragedy to have a baby but somebody in high school is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (9858/ 10721) 
definite ideas about it partner everything 

Recording: (9859/ 10721) 
you are here for a reason and you are here in the united states for a reason of all the beatitudes you have here do not you think it is time to share some of those the things the talent and to not necessarily be recognized for those things but some personalities require personalities it is the way it is to do things without expecting something in return that would be so nice to see that written on magazine fronts 

Recording: (9860/ 10721) 
you know because when you are overseas it is a different environment 

Recording: (9861/ 10721) 
oh i take the little ladies i take the church 

Recording: (9862/ 10721) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at 17 or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal teen and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost at much younger than 17 you know ugh okay 11 12 it is like 

Recording: (9863/ 10721) 
there is so many millions of guns in the world that you are wondering where are they all coming from i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that not just a safety lock but you know it is like identification thing 

Recording: (9864/ 10721) 
my mother is go in get what you want get the heck out 

Recording: (9865/ 10721) 
no i thought my son 

Recording: (9866/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9867/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9868/ 10721) 
i should have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for money or previously done work for money or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money i am in favor of that put a good system by which to do things i sell it to you you go do those things i sit around and make money off of your efforts yay that so 

Recording: (9869/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9870/ 10721) 
you can see it here you can see some nineteen year old or eighteen year old guy or girl or whatever you know and see the difference in the maturity you know of another couple or three different people and everything i do not know whether me coming from like a rural area you know i asked and everything i think it maybe has something to do with that even to today you know you are more of 

Recording: (9871/ 10721) 
uh huh 

Recording: (9872/ 10721) 
in my own civilian terms i said why would you want to give up an original why would you want to give up an original and have a copy because all these others one to be well in other words you follow christianity 

Recording: (9873/ 10721) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (9874/ 10721) 
the same thing i think they are terrific for the right things 

Recording: (9875/ 10721) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and that he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be catholic great if he does not that is okay 

Recording: (9876/ 10721) 
as much probably 

Recording: (9877/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (9878/ 10721) 
and then but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heartwrenching 

Recording: (9879/ 10721) 
et 

Recording: (9880/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9881/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (9882/ 10721) 
the second thing would be the cultural activities that we have wexner center would be one of my primary ones because there is so much going on down there but the art museum and oh right that cultural arts center and columbus music hall i mean there is just a million things 

Recording: (9883/ 10721) 
so to me the thing that hurt me the most out of it is they want to put caps on our salaries so i am at the high end scale i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to unless i move into supervision or something up in the and i will be out of the the union if i do that anyway but they are going to put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now 

Recording: (9884/ 10721) 
it is good money yeah one idea that i just had recently is medical informaticist which is a person who has an md and does computers since those are my two main interests i thought doing both would be really cool 

Recording: (9885/ 10721) 
ha ha 

Recording: (9886/ 10721) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (9887/ 10721) 
but you are working now janet 

Recording: (9888/ 10721) 
whatever you are gonna get away with 

Recording: (9889/ 10721) 
like the continent 

Recording: (9890/ 10721) 
really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (9891/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (9892/ 10721) 
college without the tuition 

Recording: (9893/ 10721) 
and then after so long a time after i do not know how long again the powers that be said we will fool them we will fog up that whole area with smoke 

Recording: (9894/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9895/ 10721) 
they definitely struggle i think to be that high up obviously you are going to come in contact with powerful people rich people and things like that i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the republicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (9896/ 10721) 
misses and hits my window tough luck bob 

Recording: (9897/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9898/ 10721) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (9899/ 10721) 
stuff and every day there was a new twist on this story that or they announced the news was that there was not a news twist yeah i do not care but you could not turn it off because that is all that was on 

Recording: (9900/ 10721) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how he is he is learned i would say he knows more than most kindergartners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we will 

Recording: (9901/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (9902/ 10721) 
and at least it gave you a lot of different views 

Recording: (9903/ 10721) 
you know and it is just i think that that happens so often there is so many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you are talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (9904/ 10721) 
being turned away 

Recording: (9905/ 10721) 
i am not real big on the denominations because i think that sort of goes against what the original intent of christianity was i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and the denominations are just i do not like them 

Recording: (9906/ 10721) 
yeah but my oldest she is the oldest she is got three kids her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because she never sees them them and then they got two other girls and they live together got a house you know they are on they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got a older 

Recording: (9907/ 10721) 
at this point i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would merge move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it and if they do not pull their scores up they will you know 

Recording: (9908/ 10721) 
yeah and she is adorable 

Recording: (9909/ 10721) 
at you can see its face you can see what it looks like and everything but i said i do not want to know the sex and it is so hard to because we are looking of course we are going through this tape trying to see if we can see anything can not tell i think she was real careful to make sure that we would not be able to she says i know what it is but i said alright do not tell us so that 

Recording: (9910/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (9911/ 10721) 
they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this thick and it was only about painting 

Recording: (9912/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9913/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (9914/ 10721) 
i do that every once in a while just like when i get bored 

Recording: (9915/ 10721) 
and they actually offered an early retirement because the funds you may not remember about three years ago four years ago the federal government was not going to pass a budget so when that does not happen on budget and cuts in at 75 of what the previous year budget was or something like that which was actually more money than they were going to give us before the head it so they had to lay off people or offer retirement so i took the retirement because 

Recording: (9916/ 10721) 
or then they had to after that they had to lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what should be worse knowing that you are going to get a notice and being able to to prepare for it or because i have had friends that got numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god 

Recording: (9917/ 10721) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (9918/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9919/ 10721) 
uh i do not i mean they are definitely is that image of you know dallas and i see i think it is it is worse i think the image of the tourists basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked the 

Recording: (9920/ 10721) 
i do not really remember october if that 

Recording: (9921/ 10721) 
kind of yeah actually with this case i do know what happened to the father he ended up moving to colorado 

Recording: (9922/ 10721) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (9923/ 10721) 
well one thing you know being i came from basically a poor neighborhood poor lifestyle early life and everything you know so if anything i guess it kind of made me negative towards people that had influence and had money and did not do anything good with that i am a firm believer that if you have got something that you should share it with other people i do not always practice what i preach but that would be a great way to do it 

Recording: (9924/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9925/ 10721) 
i am 

Recording: (9926/ 10721) 
in a strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (9927/ 10721) 
pretty well 

Recording: (9928/ 10721) 
especially when we try to sleep at five in the morning 

Recording: (9929/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9930/ 10721) 
and they would ask you know can i do this can i use this kids now if i take my phone off and lay it on my desk kids will walk right up and just take it they will not ask me they will just go oh and then they start playing pushing button is this your phone if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you would not like it much would you 

Recording: (9931/ 10721) 
you can not explain that and those have been questions i have been asked by our children well how did your mom die well gee how do you know well hey that is one of the risks in life marriage but the thing is do you want to make it work 

Recording: (9932/ 10721) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (9933/ 10721) 
i was born in new york 

Recording: (9934/ 10721) 
i do not have to put up with anyone is crap but long drive and long distances is not good for me focusing concentrating i have had several accidents several tickets i have even had to other head injuries 

Recording: (9935/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9936/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah and i always use it as a decoration on the bed but i think that that is a lot of the main problem really 

Recording: (9937/ 10721) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future going all the way back finances were not a consideration in the oh i would say probably my first 30 maybe 40 years there was some influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (9938/ 10721) 
and then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9939/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9940/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9941/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9942/ 10721) 
and she said well mary just as well go out and get a job she does not need to sit around here 

Recording: (9943/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9944/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (9945/ 10721) 
mmhmm mmhmm 

Recording: (9946/ 10721) 
i can not see a lot of substance he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then turn it back it is not anything really firm i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was the points they wanted to make and i do not hear that coming from bush 

Recording: (9947/ 10721) 
i have lived in columbus my entire life 34 years born and raised on the west side of columbus 

Recording: (9948/ 10721) 
i mean i do not know like i have never gotten the kind of dance clothes you are describing i mean they were not around 

Recording: (9949/ 10721) 
he was lucky 

Recording: (9950/ 10721) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a level if you are exchanging hours for money or time for money then you have a finite amount of time and that sucks 

Recording: (9951/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9952/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9953/ 10721) 
uh huh 

Recording: (9954/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (9955/ 10721) 
i do because they were not in their children is lives enough they were not talking about things being open about things at dinner finding out about school you can not blame them for having a site on the internet not too many parents would know that that their kids you know but no i think that is a good thing i put the blame on the parents 

Recording: (9956/ 10721) 
and i guess he is still going to build it 

Recording: (9957/ 10721) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (9958/ 10721) 
that is yeah it is developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some expert thought thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance does not take over until about age eight 

Recording: (9959/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (9960/ 10721) 
not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was living there 10 years before she married and got involved in a youth group i think that was very influential on her decision she was not married in the church all my other children were she is going her own path and that is fine with me she is a very good girl she is very conscientious 

Recording: (9961/ 10721) 
see now 

Recording: (9962/ 10721) 
it is just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they are going to be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (9963/ 10721) 
it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did 

Recording: (9964/ 10721) 
yeah that is really a tough one because i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily i do not know it is a tough one i mean your daughter his 

Recording: (9965/ 10721) 
oh the japanese come too 

Recording: (9966/ 10721) 
why would you want to leave you said you were in third world country why would you want to leave a third world country i have been i would not want to this country has a lot of problems it is just like my family has a lot of problems why would i want to leave a family family why would i leave the country why not work with it and correct it because when i run away from it you know what i am doing i am running into another chaos at the other end someone else is coming in the other direction and they have not resolved things and that is been happening in our society we have not sat down to learn and understand one another other churches i am thinking of an example united church of christ some parishes or mbc 뉴스 김수진입니다 

Recording: (9967/ 10721) 
we sat there then foroh it was kind of funny the lieutenant who was a forward observer were going out to a forward observation post lieutenant whatever his title was was guiding he was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him and of course we just had these little 

Recording: (9968/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (9969/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (9970/ 10721) 
like um just the suburbs develop and how it is more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that is really big like columbus downtown is really ought to everything there is nothing to do down there it is all businesses and like the couple shops in a down there close at like six and there is like 

Recording: (9971/ 10721) 
yeah now 

Recording: (9972/ 10721) 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took him a while to catch on to things 

Recording: (9973/ 10721) 
oh sure you can not get a grip really just feel it is like just tell you how to write it okay well at least you are honest about it you know but i went to like i went out to the area of dijon 

Recording: (9974/ 10721) 
yeah there is you know our shop only has about five people out of 20 maybe that have been here over 10 years probably a lot of turnover a lot of people go on to management positions or leave but once you have got 20 years in it is like you can not leave now 

Recording: (9975/ 10721) 
there is lots of theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants 

Recording: (9976/ 10721) 
me out 

Recording: (9977/ 10721) 
very new age 

Recording: (9978/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9979/ 10721) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (9980/ 10721) 
i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say you know we want to give you this option we prefer you do not do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 

Recording: (9981/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9982/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (9983/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9984/ 10721) 
i do not know 

Recording: (9985/ 10721) 
i do i will tell you i have seen every name after 28 years of 

Recording: (9986/ 10721) 
yeah i was only 19 well i was 18 when i went in but 

Recording: (9987/ 10721) 
ha ha 

Recording: (9988/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9989/ 10721) 
the columbus race showed that he crossed gender lines he crossed party lines he crossed over into all of the city winning even dorothy teeter is precinct which surprised me and not by just a little small margin i think it was 200 and some votes which is pretty substantial

which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are going to keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money and travel you see what i mean you change your opinions change as you get older and you begin to look back i do not think i was ever a spin thrift to the point that i did things foolishly some things i did do foolish but on an overall basis 

Recording: (10022/ 10721) 
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too 

Recording: (10023/ 10721) 
alright 

Recording: (10024/ 10721) 
and civil 

Recording: (10025/ 10721) 
to help him 

Recording: (10026/ 10721) 
i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then she can take the boy over to the daycare and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (10027/ 10721) 
she is always trying to recruit people to come and visit her but it is like a two hour drive and then everybody is busy that is four hours of driving i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way 

Recording: (10028/ 10721) 
i was at eugene and i was not even in eugene it was a hundred thousand you know and i loved that but then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on the river and it is very very scenic very beautiful 

Recording: (10029/ 10721) 
that whole thing 

Recording: (10030/ 10721) 
south pacific 

Recording: (10031/ 10721) 
nothing is coming to mind now 

Recording: (10032/ 10721) 
i was the only straight person in there walk in there she would come right to me no offense 

Recording: (10033/ 10721) 
there is a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they are miserable 

Recording: (10034/ 10721) 
yeah it is a you can if you are if you can not go to a girl is dorm until i think maybe the afternoon i think maybe 11 i am not sure but you have to be out by a certain time it is not as bad as like malone like i do not know if you have heard about malone they have like certain days so it is not like that but it is still just a pain and 

Recording: (10035/ 10721) 
we have a yeah we have 

Recording: (10036/ 10721) 
you are right 

Recording: (10037/ 10721) 
so like there is not a lot you can really do with that 

Recording: (10038/ 10721) 
i think the latter i do not think will make any difference the kids that i know in junior high and in college it just does not make any difference to them and they do not like those classes they think they are boring they think it has no relevance to their life 

Recording: (10039/ 10721) 
exactly i wish i would have taken typing in home ec in high school and i was too busy with college prep and you know what good did that do me yeah yeah there is just 

Recording: (10040/ 10721) 
i am going out there like this in a freaking retards i swear but there is kids out there always cutting 

Recording: (10041/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (10042/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10043/ 10721) 
and putting together a network itself and we had you think of a party line system or they used to call it daisy chain in the industry you had to wait and wait for your turn to get onto a data network and we got down to the point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had a dedicated pipe you 

Recording: (10044/ 10721) 
mmhmm mmhmm 

Recording: (10045/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (10046/ 10721) 
and so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of enzio was just flat as this rock stable almost for an area back from the mediterranean back probably ten miles ten or twelve miles well along the coast along and so we had enough area to many people 

Recording: (10047/ 10721) 
know because i am sure there are gay boys that are not knowing what is going on with themselves that are in school and and i have never really understood i never really understood if they were born like that or i just never really understood that to tell you the truth i would not you know i would just if i was a teacher i would just talk to them and you know tell them to do whatever they want 

Recording: (10048/ 10721) 
columbus um-hum i went to i ended up in an alternative school system all along i was i got into the lottery they used i i made it into every school i applied for 

Recording: (10049/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10050/ 10721) 
no she still lives down here my other sister has two niece and my nephew 

Recording: (10051/ 10721) 
so that was fun yeah 

Recording: (10052/ 10721) 
it is not the exact same as say class was in the marxist sense but class lines still today very much follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not not going to be able to get a job that is going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in real terms in things i think are 

Recording: (10053/ 10721) 
difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (10054/ 10721) 
you had it 

Recording: (10055/ 10721) 
high school marijuana acid mushrooms 

Recording: (10056/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (10057/ 10721) 
i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your landlady and then it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was going to move that when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but the bottom line is i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so it is like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment 

Recording: (10058/ 10721) 
the area i live in now is the westgate area we grew up on the hilltop area but i now live in the westgate which is a little further west 

Recording: (10059/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (10060/ 10721) 
stuff at christmas but it is not so much you know and and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there there is not that at at all at least in my experience there and i can not imagine because western europe i think is sort of as much like america as you can get probably you know most places elsewhere in the world and i mean that would have been a fantastic experience you 

Recording: (10061/ 10721) 
it is not going to work 

Recording: (10062/ 10721) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the screen for us to watch i mean i learned a lot of stuff a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (10063/ 10721) 
マスク 

Recording: (10064/ 10721) 
i am sorry i can not 

Recording: (10065/ 10721) 
because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (10066/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (10067/ 10721) 
it is unifying and i just wish but i guess there is a rule out there i have asked abc news why they can not promote the these you know they show the roster here is your grade point average engineering major fine tell them what the majors are tell them what these kids are what they plan on doing they are not all going to make it to the professionals then what do they do afterwards they get token jobs because of their connections 

Recording: (10068/ 10721) 
but they would not because my daughter was like a real bubbly outgoing people person and she got by with so much at school but she is you know it is worked out fine with her with both of them actually 

Recording: (10069/ 10721) 
because they feel they have the need for it there is so many golfers i mean sports went sky high my mom used to play golf growing up and they only let the on the golf courses one day a week which is amazing it was like on a tuesday and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought they are only allowing women one day a week you know is not that amazing there is so many good women golfers now but they said they are too slow and they always talk and that just killed me when my mom that is the only day she is ever been in a wheelchair 

Recording: (10070/ 10721) 
actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the adhd and some have adhd without the learning disability and some have both you can have add without having the hyperactive part you can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hypoactive activity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of like out of touch with reality and they are 

Recording: (10071/ 10721) 
now i am like depressed because like man i guess i got a few months here and now i want to just go you know it is like when you get psyched up i have not decided i heard there is some people you know if you want to be like a you can even do teaching over there like teach english or you can be a a nanny it is like so you know it is like if i you know the right right right position opens up i might not be coming back anytime soon really 

Recording: (10072/ 10721) 
it is like down a hill kinda by the horseshoe yeah so that is where we go and i do not have a student id so i just sneak in but it is the summer they do not even care they never 

Recording: (10073/ 10721) 
it did okay it is still around it just did not do as good as i thought it was going to do dumb morons what idiot does not put a 35 drive on a computer that was stupid that was just dumb marketing that was dumb marketing i never use it i do everything i have got all kinds of verdicts yeah 

Recording: (10074/ 10721) 
but he is also like i said he is got five kids they live in lowincome housing they are collecting welfare 

Recording: (10075/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10076/ 10721) 
i am not 

Recording: (10077/ 10721) 
for the profit down but then i always will find another project so and i rehab houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that 

Recording: (10078/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10079/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (10080/ 10721) 
and so eventually he did he just got used to her 

Recording: (10081/ 10721) 
so i gave myself a long weekend yeah it is i wish i had been last weekend it was real nice last weekend so i gave myself a long weekend catch up sleep a little bit run around my daughter is getting ready to go to italy so that is 

Recording: (10082/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (10083/ 10721) 
that kind of stuff so it was mostly like what we would do is we would talk about we would talk about like medication like as far as why you are in labor 

Recording: (10084/ 10721) 
or anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sort of make known to them but not something that i would really push on them 

Recording: (10085/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10086/ 10721) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (10087/ 10721) 
yeah yep 

Recording: (10088/ 10721) 
no i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before the health class did but if the parent is not going to get there it is the only way they are ever going to find out 

Recording: (10089/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (10090/ 10721) 
was really great i mean it is just nice laid back country setting and you do not have to worry about that much crime while your horse might get taken in i am gonna go out in the middle of the night but i do not have any horses 

Recording: (10091/ 10721) 
and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music honest i do mrs please let me listen to my headphones but then they can not hear you when you say ok the time is up stop now or whatever you are going hey hey poke him so i do not usually let the kids listen to their get phones maybe the last week of school in june or something or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i do not because i get too out 

Recording: (10092/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (10093/ 10721) 
a parakeet yes a little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (10094/ 10721) 
a little bit of both i think i looked into some phonics i went to the library checked out some phonics tapes let him watch those because kids love to watch things and just reading with them and going over things and it is been amazing just to see it is like the light bulb comes on 

Recording: (10095/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10096/ 10721) 
right right i think there is so many small communities like even though osu has really obviously its own little community and then you have got dublin and they have their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that there really is a lot of things to do in that own individual area i can not see somebody from dublin going over to the west side to do anything you know what i do not and maybe also i feel safer where i live too and that is something that is an issue for me i know 

Recording: (10097/ 10721) 
but it is a very unstructured and nonstructured environment which my son would not have worked in and they do not have sports but these kids get scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and we are talking big money scholars full scholarships so if they are able to do it there at that one school you know they could 

Recording: (10098/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10099/ 10721) 
but that economy is coming along too it is developing itself which is nice i took a tour of a plant down there my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day a day but they get bused into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because they are 

Recording: (10100/ 10721) 
it is just you know 

Recording: (10101/ 10721) 
at this point i blame it on the administration and the citizens of columbus have an i mean two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levy you should never defeat a school levy 

Recording: (10102/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10103/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (10104/ 10721) 
and how are you and i know like one point in time it is like we do not want to hang out with you crystal i am like well fine i do not care i will go hang out with them it is like they still need to do a lot of growing up 

Recording: (10105/ 10721) 
and have the two daughters 

Recording: (10106/ 10721) 
mmmm 

Recording: (10107/ 10721) 
yeah i could be in the something really like multimedia like that it is like uh how they designed it 

Recording: (10108/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (10109/ 10721) 
or is it a student visa or a tourist visa 

Recording: (10110/ 10721) 
i can not eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to las vegas with my dad my mom did not cook it at home which i am glad she did did not the smell of fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out in tears to a rash i mean it was like a heat rash it started on my neck 

Recording: (10111/ 10721) 
i used to fish and stuff like that but i have had skin cancer i have had poor heart attacks and if you look at my skin now you see all the blisters and stuff on it 

Recording: (10112/ 10721) 
yeah to me that is sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done that the kid did and you do not want him to do it again and let it go i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so it is probably not the whole story yeah it is 

Recording: (10113/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (10114/ 10721) 
by the end i was pretty much just puking up blood and passing out a lot 

Recording: (10115/ 10721) 
yes we are both i have gotten kind of bad but my husband is a marathon trainer i try to run with her at least two to three times a week she is he is too fast for her but we go to like hoffman farms up in off a cause grain hilliard i am not sure if it is in hilliard but we have taken her to the soyota park 

Recording: (10116/ 10721) 
that is what i am talking about 

Recording: (10117/ 10721) 
you know they i mean i personally would not care you know as long as if i was in a foxhole with somebody i could care less whether he is gay or not as long as he can shoot a gun you know to help me out if i was in trouble so 

Recording: (10118/ 10721) 
is do not you where you web out an idea you 

Recording: (10119/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10120/ 10721) 
i am a freelance artist illustrator in fact marketing communications for ohio state is one of my big clients and i also have various parttime jobs for the medical insurance 

Recording: (10121/ 10721) 
really i know so it is like the same deal with canada you know like how it used to be owned by okay 

Recording: (10122/ 10721) 
your kid would be thrown in jail you would be getting sued for not having insurance 

Recording: (10123/ 10721) 
you know now 

Recording: (10124/ 10721) 
there is a mild fear it seems that cops always 

Recording: (10125/ 10721) 
you can be an independent 

Recording: (10126/ 10721) 
she works she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that and that is a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there is there is so many different factors there you know she says it is so hard to see somebody 30 years old and they come in and they have a breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says you know two or three times a week you know your heart just drops out because you see 

Recording: (10127/ 10721) 
and i do not know whether orrin did or not he is never said anything if he has i think my attitude would be do not tell the guys that come out vary vociferously in 

Recording: (10128/ 10721) 
yeah that was it that is hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you are just like wow wait what were those people thinking yeah 

Recording: (10129/ 10721) 
it is like if america we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might want to get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know same kind of thing but i am not i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (10130/ 10721) 
he will be yeah it is a week from sunday 

Recording: (10131/ 10721) 
i had a social worker i had a social worker you know the whole time they might you know do things different now though but you are supposed to have a caseworker 

Recording: (10132/ 10721) 
you know at penny is or someplace at the mall you know and maybe spend like $80 for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home i would go what did they say you know about your dress and she goes jelena is that you and i go see you clean up really nice i said you know you have the best shape you are ever going to have in your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants i said you know when you get when you get in your 50s and you have got a gut and a big ass you know you could do that 

Recording: (10133/ 10721) 
ha ha ha 

Recording: (10134/ 10721) 
bring this attribute to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you instead of putting you over here in let us say a managerial position which you really do not have any call for but you are there because the money only okay so try and put the attribute to the person and compensate them accordingly which i think we did that we have teachers 

Recording: (10135/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (10136/ 10721) 
to be close so i did not have to drive 

Recording: (10137/ 10721) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean kids like that i could see if they are poor in harlem or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood and a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children their son was doing 

Recording: (10138/ 10721) 
i like johnstown better if you really want to know but there are not as many places to fish up there well is that good enough 

Recording: (10139/ 10721) 
and then they said and after you get your master is you will definitely need your doctorate well you know the people saying this are college people college is a business and it takes a while to realize that if you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships that is good and even now being a person with a semidisability from a brain injury i mean i do not even like to call it 

Recording: (10140/ 10721) 
it is an island but a planet together i liked it there i kind of like it i figured they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this really appeal to me very much i am more interested in the social things than good old special effects i 

Recording: (10141/ 10721) 
well the humans have started it and the man narrating the thing said there was not a single animal that they profiled in the thing that um behave the way it did on its own accord

painfully clear that she should not plan on having a career because she is going to have to raise children at some point which is that is not the way things should work in my belief and the fact that it is like the males telling the daughter this is how how things need to be i think an individual should have the choice but i feel i am concerned about a you

you 

Recording: (10203/ 10721) 
yeah you can not have a beer gut and a big ass and it means you are sloppy and lazy if you do but if a man does it is like my god he is probably got some power behind it him and it is like duh he is probably just as lazy as anybody else it is like you know you know i hate to see girls starving themselves to death you know it is like you know there are certain times in your life where you are going to be fat my youngest daughter has a problem with that i do not know why she is so insecure because she out of the four of us including

Recording: (10205/ 10721) 
yeah plus a lot of work stress that she is had and stuff 

Recording: (10206/ 10721) 
but if you get to the point where there is not then you just have to be in the situation in my situation i think for my parents it is better that they split up because they are both very happy now 

Recording: (10207/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10208/ 10721) 
everybody needs to know that information for credit cards 

Recording: (10209/ 10721) 
i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family immediately following my father is death because there was some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother so my sister and i defended my stepmother mother against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shafted us and so stepmother is evil

improvement in three months and all that kind of it was image and we were saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better we learn to say the negatives in a positive way and that is important you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservatives they want peace 

Recording: (10216/ 10721) 
and it would take like years i would think to implement the program successfully 

Recording: (10217/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (10218/ 10721) 
now most of my paintings were completed before like 1995 1996 before it came back out it was more of a a thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it is suddenly you hear about it more often so that is not a little funny about it used to be probably like i i paint star wars 

Recording: (10219/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (10220/ 10721)

yeah i want to take up a couple music courses and get a little further on that better my education and what it already is i do not consider myself the dumbest person but i know i am not the smartest 

Recording: (10227/ 10721) 
i did not quite understand or hear you

so i took him downstairs and paddled him i have never been anything more sad about it since then 

Recording: (10230/ 10721) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular so we do not look down on the 60s i think the 60s sound and like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we have got all these problems and the other ones 

Recording: (10231/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (10232/ 10721) 
bit and go well maybe it is for the best 

Recording: (10233/ 10721)

so he is not so crazy she was doing this thing where if he did a good job on something she would give him like a fake coin and he would put it in his bank and at the end of the week or something you could cash in and get a video or a video game or something you know that shows responsibility too 

Recording: (10235/ 10721) 
very often i mean maybe like there is like one or two that come during the year

and then i got here i am like i do not care 

Recording: (10237/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (10238/ 10721) 
i do not think so in new york it might be like i say it is a lot more competitive there here i think columbus is and the midwest in general i think is much more open 

Recording: (10239/ 10721) 
whether it is over exaggerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own in firearms but we played with guns and played count all these games so i just wonder whether this is really but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (10240/ 10721) 
and i just can not imagine i had dogs and cats we did and i loved it and i just think kids need that and it is just a different kind of love i think you know they learn from it

Recording: (10258/ 10721) 
mmhmm

Recording: (10262/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10263/ 10721) 
now every once in a while with my grandmother she always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school when she died and sometimes i think boy she would really like it that i was a nurse nurse because i still use her blood pressure cuff and everything she had given me her blood pressure cuff i mean it is very old 

Recording: (10264/ 10721) 
big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill i had all that freedom and i had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in a handbasket summer spring quarter i switched my major to music because i am extremely musically inclined it is one of the gifts that i have gotten that 90

there is literally hundreds of library publications and it is a problem that librarians are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (10267/ 10721) 
and like i say i do not believe that homosexuality is taught i think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be just fine 

Recording: (10268/ 10721) 
i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared kind of shaken up by it but no they are very very serious about designated drivers 

Recording: (10269/ 10721) 
the big things 

Recording: (10270/ 10721) 
but there were one or two eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put hours worth of research into and sketch and it was just 

Recording: (10271/ 10721) 
mmm 

Recording: (10272/ 10721) 
and maybe that is why it is like that 

Recording: (10273/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10274/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10275/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10276/ 10721) 
bye 

Recording: (10277/ 10721) 
but it is a smaller catholic school in st louis 

Recording: (10278/ 10721) 
yeah that is one of the drawbacks 

Recording: (10279/ 10721) 
if not you just get there the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (10280/ 10721) 
so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (10281/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10282/ 10721) 
just i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the textbook they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notes like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um so i think it is when people have real enthusiasm and like you know put a lot of effort into making it not the 

Recording: (10283/ 10721) 
a condominium or something one floor plan 

Recording: (10284/ 10721)

Recording: (10289/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (10290/ 10721)

Recording: (10303/ 10721) 
and of course i think too as in america the farm families you know they wanted that was more labors for the vineyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it just made sense to me in fact it looks like a my family that the children are going to be mostly in twos not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are

Recording: (10376/ 10721)

Recording: (10377/ 10721)

Recording: (10381/ 10721) 
that is a big growing period from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life my mother was always home she was good to come home to because i had friends whose parents were not there and they had to clean and start dinner and they hated it and they feel that they i think a lot of kids parents have money

Recording: (10385/ 10721) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools on that issue i agree with the gambling thing just as long as it is social drinking a sense because if you have people just go out like today i bought a $1 lottery ticket won two bucks off of it so i 

Recording: (10386/ 10721) 
mmhmm right there 

Recording: (10387/ 10721) 
and it is great we have been reengineered last eight years odot downsizing and trying to fit the attributes the person brings of work as opposed to one of the problems i see as an employer supervisor manager a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order to get up there they do not take into consideration the attributes the person has so now we are saying okay if you bring 

Recording: (10388/ 10721)

Recording: (10399/ 10721) 
short essay for a test but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think i would come up with a rubric and i would say you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things i have never been a teacher who is had to assign or grade creative writing i am not sure i would know how to do that 

Recording: (10400/ 10721)

Recording: (10406/ 10721) 
yeah i do not think there should be any more new developments just yet weed out a little bit of the population put one part of the population in this neighborhood and just pretty much divide it all so it is not not too crowded one place and then not too vacant other places 

Recording: (10407/ 10721)

Recording: (10424/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (10425/ 10721) 
and the data they collect is just i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basic data essentially how many people live in a city in the household and what are their ages and race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself 

Recording: (10426/ 10721) 
yeah it is not like there is a face behind the music but not so much too it is not like 

Recording: (10427/ 10721)

Recording: (10433/ 10721) 
maybe we are beyond that we should not always be saying that 

Recording: (10434/ 10721) 
the problem is lack of commitment lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a niche for you you can not be a male oh yeah you want to do the operation i can not be female why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can not be

Recording: (10439/ 10721) 
here 

Recording: (10440/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (10441/ 10721) 
yeah it was just really disgusting how they behaved and a lot of yelling at students and that was really unnecessary they just totally approached it from the wrong point and i mean there were some students that actually were supporting them 

Recording: (10442/ 10721) 
right yeah 

Recording: (10443/ 10721) 
what do you think about that is that going too far or is that giving them necessary information that they are going to need to know i do not know that they would use the information that they had it i do not know 

Recording: (10444/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10445/ 10721) 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday and we believe in the seen and unseen i will never forget it as i recited it for god knows how many years but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits they freak out 

Recording: (10446/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (10447/ 10721)

i really did not because i felt like i was in love with these boys yeah 

Recording: (10455/ 10721)

Recording: (10456/ 10721) 
i know i did not think that much about it oh well i am not doing anything else why not it seems kind of silly to legally have two levels i mean either you are going to do it the hard way or you are not 

Recording: (10457/ 10721)

Recording: (10465/ 10721) 
you just get sent wherever 

Recording: (10466/ 10721) 
and i am saying i could take that route but it would cost me a lot of money that i do not have to get the legal defense and it would be just best for me to take the responsibility i am going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for uh but i am gonna make them come after me you know uh already went to court once and and uh 

Recording: (10467/ 10721)

Recording: (10482/ 10721) 
really so is it is that so like the economy is pretty good right now well right now it is shaky okay not too many dotcoms apparently over there 

Recording: (10483/ 10721) 
that is 

Recording: (10484/ 10721) 
well i can only speak from my relationship my dad was out of town quite a bit when we were growing up so from a maternal aspect you know mom was there all the time and a lot of times she filled both the male and the female the mother and the father role you know as far as punish button or anything like that but it just would depend i know in my respect it 

Recording: (10485/ 10721) 
we were on like each person would be on a team of these kids they would be assigned to these kids and you would go to your team meetings and the doctors the shrinks would go well i got two weeks off at christmas you know they would be bitching and moaning about the fact that we got time off and they did not and i finally came up with the perfect thing one time i said well dr simpson or whatever his name was dr brown you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off 

Recording: (10486/ 10721)

Recording: (10487/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (10488/ 10721) 
brother 

Recording: (10489/ 10721)

mmhmm 

Recording: (10492/ 10721) 
no there is a lot of people that go to church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know makes you a better human being than another human being i believe that most people is basic structure in life if it is based similar to the bible or you could say buddhism or whatever you know that you tend to have a better life than you will if you practice nonbuddhism 

Recording: (10493/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (10494/ 10721) 
but why would you make stricter gun laws when you can not even force your traffic laws 

Recording: (10495/ 10721) 
you 

Recording: (10496/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10497/ 10721)

where we usually film 

Recording: (10505/ 10721)

Recording: (10506/ 10721) 
and that is actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back and moving all my stuff out of storage i have just been on this i am getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it is you know it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded down especially when i have spent so much time just living out of a suitcase you know i just really realize i have so much stuff that i do not need because there you know everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes you know there is not stuff all around everything is more

oh yeah 

Recording: (10510/ 10721) 
why i mean it is part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent then why do not you talk about it and the problem is that they do not know the answer answer and if they do not know the answer if they can not give a firm this is the answer then they avoid it so what do you do if you do not know the answer i try and find i try and find for me what has become the best answer if i do not believe something or i do not know what to believe about something 

Recording: (10511/ 10721) 
i am not saying that it is not right for some people but you know it was not right for my son

he was not a bad kid 

Recording: (10537/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10538/ 10721)

Recording: (10539/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (10540/ 10721)

Recording: (10543/ 10721) 
so if you are not wearing the nikes

there is a web access to some of our systems in manitoba we are putting more uniform on it for everything osu has its own system but they can also connect to our system for things they do not have in their system so i am not sure what system you are talking about 

Recording: (10575/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10576/ 10721) 
so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kind of stupid because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but to hell with all the other ones so is that really fair 

Recording: (10577/ 10721) 
applicants to get more placements for interviews and that sort of thing and i developed that method the mechanism the checklist and stuff i worked on that and then i worked for the last three years in jobs training for economically disadvantaged youth adults and dislocated workers

Recording: (10583/ 10721) 
well he is exporting cars illegally 

Recording: (10584/ 10721)

Recording: (10590/ 10721) 
these editors are so paranoid you know what i mean they are more worried about stopping 

Recording: (10591/ 10721) 
we wanted it to keep on going they just did not need to do like that and then i think once they noticed that the comments were were going to open without them they realized that the university is functioning or was functioning fine without them 

Recording: (10592/ 10721) 
and indigenous cultures throughout the world will tell you and the history will show that those people were revered as gifted 

Recording: (10593/ 10721) 
yeah it was easy 

Recording: (10594/ 10721) 
when i would run away from foster homes 

Recording: (10595/ 10721) 
hmm 

Recording: (10596/ 10721) 
so that is where she went to high school and everything but no i never went out there my exwife is family is here so she can back a couple three times a year and i generally try to hook up with her and it is been a while but as she got older you know she wants to be with her playmates and everything as they get older and having went through that myself i understand that you 

Recording: (10597/ 10721) 
yeah yeah and you do not want to listen to any music with words because then you will start singing the words and then you will not be able to read

Recording: (10600/ 10721) 
yes and no when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it 

Recording: (10601/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10602/ 10721) 
mhm 

Recording: (10603/ 10721) 
i do not agree with it we had gays in there when i was in there you know so 

Recording: (10604/ 10721) 
is it okay i am sorry 

Recording: (10605/ 10721) 
it happens sometimes probably my freshman year in high school we were just walking down high street and i guess we were in the wrong place the wrong time and some people were like yelling stuff and we could not make out what they were saying 

Recording: (10606/ 10721) 
i know that they changed it i know that it used to just be one day i guess because of the health care something like that i feel like a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me i mean unless there is some type of complications i would be perfectly ready to go home you know unless there is something extra that they could do for me there 

Recording: (10607/ 10721) 
do not worry 

Recording: (10608/ 10721) 
no no but 

Recording: (10609/ 10721) 
he is just disruptive and he said ok a week later she said we did not get any bad reports thank you and she said are you going to continue i said yeah it is a lot easier for the rest of you year we have no rad reports from 

Recording: (10610/ 10721) 
i know ever forever another thing is people are the friends of mine are always saying could you take care of my business for me like could i do their checkbook of course i am not going to do their checkbook like this show them how to keep things in order 

Recording: (10611/ 10721) 
yeah then it is come home then it is come home to the and it is so different i do not know it is just the motherly thing the kids just they draw to their mothers you 

Recording: (10612/ 10721) 
yeah well like the catalogs real small and we have like 500000 things and like the catalog has like a hundred of them so that is really annoying too because then people call up with all these like things that we like do not know if we have our computers are really really old like it is like an old style mainframe 

Recording: (10613/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10614/ 10721) 
how are they going to make sure that they will lock us on again i mean that just seems like a waste of money to me all you are doing is letting a company sell a trigger lock for a gun and make somebody have to buy it buy one but you are not gonna make him put it on the gun so 

Recording: (10615/ 10721) 
did this in the mid 60s when we drove up that way in the early 60s there was there were fields there were farms there were there were forests none of that stuff out there and it is just amazing the urban sprawl that is taken over out there 

Recording: (10616/ 10721) 
that goes away about age 8 my kids they are still doing it they might make an 8 from the bottom up instead of from the top down or a 6 from the bottom up i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up you could tell by watching them write that their brain did not work like yours did 

Recording: (10617/ 10721) 
yeah because i have thought about that like well maybe i will just wait a few years and start dating 

Recording: (10618/ 10721) 
how appalling oh yeah yeah my my family my mom especially is just like when are you going to stop doing that yeah because he is 16 months now and i think he is tapering off quite a bit so i think that he will be done soon but i am not pushing him so 

Recording: (10619/ 10721) 
we will see that is not proved out by the approval ratings he still has a higher approval rating than reagan had in his last 18 months so you know people still like what he is done i think that people do not like all the crap that went with him as the pundits on tv they say that and they are still trying to get him before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elizabeth dole they would not have been able to attack on the issue so they would find other things to get him 

Recording: (10620/ 10721) 
i am sitting here now scott i bet you on monday night is game tonight 9 oclock la la la so and so will win you know do not exchange any money or have any money figured out years planned out just you know oh well that is your team that is my team let us go at it 

Recording: (10621/ 10721) 
but it was very difficult for him to be task oriented 

Recording: (10622/ 10721) 
take them to the grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday and i do not do it as regularly now because of the advance in age you know 

Recording: (10623/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10624/ 10721) 
had one while i was there i have two kids 29 and 22 they are real good it 

Recording: (10625/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (10626/ 10721) 
i think 

Recording: (10627/ 10721) 
yeah i am at the end of it all 

Recording: (10628/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (10629/ 10721) 
i am kind of happy i am not doing that anymore it really takes a certain type of person to work for and that is hard to find in that area 

Recording: (10630/ 10721) 
no no but that is what i am saying but that is what i am saying and the same thing is happening when we had a bus thing we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment oh they got the taste of it and then went back home and we did a very unjust thing to those kids and to the families and then when we broke them up we did something else you know we lost that community community involvement so now the parents can not follow their kids to their activities again splitting it up hey we do not want families that is a misnomer 

Recording: (10631/ 10721) 
afterwards too and that is one of the things they have asked for in the adoption agreement and if the couple is willing to do that 

Recording: (10632/ 10721) 
arts and communications but it is been more of a problem than it is been an asset interviewing for jobs people that were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and they are not going to hire me when after a year i would be their your boss so a lot of that is out there regardless of what people say i am not trying to be pessimistic or negative 

Recording: (10633/ 10721) 
that is 

Recording: (10634/ 10721) 
uh-huh yeah they were all right other columbus sally i do not know if you know who she is 

Recording: (10635/ 10721)

Recording: (10637/ 10721) 
archie bunker meets fred flintstone there you go i can not really put him in the category of forest gump because forest gump was a great guy 

Recording: (10638/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (10639/ 10721) 
it is crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything and i have got oh my gosh they are like just give me a list and somebody is like i want to get this and i want to get that so it is just been it is been something else which is good though because our families are pretty similar and they are all 

Recording: (10640/ 10721) 
i do not know where i am going to find you honestly i am thinking of doing a career flight 

Recording: (10641/ 10721) 
i like living in a world where technology is technology puts everything i need at my fingertips i mean i think that is something that would not have happened had there not been a a highly populist generation suddenly that was competing within itself 

Recording: (10642/ 10721) 
he said i did not think you would stand up to me i said well you know what the heck 

Recording: (10643/ 10721)

Recording: (10654/ 10721) 
the bonding 

Recording: (10655/ 10721) 
i tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (10656/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10657/ 10721) 
oh yeah you get a lot of those 

Recording: (10658/ 10721) 
the reason i asked was it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but yeah 

Recording: (10659/ 10721) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government telling me what to do 

Recording: (10660/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (10661/ 10721)

Recording: (10666/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (10667/ 10721) 
if you do that to ten things it is something that is integral to the university is collection it really hits your budget and then there is always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it 

Recording: (10668/ 10721) 
i do 

Recording: (10669/ 10721) 
did not hear about that 

Recording: (10670/ 10721) 
and i guess it worked for them 

Recording: (10671/ 10721) 
to marry him and she moved over and 

Recording: (10672/ 10721) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (10673/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10674/ 10721)

Recording: (10675/ 10721) 
i do not know 

Recording: (10676/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (10677/ 10721)

yeah i know i know i know 

Recording: (10679/ 10721) 
reader is digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level they now write it on the sixth grade level newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level it is just either we are getting more and more ld kids that are not learning to read or kids are just not as motivated because because of video games and things that well i read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set 

Recording: (10680/ 10721)

she has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (10684/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10685/ 10721) 
oh yeah yeah and i think even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is just columbus it is just columbus maybe it is because people do not realize what is actually here yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not san francisco there is a lot of places it is not but it is not a backwater either 

Recording: (10686/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (10687/ 10721) 
yep

Recording: (10689/ 10721) 
a tower works everybody landing and departing or any airplane within five mile radius then once they get out of that radius downstairs which is called the approach control they work everything from there to 10000 feet and out to about 60 miles and when they get to that point then they go to the enroute centers

you 

Recording: (10694/ 10721)

too long or a sentence that is a fragment and it is not a complete thought you are not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you

something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say and you say turn to page 393 or and they turned to 339 in their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the ear 

Recording: (10704/ 10721) 
mmhmm but that is kind of you know kind of came through where they were like when i was growing up we had the you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your we were called deads you know and i was kind of like in the middle you know i played a little bit of snuff you know but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads you know and everything so so i could say i you know i was kind of associated

Recording: (10708/ 10721) 
no painting was needed then as a result they went through and decided since i broke the lease to get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate 

Recording: (10709/ 10721)
