and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or by a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (62/ 8002) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay on my own on my own on my own

gun somewhere else 

Recording: (344/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (345/ 8002) 
none of i mean it is kind of a traditional light at the uh like a big channel was up bright light at the end or they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene uh seeing a dead relative

Recording: (2922/ 8002) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of the those people that participate in the um sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (2923/ 8002) 
oh how is the football game deal 

Recording: (2924/ 8002) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2925/ 8002) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2926/ 8002) 
um-hum

Recording: (2929/ 8002) 
and come back in 

Recording: (2930/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2931/ 8002) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (2932/ 8002) 
um college wise i do not know anyone of college age that is okay 

Recording: (2933/ 8002) 
time to go i made i am down here <laugh>

Recording: (2935/ 8002) 
oh i have to eat it that is funny <laugh> 

Recording: (2936/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (2937/ 8002) 
right she is one of the last year 

Recording: (2938/ 8002) 
uh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (2939/ 8002) 
um and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives on um so i do not think i personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger and more comfortable movie theaters and and that kind of stuff that has not really really um 

Recording: (2940/ 8002) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what night and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrust back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (2941/ 8002) 
because considerable they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (2942/ 8002) 
right well let me ask you uh about somebody else he is not that well know do you know john cork uh have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is he is funny in his own songs he is the folksinger really and i have got three or something he does the heat of his voice and stuff to the line somebody i mean he does the good he is really worth and i have heard of him 

Recording: (2943/ 8002) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really you should do it and you know you should do it and do it 

Recording: (2944/ 8002) 
but usually she is looking for something to eat you know <laugh> 

Recording: (2945/ 8002)

Recording: (2948/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2949/ 8002) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well uh so i mean that is kind of a tough question and it is almost it is something that the age of the end of the being talking to be talking to be obviously at the age of the age of the 

Recording: (2950/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2951/ 8002)

Recording: (3065/ 8002) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter they mean if they can make a college to their easy life they are probably going to change that because it is really hurting life 

Recording: (3066/ 8002) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do

Recording: (3273/ 8002) 
oh i felt funny that i am i mean i was with his father for like nine years so i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years until i was sixteen and he did not and he just did not grow up once we had it and so and he did not and he just did not change like i changed and so and so i

i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple of times and i do not know he just impresses me more than 

Recording: (3292/ 8002) 
i think more what they need to do is restrict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that like for the most part i mean people really put it in the people of the country so they need to get back to work for them i mean if you look at other countries i mean if you look at other countries i mean 

Recording: (3293/ 8002)

Recording: (3379/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3380/ 8002) 
oh um-hum 

Recording: (3381/ 8002) 
what is different is my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle was i mean still is my elementary school is sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block of way always snow avenue i mean i am right in this really this area of the elementaryry schools sitting in the elementary i live to this railroad so far from national avenue i live in the river to this river to this river i live to this railroad so far from way from way from the avenue avenue avenue avenue avenue i live in the people i live in the river i live in the river i live in the river i live because it is really i live in the river i live to the river i live to the river i live to the river i live to the river i live to the river i live to the river i live until i live until i live until i live in the river i live in the river i live in the river i live in the river i live in the river i live in the river i live i live i live i live i live in the river i live i live in the so i live in the river i live in the river i live in the so i live in the river i live in the so i live in the so i live in the right so i live in the right from where i live in the right from the right from the right from the right from the right from the right from theivevevevevevevevevevevevevevevea in the a lot i am so i am so i am so i am so i am so i am so i am so i am so i am so i am so i am so and i am in the a i am in the a i am in the a i mean i am in the a and i am in the a and i am in the a i am in the a i mean i am in the a i am in the a i am in the a i am in the i am in the a i am in the a i am in the a i am in i am in the a i 

Recording: (3382/ 8002) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3383/ 8002) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones it is just everyone of them is different 

Recording: (3384/ 8002) 
the south pacific yeah 

Recording: (3385/ 8002) 
it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education basically in education but by i will be gone by the time if it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so it is a real conservative program in education for small school and they just open up with their phd program in education and they are off and on for political science and they are all be gone by the 

Recording: (3386/ 8002) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (3387/ 8002) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (3388/ 8002) 
if if you did not own let us say on the school i mean you did not know you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time the school tax passes my rent goes up at least it it is a bill to be or i have a pretty dumb backyard <laugh> i am very angry and i do not i do not i do not live to live to pay my rent and i do not live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to pay them i have 

Recording: (3389/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there is something missing in the uh uh the child is life you know was not getting perhaps uh those attention to uh you know the parenting in particular i do not uh the child is life you know 

Recording: (3390/ 8002) 
that would be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (3391/ 8002) 
you can find it all over the place 

Recording: (3392/ 8002) 
oh good 

Recording: (3393/ 8002)

Recording: (3396/ 8002)

Recording: (3397/ 8002) 
and then they said well since you are getting that we will cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under the on the printed program 

Recording: (3398/ 8002) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (3399/ 8002) 
just mount tapes uh do print out the monitor systems uh that people have problems help solve them 

Recording: (3400/ 8002)

my dad is the only weird well some of his brothers and sisters are kind of out there too but <laugh> 

Recording: (3444/ 8002) 
you are allowed to have guests at the same side so they could say like i do not live in the dorms but the thing i did if i were not if i would a girl come from home to visit me i would have to either sneak or and and like just hope we did not get caught or have her stay at a friends 

Recording: (3445/ 8002) 
i think is gonna be in mind no personally i i have a very close for range so i have never been very in the dump in my family anyway you know we did not even have grand here at all of our grand is our 

Recording: (3446/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3447/ 8002) 
been to do that 

Recording: (3448/ 8002) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (3449/ 8002) 
yeah um-hum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so you know to do those things so you can not compare it but you know there are culturally to doing columbus and it does sort of make cultural at home to you know people i can not even 

Recording: (3450/ 8002) 
um-hum i was at u children and i was not even in u children it was a hundred thousand you know and uh i would love that but i then i came back and i live in oldentown she village which is right on the river and it is very beautiful very neat 

Recording: (3451/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3452/ 8002) 
<laugh> yeah 

Recording: (3453/ 8002) 
the right 

Recording: (3454/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (3455/ 8002) 
exactly exactly i yeah that is that is true 

Recording: (3456/ 8002) 
it is 

Recording: (3457/ 8002) 
and to me that is considered suburban so and to me ashe is considered the sticks i mean there is people there is onish buggy is that go by 

Recording: (3458/ 8002) 
ah i can not i can not believe it they came back 

Recording: (3459/ 8002) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (3460/ 8002) 
um-hum that was in sixty nine is when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was that 

Recording: (3461/ 8002) 
home back um yeah i am sure that was useful for people that did not cook or do anything showed them how to turn the oven on or 

Recording: (3462/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (3463/ 8002) 
um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (3464/ 8002) 
because there is no fear being caught by the parents there is 

Recording: (3465/ 8002) 
ah probably 

Recording: (3466/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (3467/ 8002)

Recording: (3468/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3469/ 8002)

Recording: (3470/ 8002) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be another thing above you know if there is that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (3471/ 8002) 
that is 

Recording: (3472/ 8002) 
you know that is a real major question that uh no i do not think it is too bad i mean uh well uh well we could go into the issue of uh the columbus board of education what is his name always always um 

Recording: (3473/ 8002)

Recording: (3474/ 8002) 
exactly 

Recording: (3475/ 8002)

i 

Recording: (4033/ 8002) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i always think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that uh basically the same uh they obviously do need to make it more severe um but i mean they obviously do need to be more severe because they obviously are basically child or neglectic into penalty that you know

a parakeet yet little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (4090/ 8002) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who is a philadelphiaian teacher and her her family major and actually her brother is a fellow in that moment well then she is apparently her family in the family and she is she is double major in the major history and she is a double major major major in that

Recording: (4165/ 8002) 
i at this point i blame it on the administration uh 

Recording: (4166/ 8002) 
yeah they just kick him to the hallway he was either you know in the hallway or in uh the office and and then ones would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivial questions 

Recording: (4167/ 8002) 
and i could not walk at all 

Recording: (4168/ 8002)

Recording: (4172/ 8002) 
which was a going thing 

Recording: (4173/ 8002) 
you know what um actually i do not believe they have anything book so far a lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come into their homes and things i have usually i have worked for different hotels where i have always worked on new year is eve but we do not even have any plants going to california so i am going to be decent friends from california so i am going to california so i am going to work 

Recording: (4174/ 8002) 
that 

Recording: (4175/ 8002) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i would think 

Recording: (4176/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4177/ 8002) 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (4178/ 8002) 
i think when you have two and three pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (4179/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4180/ 8002) 
yeah it was pretty much up from middle class 

Recording: (4181/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4182/ 8002) 
you probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarian but there is some for public too 

Recording: (4183/ 8002) 
yeah and uh he was really into nice and nice and warm and dry and the thing just a little less in the future she was right in the front of the 

Recording: (4184/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (4185/ 8002) 
you went to be he was going to be a the gossip i heard was that uh uh the super and did not it schools said that if he was reelected and she was going to be signed and so they gave her a big raise <laugh> 

Recording: (4186/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4187/ 8002) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of a a three year old can in how much do you have to have of the senate to pass the law you know it can be something real real technical or something 

Recording: (4188/ 8002) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (4189/ 8002) 
oh somehow really yeah <laugh> and if they if everybody would just begin to be able that way and when they started to say something nice you would think well i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (4190/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4191/ 8002) 
i hope not some of these longer to go around and always predict the worst things like everybody is saying then that you know two thousand happens do not go out and separate news the year is well it is got a end we will how does it go to end you know uh 

Recording: (4192/ 8002) 
that was a lot of old pinkie you know and that is something that the old freeze has used to be more free than the new 

Recording: (4193/ 8002) 
no offhand caesar trying to call up 

Recording: (4194/ 8002) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (4195/ 8002) 
<laugh> i have seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder it is like the same thing they over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (4196/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4197/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4198/ 8002) 
<laugh> well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just want to shoot somebody unfortunately anybody that says that i i mean i am i do not even like stepping on the edge but there is those moments where you are like oh 

Recording: (4199/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (4200/ 8002) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh so it seems like there is a lot more to do upon call this obviously but 

Recording: (4201/ 8002) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i do not think you are going to get into that 

Recording: (4202/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (4203/ 8002) 
this is not this is not that whole just because they are not home 

Recording: (4204/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (4205/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4206/ 8002) 
um-hum okay 

Recording: (4207/ 8002) 
well i do not know if it is been around town here 

Recording: (4208/ 8002) 
it is just out of control i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they can be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (4209/ 8002) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he would do a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (4210/ 8002) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choice 

Recording: (4211/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4212/ 8002) 
oh yeah i think everybody should if nothing else she missed a boat by that time 

Recording: (4213/ 8002) 
you can not see it in a day 

Recording: (4214/ 8002) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (4215/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4216/ 8002) 
well that is good that is good tell me 

Recording: (4217/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4218/ 8002) 
um so i think that part definitely helps where as much to my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um where like i said i have already done all this stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (4219/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4220/ 8002) 
and ones you like them to see that you do not like 

Recording: (4221/ 8002)

Recording: (4914/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4915/ 8002) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies cry and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time so that i would not have to always have to cry and i would not have to work after they were in bed so that i would not go back to work so that i would not go back to work after i would not go back to work after i would not have to work so they would not have to work after i would not have to work after it so they would not have to work so they would not have it so they would not have it so they would not have it so they would not have it so they would not have it so they would not have it so they would not have it so they would not have it so they would not so they would not so they would not so they so they so they so they so they so they so they so they so they so they so they so they so they so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it so it soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit so it so it soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit soit so crimeit so crimeit so probablyit so ohit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit couldit coulditititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititit

Recording: (5227/ 8002) 
a lot of people have switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (5228/ 8002)

Recording: (5275/ 8002) 
okay so they it seems like an independent contract for them 

Recording: (5276/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5277/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5278/ 8002)

no somebody has heard somebody gets 

Recording: (5287/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5288/ 8002) 
i mean it goes back more towards a curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5289/ 8002) 
crime and stuff uh i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years in atlanta i would not say he is made he is better off financially overall uh yeah and i and i do not think he is made any mistakes i do not i would not say he is made any major made ever 

Recording: (5290/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5291/ 8002)

Recording: (5292/ 8002)

Recording: (5293/ 8002) 
back then i was working at a cycle shop but i was in the service while i was working there 

Recording: (5294/ 8002) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5295/ 8002) 
yeah oh my uh i am in this uh venturing crew which is their boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (5296/ 8002)

Recording: (5305/ 8002) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago but that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (5306/ 8002) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (5307/ 8002) 
and i think at some times they do not even count all the voted i mean sometimes they really want it to go do bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen is somehow or whether they will count it so did or they will you know i 

Recording: (5308/ 8002) 
the part now it takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching 

Recording: (5309/ 8002)

Recording: (5313/ 8002) 
how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry these these things out i think it is it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (5314/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5315/ 8002)

Recording: (6457/ 8002) 
and it is interesting that they advertise that when you go there though if you get that room that is what you get 

Recording: (6458/ 8002) 
the risk again what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone that high part of it

Recording: (6463/ 8002) 
so like thirty of them will go out at one time and thirty will come back well that is not too bad but they are mixed in with everybody else that is normally flying like all the airwaves and stuff so and they want to get their a it is amazing you know i i just do not feel comfortable doing that much at one time i mean not that i wish it was very it was like the third base of ohio but uh yeah it is amazing ohio but uh but uh you know it is amazing ohio but i just 

Recording: (6464/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6465/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6466/ 8002)

it 

Recording: (6469/ 8002) 
oh definitely definitely well i have never had a dog and i have always wanted one 

Recording: (6470/ 8002) 
you know because that was what did he have to write and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggle and if he becomes president he did not know that three liters of the world thing and then on top of it like taxes is a fairly big economy but still they it is mange big economy you know an entire economy 

Recording: (6471/ 8002) 
yeah i do not understand it i really have a hard time understanding you know they are not after you they just want a liberal life 

Recording: (6472/ 8002) 
um well i have had the house excuse me um for probably six or seven years and we just need to move it is kind of small this smaller house and um my husband works in gahana so we were going to look for some land and be looking at land up north too 

Recording: (6473/ 8002) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6474/ 8002) 
and it stays with you for years <laugh> they do not realize that nobody tells them until after the fact <laugh> 

Recording: (6475/ 8002) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher uh i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people i mean so they just they are lucky enough to even have their body to fill the the 

Recording: (6476/ 8002) 
so the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (6477/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6478/ 8002) 
it is very difficult 

Recording: (6479/ 8002) 
<laugh> he needs counseling <laugh> at that point <laugh> 

Recording: (6480/ 8002) 
yeah so uh is your dog at home if you are here

Recording: (6482/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6483/ 8002) 
i i been impressed them like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look like anything 

Recording: (6484/ 8002) 
that is probably family by family i means that we <laugh> that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there there we have got two coworkers hours one um has her child with the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and i am listening to her and she is seven d hours a week i mean she is um jobs at d hours a week i mean she is um job but i mean she is a job that six at three hours a week and she is um and has a job she is um and she is a job she is um and she is um and i mean she is a job she is um and she is um and she is um and she is um and she is um and she is um and she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um and i mean she is um i mean she is a hours and i mean i mean i mean she is a hours and i mean i mean i mean i mean she is a hours i mean i mean i mean i mean she is a her hours i mean i mean i mean she is so i mean i am driving dhe hours i mean and i mean and i mean to were i meaned i am am am am am am am am am amthat i mean that isi mean that isi have and i mean that i mean that isi mean that i mean that isi mean and i am and i am and i am and i am and i am and i am and i am and i am and i am and that and that and that and that isi mean that isi mean that isi am and i am and i am and i am and that i am and that and that and that and that 

Recording: (6485/ 8002) 
yeah i think so i think so and they they just you know the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me you know so 

Recording: (6486/ 8002) 
she got divorced when i was three 

Recording: (6487/ 8002) 
you do not you do not use coupons 

Recording: (6488/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6489/ 8002) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6490/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6491/ 8002) 
but when you look at coming he they things there was a point where they they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (6492/ 8002) 
then you can go visit what the upires that the big thing like the such a liberty 

Recording: (6493/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6494/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6495/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6496/ 8002) 
i do not want to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what it is doing it is not 

Recording: (6497/ 8002) 
that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i have been cross trained or however you want to say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raise even i am doing three jobs and i have seen me get two percent raise when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (6498/ 8002) 
um about fifteen minutes my mom and i do not go too far from each other so but jayson is going to take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (6499/ 8002) 
i think society as to day after day is to less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting along with this stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being black or something uh back in uh the sixties and stuff but you know uh so now there are not you know for being uh black and down in their back yard so 

Recording: (6500/ 8002) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she still that she lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (6501/ 8002) 
um i do more summer sports but uh he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer literally i have really never had a job yet and it is always been working with his or plan 

Recording: (6502/ 8002) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate of public schools for them 

Recording: (6503/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6504/ 8002) 
oh this other stuff uh what i am going to tell you what i am going to write down you know my voice is not my uh my name is you my uh my name is you my uh my name is you and i have a little one of these little ones that i have write down yeah those are

Recording: (7722/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7723/ 8002) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that lee way <laugh> but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of and towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair uh not cutting down ones that i have like cut yeah yeah yeah and i would have 

Recording: (7724/ 8002) 
kids 

Recording: (7725/ 8002) 
but it was not because it caught fire from that time even going on the back 

Recording: (7726/ 8002) 
so he was able to circumvent anything that this i called him just was trying to tell him he had finally admitted it yeah he had a problem and then things went much more smoothly and they they are still not really because he was trying to rule the government of the 

Recording: (7727/ 8002) 
uh so uh we can give it twenty seven 

Recording: (7728/ 8002)

hope the curb <laugh> 

Recording: (7736/ 8002) 
um-hum sure 

Recording: (7737/ 8002) 
no that is one thing that i you know i found was really lacking here um for my side uh 

Recording: (7738/ 8002) 
i mean obviously being uh being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (7739/ 8002) 
he is really he is yeah he does not think through the application that the thing is real well made for a somebody 

Recording: (7740/ 8002) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (7741/ 8002) 
yeah james and james and i went together 

Recording: (7742/ 8002) 
yeah you even got these uh stunk guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (7743/ 8002) 
that does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i say just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (7744/ 8002) 
see that they are again the business out box the consumer basically you need to do less cons in buying material goods and sharing your time with one other try to understand your neighbor more and spending time getting quality time for understand the tangy the tangy ones and we will be in the same and they will be appreciate and we will be on the tell me and they are um and we will be appreciateate and we will be and they are and we will be gone and sharing your investments gone and we will be gone and sharing your time and sharing your time and sharing and we will be gone and we will be gone and we will be gone and we will be gone and we will be in theiandables depreciated and we will be appreciate and we will be and we will be in the and we will be in thei and sharing thei and sharing thei and sharing the and sharing thes and they are and they are and they are and they are and they are and we will be in thes thes thes thes thes thes and they are and they are and they are so you are so you are so you are people is gone and we will be back and we will be back and we will be back and we will be back and we will be back and we will be back and we will be back and we are being seemingseeables depreciateds depreciated and we are gone and we are gone and we are gone and we are seemingsee soand soandsoably and we are soandsoably and they seemingsee so and they seemingsee so and they seeming the that is so and theysee so that is so thatsee the that issee the that issee the that issee the that issee the that issee the that issee the that issee the beenseeablesabablysseeablesseeablesseeablesseeablesseeablesseeablesinsootablyseeables depreciables depreciables depreciables depreciateds depreciateds depreci been been been

on the other thing is to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know and i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (7747/ 8002) 
oh yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (7748/ 8002) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7749/ 8002) 
to me that was very strange 

Recording: (7750/ 8002) 
so it is always going to be somebody can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something or make some taste but you know that is about all that does about all that they want to do is to come to cooking you know everybody most people know if they do have to cook 

Recording: (7751/ 8002) 
yeah it is weird they i do not know this makes sense a little bit different so 

Recording: (7752/ 8002) 
good 

Recording: (7753/ 8002) 
i love it 

Recording: (7754/ 8002)

Recording: (7755/ 8002) 
no i mean the money you know the money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offer the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they the signing but they settled four and now it is because the big theaation was back that these people did not want to be settled from the fact that these people did not actually they do not actually 

Recording: (7756/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7757/ 8002) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (7758/ 8002) 
um i mean i feel uh they are on the human rights side of the you know i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night the other night about they were offering um crack mothers and they was a big debate about that um but again i do not have a problem actually i saw something actually on the news the other news the other night 

Recording: (7759/ 8002) 
because see well i have five babies you know i really have to work when you talk about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (7760/ 8002) 
i know that is okay i i just do not want to touch it 

Recording: (7761/ 8002) 
the reds and indians 

Recording: (7762/ 8002)
