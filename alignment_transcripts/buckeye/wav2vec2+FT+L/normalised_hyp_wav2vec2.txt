Recording: (33/ 10720)

Recording: (34/ 10720) 
h 

Recording: (35/ 10720) 
no with the system 

Recording: (36/ 10720) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something and i do not want to deal with or what not um so i mean the fact that i mean people of the same sex are living together ar married or whatnot that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that id 

Recording: (37/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (38/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (39/ 10720)

Recording: (46/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (47/ 10720) 
h 

Recording: (48/ 10720) 
i mean the are people who think cars will not run 

Recording: (49/ 10720) 
of course that never happened 

Recording: (50/ 10720) 
it is all up to a human being if they want ta change if they got their mind set on they do not want to be with the you know their other sex i do not think ey can change them you know that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (51/ 10720) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was he and when he is fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finished school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money and i mean we do not need to have a tun but we just should be at least a little out of debt so yeah something 

Recording: (52/ 10720) 
yeah i know hk gisnikis bumps it is such a shame 

Recording: (53/ 10720) 
something like that i do not i do not know much about it 

Recording: (54/ 10720) 
and thit if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebell 

Recording: (55/ 10720) 
with that situation 

Recording: (56/ 10720) 
hu <laugh> 

Recording: (57/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (58/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (59/ 10720) 
you know i was sitting down uh in my boy friend is room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone i had my computer on but nobody was sitting at it 

Recording: (60/ 10720) 
so i you know they pile a you resemble that remarker you know 

Recording: (61/ 10720) 
for me to even think about 

Recording: (62/ 10720) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like black as and all this you know they are prejudiced and all she is doing is yelling about being their rjudence against her because what she do not understand itis her dam job 

Recording: (63/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (64/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (65/ 10720) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time were we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both of the world so 

Recording: (66/ 10720) 
except for their names wore changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (67/ 10720) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special certificut you are sertified kindergarten through twelfh so i did several years in the high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary whille my kids ware in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that 

Recording: (68/ 10720) 
they have always been there i mean you know uh i do not really care what the uh guy is specific thing is if he is in a fox hole with me you know and as long as he can shoot a gun uh <laugh> you know i mean i could care w i have got gay friends you know so 

Recording: (69/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (70/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (71/ 10720) 
it really is not <laugh> it really is great 

Recording: (72/ 10720) 
eah 

Recording: (73/ 10720) 
they will be naked but they will still go in with a huge towl on 

Recording: (74/ 10720) 
i mean uh like uh what is his name the who wrote the book you wl just 

Recording: (75/ 10720) 
hich could change 

Recording: (76/ 10720) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (77/ 10720) 
i have not taken him there yet 

Recording: (78/ 10720) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation or that you can be converted to homo sexuality and i personally do not believe that so it uh you know i am not affraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this co comes from but since i think they are wrong <laugh> i 

Recording: (79/ 10720) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person shoud just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (80/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (81/ 10720) 
but i am using miloans example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me wrong 

Recording: (82/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (83/ 10720) 
i just did not want to do that a lot of people do that but you know it is just such an investment then when you leave and 

Recording: (84/ 10720) 
yeah more yeah oare more you know i d ot i do not even know because is it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together they hase to work it is going ta be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about alian this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is thi 

Recording: (85/ 10720) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (86/ 10720) 
her house in india is like this mantcion and they have servents there i man it is really impressive just the house s are just worth more so you can not get as much house here but yeah everybody is doing well 

Recording: (87/ 10720) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (88/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (89/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (90/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (91/ 10720) 
not as an individual uh wet see that is a problem i have it is hard to find a balance between senswership and you know free flow of information uh and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running which i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while a i it is kind of interesting to watch these people uh but 

Recording: (92/ 10720) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (93/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (94/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (95/ 10720) 
yeah it is i keep it was not but then i moves well there we go 

Recording: (96/ 10720) 
but you do not really have to work sare there apparently 

Recording: (97/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (98/ 10720) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes some different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look at like whell one of my friends have to do it and say whel ino i have to do it you know they look at it like it is a big pain because they got it run over to the nurse and 

Recording: (99/ 10720) 
you do not you do not use cupons 

Recording: (100/ 10720) 
and aparently that is a way of endising in a conversation uh one of the guys i usually go clothing with he is one to got me into the low stick dancing and he said uh he ay hit is like a sign that says come hit on me you knw am like oh great that is that is just what i need thatt does not bother me dhos not bother me i just i just i sort of just i am jut like o you know i am straight if they start if they start getting really you know really push y about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is really funny because i will gtting the conversation with thim and they will bel like you are straight are not you i am like yoa 

Recording: (101/ 10720) 
and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were iaming each other and uh he sort of pushd me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the 

Recording: (102/ 10720) 
uh i blew a diskout 

Recording: (103/ 10720) 
oh not very right o and i twenty twenty years first twenty years i worked at the burow i was worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they are misinterpreted and my wife ha has been ae director of institutional research at the university uh a data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there uh 

Recording: (104/ 10720)

Recording: (111/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (112/ 10720) 
and go ahead and shay well know sometimes she will ask sometimes she does but let us assume she did she asked is it i all right if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and so forth she puts them right in there and that think u with those other dishes makes no efforts to clean them a and i i i have seen this and many many many incidents but i am griving you this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society 

Recording: (113/ 10720) 
al ways thinking of grandchildren 

Recording: (114/ 10720) 
i think he is in prison and um he has no driver is licensed privileges for life and you know it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff 

Recording: (115/ 10720)

Recording: (117/ 10720) 
which are children of light 

Recording: (118/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (119/ 10720) 
it right 

Recording: (120/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (121/ 10720) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (122/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (123/ 10720) 
nd but ynou know that there in goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean if obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so myserable in his life that he was going down in the stairs in the basement to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his nevervana or whatever you know and uh than his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (124/ 10720) 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um uh i think there is something else in the bible where you know she the he lady gives gives only a small portion compared to a large portion but in relation to what her income was thiat meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved than that we need to promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialize we need to think more of that but i think it ealy take home at night what would you beu doing if your third world country did not have a choice 

Recording: (125/ 10720) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (126/ 10720) 
all right now i am kind of job motivated 

Recording: (127/ 10720) 
statis 

Recording: (128/ 10720) 
uh it is 

Recording: (129/ 10720) 
eahbut fifty years ago if you had ebelepse they would lock you in the closet and throg ha wa the kee wh they let you out most of the parents i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids with a stepparen

<laugh> 

Recording: (134/ 10720)

Recording: (135/ 10720)

Recording: (136/ 10720) 
and ithink there as an article this last wensday in the dispach and business section as to how the p u still can not regulate it and because that they want to de regulate tell communications uh and so for the past months we have not been getting telvhon bills for usage we had the backbon we are paying for mand what is going to happen ow this whole thing is het offers us a a a lot of la too wheare where uh we can now uh if we have a contractor let us say over 

Recording: (137/ 10720)

Recording: (958/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (959/ 10720) 
that is it that is what i worry about the larger school systems too wel that is what concerns me with hillur you get such a large variety of peopple compared to like where i was and the smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it is your parents knew their parent yeah your parents knew their parents their parents e th you know now you know and i walked to my friend is house and half her friends if she is going over to play they are gin to drive them almost because they are they are all around so

Recording: (961/ 10720) 
really enjoy one of the hings i do not like about living in the big city is is like but i have gotten used to but i i do not like fackt that every time you look up in the night skuy all that you see is this like orange haiyse <laugh> you can not see stars very well uh the noise y i mean there is always n noiys i remember last you are living in the dorms every morning at two thirty in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in tayler so it is 

Recording: (962/ 10720) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy togetherhe only thing that is going ta happen is it is going to chuckle down and you are going to have to listen to them being myserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miyserable and they fight and then you feel like it yo you know people say it is my fault because thitis happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um 

Recording: (963/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (964/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (965/ 10720) 
yeah

yeah 

Recording: (984/ 10720)

they think everything they say is helarious oh it is just middle school i think it i transitioning from childhood to a duld hood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not rite and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is it it is exasterbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (1210/ 10720) 
i think outside of the honerst program a lot of it is but within the honerst program i think there is some really really exceptional things going on 

Recording: (1211/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1212/ 10720) 
h so there i there is no faultig that i meet for these folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative and responsed to say to this experience so you end up with youre kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately following ion never mind pretend i never said that <laugh>

uh what the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at eight am well an airport has so many runways and so many taxiways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there in a hold while there you know shooting them in what they do is they

Recording: (2229/ 10720) 
so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have student college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh but once in a whilewe will get wind players that play in it also and uh sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something

the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of yourself it of others and i think as you as we become older you start thinking about how uh much your weknesses are but really your weeknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here p uh professes to be the thing

um-hum 

Recording: (2563/ 10720) 
i have that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not work tin the ways that other people is do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real lot more temporamental we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things are not um even tempored ore not things you would use to describe me nik but but but

Recording: (2587/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (2588/ 10720) 
because it is more open um and you couch it in terms of civil rights um my boy friendis thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based 

Recording: (2589/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2590/ 10720) 
than i 

Recording: (2591/ 10720) 
yoes to but that more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh maybe even today tit is less than that because it is been a because of ta loss of a parent orr inability of a parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage thout is got 

Recording: (2592/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (2593/ 10720) 
eahit is it is nice it works thout well 

Recording: (2594/ 10720) 
you can not especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (2595/ 10720) 
and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (2596/ 10720) 
you start thing little diferently and i think as you are talkou shoud be talking to some older people i am seeing people in the in the eighties to find out how the progression of life is and how you think because when you go to a state sales all you are talking about this problem motive there rs siting on ther lawns the quality of life is in the mind of the person youare you you avoid it all the time 

Recording: (2597/ 10720)

Recording: (2602/ 10720) 
argruy about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can canseev and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what geen shey you might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not later on you will find out but it is still you can go back and you can find the parent and 

Recording: (2603/ 10720) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe or kno i think it is a high school andmarian was built on um an old weapons deepo and so like lukiemia is rison and so like that is what their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things uh a their they do anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (2604/ 10720) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to hi yeah there is a lot there there iss way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europei s like okay i will go to europe

and just because you are i mean ow i was not really uh ann athletic i did jst play uh sports when i was in in high school but i wl dancer was not any good you know s this not like other guys but whether i did or whether i did not you know i wold i do not i do not nobody picked on me non i mean one time i got into it wa with one of the uh centers in football you know a big old guy and bean uh an i was still about saying size but

boring 

Recording: (2709/ 10720) 
rg 

Recording: (2710/ 10720) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah i just a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (2711/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2712/ 10720) 
just getting over there 

Recording: (2713/ 10720)

Recording: (2717/ 10720)

Recording: (2718/ 10720) 
ou know becas i on what dos he have to hide and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage than entire you know antire economy 

Recording: (2719/ 10720) 
i guess that happened just here in town uh couple of hem about a week ago or something like that you know where a guy shot another guyy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes early you know a who is really the faut and who is really e who is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh not t tay ever would have but if if one of the two that you in calamba and you know if they would have survived i would like 

Recording: (2720/ 10720) 
i think um the people who have already graduated there like to the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids did not an to go hit it is just thought of it is a somewhat party school 

Recording: (2721/ 10720) 
oh definitely definitely well i have never had a dog and i have aways wanted one 

Recording: (2722/ 10720) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicin everyday just like git is mine take mine everyday and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is uh some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on influence of medication or ar off the influence of medication um in case 

Recording: (2723/ 10720) 
think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidate a over candidate be because they will protect abortion rights that is going nto divide the country and not keep us together

Recording: (2728/ 10720) 
g um i think the fact things like responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know things as far as people getting pregnant and and then this person goes off and and you have d you have got a lot of un married single women that are all by themselves and and

Recording: (3095/ 10720) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked but i aranged my life around her so that even tho i had that degree i wait at tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunchas

Recording: (3215/ 10720) 
and it is like i i like how i hickt i thought about going to antiock but it was it was really expensive and like um i do not know but just because it s that and in schools more of ah nontraditional uh typeweare they give you like avaluations and you do not get grades like and so so then it that is what i that i what i heard it is like in anniock where the professor rites uh like a couple f page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that i mean that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved in noticing what

Recording: (3828/ 10720) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is a pretty decent person i mean i do not think ha there is anything violent or there just anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and make som big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that is sort of what people l pick up their perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helphing people out or things like that when the local hide

ell i got the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun and waiys around the school you know that is the big thing now but just the you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support cr up through the administration an if they do have a they have to wait untill something is pretty pretty agrigious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (4297/ 10720) 
ev all focus changes it really does 

Recording: (4298/ 10720)

Recording: (4698/ 10720) 
that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their per is opinions because i i for one example the pokimon craze my son did not know what pokimon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know

Recording: (4706/ 10720) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepare it for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (4707/ 10720) 
you know and i just thought i just do not i just do not like this is not s is this something that when i look a long terms of something that i want to deal with for the rest of my life and unch in know it just does ot you know and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible with somebody before you know people get into situations and they marry people that you jus you from the outside you can look and you can think are you not you know that is never going to wear <laugh> you know so i think that you just going nto have to take into consideration you know are you compattible do you really feel like this is something that is going to that is going to work and be positive 

Recording: (4708/ 10720) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (4709/ 10720) 
i i i would find that hard to believe <laugh> 

Recording: (4710/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4711/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4712/ 10720) 
i would say of uh i think the the the vv a generally sees on the average five seven ten something like that a day i a not all of them homeless 

Recording: (4713/ 10720)

Recording: (4714/ 10720) 
she said that it is like i d know some people wharre work there like i could not imagine working ke complete nights you know i mean i like working two thirty two eleven i think i would rather work like may be like noon to eight that would be better because then it is like i mean i am more ton to staying up late anyway it is just because if i like hoitis or whatever but like i do not want to have to get up really early either like i could never imagine have a a nine to five job like that would be horrible 

Recording: (4715/ 10720)

Recording: (4722/ 10720) 
to the other side 

Recording: (4723/ 10720)

Recording: (4792/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (4793/ 10720) 
so she is doing that and uh

yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4795/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (4796/ 10720) 
and i do think there is some and i do not thinku they would probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they would probably be exposed to you know the gay las being i i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth you know about sex and yor sexed classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i do not know our friends that have a eleven year old that is going to public schools i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (4797/ 10720)

Recording: (4803/ 10720)

Recording: (4824/ 10720) 
they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if if if a kid has bad behavior or you know bad attendenc that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shop lifting boing you know a hot wiring

Recording: (5207/ 10720) 
it was mostly cokasian and very few asian and other ethnicities 

Recording: (5208/ 10720) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh jon kennedy died 

Recording: (5209/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5210/ 10720) 
it was like u give them a license to be a screw up you know uh a lot of the nurses even who were former attics you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they were not doing fallowing protocall and of course me i would be the ones saying hey you are not falling protocall and they would say well you know i am i am a former attic i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (5211/ 10720) 
yah 

Recording: (5212/ 10720) 
i think that basically that is atn the nut shews they have reached a point in their life where you know the they are cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want tor kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death ore uh smoking you knowr whatever you know smoking uh pr crack or whatever and uh mhean just living in a hell i mean 

Recording: (5213/ 10720) 
yeah exactly and it is just uh it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are not placed now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (5214/ 10720) 
it is difficult you feel aloane a lot of the time uh and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh it i think with age i gets tempered ia little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it uh you know it does not matter who i vote for they are going ta lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was intereng my our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed t

Recording: (5220/ 10720) 
i is just a rule 

Recording: (5221/ 10720) 
right oh and i a and i am sure it will especially when you already recognize that you know that if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you are going to be helping along it is a lot easier than trying to figure otl what is going on here you know

Recording: (5259/ 10720) 
fromwhere 

Recording: (5260/ 10720) 
i really do not think we do for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occurd just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i do not really see too many sexas problems i definitely do see guys still being 

Recording: (5261/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5262/ 10720)

there is nothere is no there is no concept behind it <laugh> you are right you are right to some degree the um area commissions are supposed to work on that an help unifi i i used to be on the university area commission in in the campus area and that is one of the things we work on although we some of the other commissions in collumbus are almost strictly arkitectural they o only talk about 

Recording: (5271/ 10720) 
so made me squirm a little it always in my seat that happened i was kind of like i know who he is talking to <laugh> my my mother is two sisters married southern baptist ministers 

Recording: (5272/ 10720) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5273/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5274/ 10720) 
so i can sleep in and 

Recording: (5275/ 10720) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with ta with a bigger city when you get more people are is obviously going to be some more problems um i i mean that is really that is really all that i know itis it is obviously a lot more bulled up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (5276/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (5277/ 10720) 
and you learn what you have to to get through the test of course i did thatt when i was here at school 

Recording: (5278/ 10720) 
i did not like his last snowlan 

Recording: (5279/ 10720) 
and obviously a lot more dangerous and i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like college or whatever 

Recording: (5280/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (5281/ 10720) 
there was a littlewell quite a bit of it was yeah some of the people in the group did not play sports but it was not all from one sport or another it was football resstlers it was usually like the best football players the best restllers

Recording: (5289/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (5290/ 10720) 
against thim in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5291/ 10720) 
yeah they went and won the super bole and they went back and lost the super bole so 

Recording: (5292/ 10720) 
that was always too subjective for me 

Recording: (5293/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (5294/ 10720) 
i was going to see most of them are 

Recording: (5295/ 10720) 
for the rest of my life a and sobiat you know i got a conciance and uh and people that are honest and have a concience are dangerous out there but that is you know it is basically where i have been you know um i have lived heren my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball um due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i just i was very i was procaliber you know um i h played baseball with uh with pollo nel and 

Recording: (5296/ 10720)

leave the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew is baptisom and my grandparent is funeral and that is the only time hou will find me in there you know i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because uh the way i follow now and uw and actually seeing things for what they are and it is frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that is okay umthe law suit uh 

Recording: (5298/ 10720) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5299/ 10720) 
in his own mind regardless it is part of that bad spirit that people have created not the devil not saton to te native people he does not exist and to me he does not exist he is a pishit but he is real 

Recording: (5300/ 10720) 
um either lpinme 

Recording: (5301/ 10720) 
<laugh> you know i like you kno that the hey ave the i typical american tourist 

Recording: (5302/ 10720) 
she did but we were out 

Recording: (5303/ 10720) 
and um i do not know i think having just having the word onnors gives it some kids enough prestige that they do not totally freak out about not going ivy leage 

Recording: (5304/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5305/ 10720) 
uld make any difference or not 

Recording: (5306/ 10720) 
not too far from here 

Recording: (5307/ 10720) 
really i have not noticed that yet hum 

Recording: (5308/ 10720) 
because it was also a nice like a hundred or such a pretty round number 

Recording: (5309/ 10720) 
probably it is yeu are right i i asked him what language did he have to learn to g 

Recording: (5310/ 10720) 
t then when i found out there ware so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech theirpy as a very good background for eld because a lot of these lld kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper where they do not process things correctly auditorially so that is the perfect background to work with lld kidsd i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (5311/ 10720) 
but and it is it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents fore each individual child they have to all forme together as a group and almost be uh parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it actcess is the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even na were they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (5312/ 10720) 
ou know and they work hard you know to make it easier on the students you know they totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (5313/ 10720) 
w all of that plus by the time you get the first grad you ar suppsed to have but oh the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them in order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you tno know the numbers one through a hundred you are supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (5314/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5315/ 10720) 
well i would say in springfieled yeah 

Recording: (5316/ 10720) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bonds and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody got mad at somebody you know you they might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred into some people for no reason 

Recording: (5317/ 10720) 
so family um familiarity and um just a community i think crime i think is going up ben up um traffic as sarandas with the one but i mean you need to go through that right now because collumbas is expending so much that we need the 

Recording: (5318/ 10720) 
yeah <laugh> wo and um um you know at the time i was like i am not going to get anything out of this and it was mysery and u what not but i have met people that have been in much worse situations and at least i can kind of relate to them

Recording: (5321/ 10720) 
to melt and soften the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire that you have ever touched or been around and that far is sacred it is a sacred fire um so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down

Recording: (5403/ 10720) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (5404/ 10720) 
there were things out but there is nothing like what they have today you know small little hand guns and things like that that are real easy carriable and conceilable i mean like you know back in the sixtiesa stuff like that i mean they had switch blades things like that i mean i mean there is really nothing too different

um-hum 

Recording: (5409/ 10720) 
but you can also you an also grow with respect you can work with he community and still gain a respect from community and you don to have allegence but you know now adays we do not hav any loyialty at all that is out the window u and that isw i fear the most you are saying ere not it yeah big deal you are ging outhere for what yu want well maybe some people ant will cost they dil anot service okay boom disposable that is a problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to commuteu

Recording: (5411/ 10720) 
oh yeah

yeah 

Recording: (5413/ 10720) 
most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yeah it cost more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail d not on the streets anymore so they do not have to catch them they do not have to process them eccetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really 

Recording: (5414/ 10720)

Recording: (5473/ 10720) 
yeah i mean but i mean we are not in a depression and and the you know the employment rate is fine and health cares we have got some improvements there and like i said that that is do t atis very nice you know but i just i mean so i midi not say he is done a a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we have wasted where we could have spent that money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5474/ 10720) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5475/ 10720)

um-hum 

Recording: (5484/ 10720) 
uhum 

Recording: (5485/ 10720) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well uh so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting them they obviously w know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (5486/ 10720) 
eighty eight so we we just had our eleventh weading anniversary yeah

without being with them 

Recording: (5488/ 10720) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only hafe to be able to dis use like you said it wal likea the necessities 

Recording: (5489/ 10720)

Recording: (7030/ 10720)

Recording: (7053/ 10720) 
no no it dos nt 

Recording: (7054/ 10720) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation you know mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously hisand he said his dad told him about condams you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus

like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i am o not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really despaerate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean i mean i it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (7089/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7090/ 10720) 
when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and as an under current it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abbortion is an a very divicive issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divides them you know definitively almost like in vietnam almost 

Recording: (7091/ 10720) 
i i knew that kindergarten because it is it is not required in the state of ohio anyway they really are not required to be in school or end roled in anything until they are sixt by september when i found that out it was like oh okay col you know can keep them home i mean he is he could probably go into the second grade i mean he is very bright he can read and rite and ad and he he you know he is so it is a challenge for me

Recording: (7928/ 10720) 
yeah it is a qualitative type analasis 

Recording: (7929/ 10720)

i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breede they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they it woul probably by because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still having always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talked to them and i talked to uh high school students ore even young college students 

Recording: (7940/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7941/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7942/ 10720) 
but i think it should be an option you know i am really you know for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a child it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it ultima ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every option available especially when you are young no girl should have to go through you know pregnancy and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know 

Recording: (7943/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7944/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7945/ 10720)

so 

Recording: (7949/ 10720) 
can i can feed them and i get them so that is how our life is mister mom 

Recording: (7950/ 10720) 
well my question is who is more important on a basketball team the five starers or the six man coming off the bench i ask you now who ask george reas is he more is he less important this year than he was last year 

Recording: (7951/ 10720) 
now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (7952/ 10720) 
yeah so yeah and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (7953/ 10720) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7954/ 10720) 
e could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (7955/ 10720) 
eah my favorite character on that show had always been checote and i do not like how i do not like how his character has been portrayed in in the recent couple of seasons um i liked the fact that he was someone who had been a star fleat officer an but because of a matter of principle uh left star fleeat joind the maki but was still uh fundamentally an honerable person 

Recording: (7956/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (7957/ 10720) 
no um what what really um when aid star i had a of one of my best friends brother had died of it and that and that really after that i like you know was like i have to work on thmbecause i was scared to death to get aids you know so i did work on hems you know probably after a few years of having sects without contoms but 

Recording: (7958/ 10720) 
to be something that is going to make them change you know what is it you know what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different then you know the government saying okay this is your cut off lement but i mean the statistics they 

Recording: (7959/ 10720) 
ell yeah me either 

Recording: (7960/ 10720) 
convenient <laugh> 

Recording: (7961/ 10720) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (7962/ 10720) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (7963/ 10720) 
uh y ma 

Recording: (7964/ 10720) 
se i am i am a i am a i am a professor i am doing studies here and uh 

Recording: (7965/ 10720) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up with as iwas but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (7966/ 10720) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed from things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is living uh basically as today as ther future where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow 

Recording: (7967/ 10720) 
like i do not know it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (7968/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (7969/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (7970/ 10720) 
okay it does not hoave like the equalizer thingy 

Recording: (7971/ 10720) 
lbuy yoursel 

Recording: (7972/ 10720) 
i think i would say the same thing because um course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness and um 

Recording: (7973/ 10720) 
if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know wht i mean kind of 

Recording: (7974/ 10720) 
e 

Recording: (7975/ 10720) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (7976/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7977/ 10720) 
just i ave wante i just go back and topic out something she said uh picking up hat b picking up that child and cuddling it and and having having that baby touch your skin uh and uh h teaching how what love is uh u you do not necessarily teach love by words but itit just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother the little brother and 

Recording: (7978/ 10720) 
el i think that is good 

Recording: (7979/ 10720) 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you are going to tell me that fog pushed that two foot pine tree across the way i mean it was a thick tree too <laugh> and uh we get up to the next gas station heat fills up andi listen on the intercom they had news on their weather and stuff tornado warning in that countyd i turn around in said no ill see who is the 

Recording: (7980/ 10720) 
i can see that i you know like i said for me i kind of i kind of stay where i am so it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more so i mean it does not really affect me personally maybe that is bad i do not know mea sy i woud feel guilty about that but 

Recording: (7981/ 10720) 
you know will we will take that as an insult 

Recording: (7982/ 10720) 
i do not even know what to say whauld a disgrace <laugh> it i just embarrasce thy o get realy 

Recording: (7983/ 10720) 
i think of it is a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which have also been to of course 

Recording: (7984/ 10720) 
made to face their um their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardend criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (7985/ 10720) 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh the i i have not went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that bige thing except for the influx of the you know i didveot realize how many were being drafted ore being inlisting to the service at the time and everything or how many actually we are even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (7986/ 10720) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were gong ta buy a houseand clinten vill to hold them and rent them my problem is i do not have any money so i that down payment adit has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple o condos over on bethel road for my kids to live in so my oldest girl when she was goting ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so 

Recording: (7987/ 10720) 
ell they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they um try to intervene with their family and put them back with their family or um maybe call in childreni services and and i just really do not think much of childreni services so 

Recording: (7988/ 10720) 
and i mean yeah they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact ofte matter is it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (7989/ 10720) 
ve to get them thinking about itnd then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (7990/ 10720)

Recording: (8044/ 10720) 
and so it became uh a part of everyday life an and the more you see something the more it be becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having ando in fact maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of sterio typical um but i am sure it does have uh some influence because it i think it did it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces 

Recording: (8045/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8046/ 10720) 
um to move forward in my life now what would happen with the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that worked for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to installed or supposed to have installed that was five feet higher three to five feet higher and uh choulda would av cout a you know if it

Recording: (8049/ 10720) 
um like i said it would just to be the old generations with the black precident where now it would be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that would be a bigger number

Recording: (8132/ 10720) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way it does not mean it is the right way and um i yeah i you know i really strugle with that because i come more from i think the famili should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going no do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um <laugh> sounod like my dad bt it seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids 

Recording: (8133/ 10720) 
t be really rouid not helpful 

Recording: (8134/ 10720) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good day care because theyt work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before you was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or sumit in a church when it first started but ou know it is just not you know people were always saying i can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to 

Recording: (8135/ 10720)

once you are in it you areua been in it and that is it i have thirty two points 

Recording: (8137/ 10720) 
far a little bit much much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me just all the sorts of changes and it is like things like that going on but other than that i mean i seem to like it i mean it is definitely changes for the better it is a lot more just free i mean to get to do whatever you want i mean there is no one watching noveresaying what you have to do all the time and everything like that 

Recording: (8138/ 10720) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they wil not allow dogs so she is not allowed to go over there bso she is always a bu but it does make a big difference so i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8139/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (8140/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8141/ 10720)

yeah well there was not even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways te say it the just there was nothing there there w is no ability communicate there was uh he needs to know this piece of information and at the same time bt there is no way i cauld tell it to him so yeah s like so so i am yeah you do not know and there is nothing lse to do about it and continue on marylay and he i i he said eventually he said it was some time later when i actually found out is going on he said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party accountant can figure out who is not there and i sum something bad has happened but um but he said but it was a while before 

Recording: (8144/ 10720) 
uum 

Recording: (8145/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8146/ 10720)

Recording: (8148/ 10720) 
much in school with that 

Recording: (8149/ 10720) 
as to what the sangtuary should be like <laugh> <laugh> so we had a tour uh the quire took a toure our quire director um arranged it to about sixo five or six churches in the collumbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we liked the accousticks of and uh that was interesting we sang and uh we sang in the central presbatarian church 

Recording: (8150/ 10720)

Recording: (8159/ 10720) 
n that that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people goo nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game

<laugh> 

Recording: (8163/ 10720) 
hen dad did no even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with the parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being um shown and and have access to 

Recording: (8164/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (8165/ 10720) 
plus what the intornat and everything they they have access to so much information i think that it falls back on the parents still bcaufe you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (8166/ 10720) 
i said well we you have to take a forrign language you hav t i said look i am not taking any more forein languages we are going to figure out how to avoid this or no you have to take ia i said look lady there are sixty thousand students in this university and if you think that i am going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the college of forreign language you are insane there is another way to do this experience what is it well you have to take a forreign languaged i said okay we aregong to change the question a litebadgy here you have two options now tell me how to avoid taking a forein language or tell me how to talk to somebody who is nat you because that is apparently all

Recording: (9023/ 10720) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good said i my my best friend is the relder o she is since retired but it is so funny because she would always go through all these statistics and this and that because the stuff i have done is in and and because i live in area and so she would say oh i do not know and she said well how much do you have to get at for and how much and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under a hired and five i oud probably can sell i for a hired and forty if i do thisissistanince now you ae gono put a lot of money into that though it is not like you are you are still oin get

gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (9027/ 10720) 
ohuh that is neace 

Recording: (9028/ 10720) 
i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know well 

Recording: (9029/ 10720) 
well because i have been in public schools all my life and i should bet first to know that there is ah lot of favoritisem you know some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other 

Recording: (9030/ 10720) 
the arts it was called <laugh> and that was interesting it was those are it is kind of an under class of teachers they do not pay you k enough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty 

Recording: (9031/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9032/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (9033/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (9034/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9035/ 10720) 
o 

Recording: (9036/ 10720) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like where they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have as take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up and i do not know what i grew up in but i wil i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens 

Recording: (9037/ 10720) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9038/ 10720) 
yeah but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother is name was harriet 

Recording: (9039/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9040/ 10720) 
yes but there is nobody at home but my sister and i so a domestic vi sort of been a curious affair so i just figured something weird is going on i did not know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce related and just basically dum because the divorce was not going to fase me because the entire marrage was we knew we knew from the begining that it was a dum idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so we are just kind of waiting around and going a e are going to be divorced it a couple of months and sure enough i is rt any mike um so i i looked at these people on their names are thoug 

Recording: (9041/ 10720) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people the pet say but it is just i could not be around that and and you know i would go off on people that would do that bring thit in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth sometimes uh i am not a violent man either even as big as you know so 

Recording: (9042/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9043/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9044/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9045/ 10720) 
um i do soe mut just not a one of them i just got back from lunch with i mean i see them 

Recording: (9046/ 10720) 
where they are almost segragating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segragating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or what not u and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (9047/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9048/ 10720) 
right yeah youa well you you can not even put a price on it either so it is 

Recording: (9049/ 10720) 
in a hold and i was still uh shaken but uh and i do not remember i think they put one of our guns out of commission that time but they did not do as much damage as they might have 

Recording: (9050/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9051/ 10720) 
ye 

Recording: (9052/ 10720)

Recording: (9065/ 10720) 
no no in fact the principal when she interviewed me asked me that and i said when we are raised in the unitarian sunday school it is uh it is almost an indoctrination in tolerance for other religions <laugh> so you are better off with me than somebody that believes theirs is the only one true religion

en car paper so when you wihte on the white copy it comes through on to the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend so he did not have to write you know if he was not getting the notes 

Recording: (9072/ 10720) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (9073/ 10720) 
do all of the stuff and then you you know pretend that you are a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case butan going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me i sey my family my mom and dad um well i um my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungry and that was a neat experience i liked growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a pesant in hungry uh and he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do 

Recording: (9074/ 10720) 
value and why are you doing this to my kid uh so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools uh so it is just seems to be more distraction fror the educational process you i mean when you are in the kaythlice school and you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to of course part of the way they deal with it is they take the real problem send them over back to the public schools uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it 

Recording: (9075/ 10720)

as he was speaking and and as he s tarted tos speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous inmpression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are s because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries ind us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (9598/ 10720)

it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i will be gone by the time it is non if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for a small school and they just open up with their pghd program ind education and they are also nowng for political science but it is a real conservative political science andike it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views

<laugh> 

Recording: (9778/ 10720) 
made you well aware of 

Recording: (9779/ 10720)

Recording: (9785/ 10720) 
you know compared to any other citiyes of course i am i loved orregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (9786/ 10720) 
they are all at day care r thr you know n they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the day care so 

Recording: (9787/ 10720) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9788/ 10720) 
i mean we went in there one day and you know i explained the whole thing to her and then she puts off some kind of excuse the administrator she says well we do not need problem students like yourself lablabla i said what problem 

Recording: (9789/ 10720)

Recording: (9790/ 10720) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else it s just suits me fine 

Recording: (9791/ 10720) 
i mean they they went to the poles and droves you did not have to you know the the the hope there was that they would not go to vote <laugh> <laugh> on the school levie uh but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (9792/ 10720)

and parting sound pretty good so 

Recording: (9801/ 10720) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i hoad gotten from the bord of elections earlier and compared it with my list of

Recording: (9828/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9829/ 10720) 
you know my older sister wis a different case she is a little batter but it it is you know as long as you have a good parent it you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father she she did very well

i think that the 

Recording: (9837/ 10720) 
the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just bul them somewhere and in fo but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you i you would kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and you know it woull be interestingoh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that um you know if they are if they are caught um innd it is any kind 

Recording: (9838/ 10720) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for 

Recording: (9839/ 10720)

Recording: (9840/ 10720) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attenntio and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is it is really he he nurchers him too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (9841/ 10720)

Recording: (9847/ 10720) 
she just used the word penalty uh penalty has lots of different definitions each individual has a mental picture what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences i i want to take just and o say penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the riht or to the left let us come back to about the middle i am

yeah 

Recording: (9849/ 10720) 
okay i 

Recording: (9850/ 10720) 
and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god and believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is very the very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this like yhou said me me me and ie got to have this and that status symble stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in

yeah that that is one of the drawbaks <laugh> 

Recording: (10278/ 10720) 
if not you just get there the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and this and that but when you obviously go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (10279/ 10720) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know <laugh> 

Recording: (10280/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (10281/ 10720) 
just because you know it was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the text book they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have theiro knots like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um and so i think it it is when people have real enthusiasum and like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not the 

Recording: (10282/ 10720)
