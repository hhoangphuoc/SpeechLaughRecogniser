yeah i  i you know i think too i appologize to my oldest daughter amost every day about the por thing all i put her through wa we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born an so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable over what they can do because if they are really verbal my kids always have been really verbale because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even what you know when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole ime obviusly 

Recording: (21/ 10720) 
on the spir of the moment i woud t have to think about that i really would

Recording: (23/ 10720)

Recording: (24/ 10720) 
ecause you know the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and you know at least to day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it is not game game it it has a game theame to it but 

Recording: (25/ 10720) 
where animals everyone is looking for leaders it is ae rule os the church  simple as a rule 

Recording: (26/ 10720) 
but now it seems like people are just like i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said uh he grew up in the bronks 

Recording: (27/ 10720) 
i think that is kind of where i am coming from jan and i know you i jan i mean what my sister does i just say to her i just really admire it i can not give as much as she gives ik i just do not have that same spirit she has but uh it is great to see i mean she is real she really when she is with the people i do not know i have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and 

Recording: (28/ 10720) 
i am the oldest 

Recording: (29/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (30/ 10720)

Recording: (33/ 10720)

Recording: (34/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (35/ 10720) 
no with the system 

Recording: (36/ 10720) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just somethingan i do not want to deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean t people of the same sex are living together or married or whatnot  that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that u 

Recording: (37/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (38/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (39/ 10720)

i mean theye are people whot think cars will notn 

Recording: (49/ 10720) 
and of course that never happened 

Recording: (50/ 10720) 
it is all up to a human being if they want ta change if they got their minds set on they do not want to be with the you know their other sex i do not think yu can change them you know that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (51/ 10720) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about whas the and when he wis fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finished school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money and i mean we do not need to have a tun but we just should be at least a little out of det  yeah something 

Recording: (52/ 10720) 
yeah i know oh it givs me gos bumps it is such a shame 

Recording: (53/ 10720) 
something like that i do not i do not know much about it 

Recording: (54/ 10720) 
and i is if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebell 

Recording: (55/ 10720) 
with that situation 

Recording: (56/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (57/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (58/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (59/ 10720) 
you know i was sitting down uh in my boy friend is room and my room mate was sitting up in my room alone i had my computer on but nobody was sitting at it 

Recording: (60/ 10720) 
so i you know they pile ey you resemble that remarker you know 

Recording: (61/ 10720) 
for me to even think abut 

Recording: (62/ 10720) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like about black ass and all this you know they are prejudiced and all she is doing is yelling about being their prejudence against her because   what she do not understand that is her dam job 

Recording: (63/ 10720) 
yes 

Recording: (64/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (65/ 10720) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time where we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both  the world so 

Recording: (66/ 10720) 
except for their names wore changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (67/ 10720) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special i sertificute you are csertified kindergarten through twelfeth so i did several years in the high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary while my kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that 

Recording: (68/ 10720) 
they have always been there i mean you know  i do not really care what the uh guy is specific thing is if he is in a fox hole with me you know and as long as he can shoot a gun uh  you know i mean i cod carel i have got gay friends you know so 

Recording: (69/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (70/ 10720) 
uum 

Recording: (71/ 10720) 
it really is not i it really is great 

Recording: (72/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (73/ 10720) 
they will be naked but they will still go in with a huge tal on 

Recording: (74/ 10720) 
i mean uh like uh what is his name though who wrote the book you  just 

Recording: (75/ 10720) 
hich could change 

Recording: (76/ 10720) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (77/ 10720) 
i have not taken him there yet 

Recording: (78/ 10720) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation or that you can be converted to homosexualidy and i personally do not believe that so it uh you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this co comes from but since i think they are wrong i 

Recording: (79/ 10720) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person youo just have a different way of going about it  probably 

Recording: (80/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (81/ 10720) 
but i am using me ans a example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me rong 

Recording: (82/ 10720) 
yeah he i 

Recording: (83/ 10720) 
i just did not want to do that a lot of people do that but you know it is just such an investment then when you leave and 

Recording: (84/ 10720) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i  i do not even know because to it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together that has to work it is going tao be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about ealion this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is the 

Recording: (85/ 10720) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (86/ 10720) 
her house in india is like this mantion and they have servants there i mean it is really impressive just the houses are just worth more so you can not get as much house here but yeah everybody is doing well 

Recording: (87/ 10720) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (88/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (89/ 10720) 
that is fine 

Recording: (90/ 10720) 
riht 

Recording: (91/ 10720) 
not as an individual uh well see that is a problem i have it is hard to find a balance between sensorship and you know free flow of information uh and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running which i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while w tit it it is kind of interesting to watch these people uh but 

Recording: (92/ 10720) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (93/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (94/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 10720) 
yeah is ik keep it was not but then a moves well there we go 

Recording: (96/ 10720) 
but you do not really have to work as are there apparently 

Recording: (97/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (98/ 10720) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes theme different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look at like well moy of my friends have to do nd say why i knowwh i have to do it you know they look at it like it is a big pain because thiy got it run over to the nurse and 

Recording: (99/ 10720) 
you do not you do not use cupons 

Recording: (100/ 10720) 
and aparently that is a way of enissuing ana conversation uh one of the guys i usually go clubbing with he is goine to got me in to the low stick dancing and he said uh  he sayd thate is like a signe tit says come hit on me and i am like oh great that is that is just what i need and that does not bother me hat not bother me i just i jus i sort of just i am jut like o you know i am straight if they start if they start getting really you know really pushyi about it i am just like i am straiht but a lot of times it is really funny because i will get ing the conversation with them and they will bel like you are straight are not you i am like yat 

Recording: (101/ 10720) 
and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were ieming each other and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that they 

Recording: (102/ 10720) 
uhi blew a disk out 

Recording: (103/ 10720) 
oh not very right o and i twenty twenty years first twenty years i worked at the buro i was worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they are misinterpreted and my wife as  has been a director of institutional research at the university uh at data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there uh 

Recording: (104/ 10720)

Recording: (111/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (112/ 10720) 
an go ahead and say well now sometimes she will askd sometimes she does but let us assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and so forth she puts them right in there and that is think uh with those other dishes makes no efferts to clean them ad and i i i have seen this and many many many incidents but i am agrebing you this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society 

Recording: (113/ 10720) 
i ways thinking of grandchildren 

Recording: (114/ 10720) 
i think he is in prison and um he has no driver is license privileges for life and you know it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff

it  right 

Recording: (120/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (121/ 10720) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (122/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (123/ 10720) 
and but enu know that dherin goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean if obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs ind the basement to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his nervana or whatever you know and uh and his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (124/ 10720) 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um uh i think there is something else in the bible where you know she the he lady gives givs only a small portion compared to a large portion but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need do promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialize we need to think more of that but i think it s realy take home at night what would you bou doing if your third world country did not have a choice 

Recording: (125/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (126/ 10720) 
all right now  kind of job motivated 

Recording: (127/ 10720) 
stattis 

Recording: (128/ 10720) 
uh it is 

Recording: (129/ 10720) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had epoleptsy they would lock you in ha closet and thog wa the key and whed and let you out most of the parents i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids with a stepparen

yeah 

Recording: (134/ 10720)

Recording: (135/ 10720)

Recording: (136/ 10720) 
and  ithink there as an article this last wensday in the dispach and business section as to how the pstl can not regulate i and because that they want to de regullate tella communicationss uh and so for the past months we have not been getting telvon bills for usage we had the backbone we are paying for  mand what is going to happen ow this whole thing is hit offers us a a a lot of lato where with uh we can now uh if we have a contractor let us say over 

Recording: (137/ 10720)

Recording: (197/ 10720) 
like pidgins okay 

Recording: (198/ 10720) 
what the question really says instead of what he thinks it says so that you will not be testing his reading hability but you will really be testing whether he knows about magnitism 

Recording: (199/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (200/ 10720) 
e 

Recording: (201/ 10720) 
i think it is because parents are at work and they are busy making money and they are not teaching their kids any i mean they are not teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal you know um thanks for having me when you go to someone is house but just the normal i can not tllyou how many kids ihve picked up and driven home when i picked up my son because it was raining or something and they just jump out of the car and go buy slam the door i turned to my son and i go do not you ever do that to someone is mother now how bad 

Recording: (202/ 10720) 
is these uh theat has a set up where um they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (203/ 10720) 
i mean you do not know anything behind it or what is going into it why would you do something like that 

Recording: (204/ 10720) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (205/ 10720) 
so we have a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (206/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (207/ 10720) 
the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents uh my momo gave you a first hand example uh i just had a uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandpaw is house and she will come in and she will flop down in a chaire uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it 

Recording: (208/ 10720)

Recording: (212/ 10720) 
uh too ta we never used the word ever  but um i am sure pulyan people use the word on us you know but we we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but um in 

Recording: (213/ 10720) 
oh yeah we are members of that 

Recording: (214/ 10720) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (215/ 10720) 
w nothing about it or if they did they did not even think anything about it and i do not think that behavior it is uh appropriate for a sixteen seventeen year old kidhum 

Recording: (216/ 10720) 
it is a little hard to accept uh you know an i its it is hard to know what he is going through how much of it is uh normal teenage rebellion and how much of it is just 

Recording: (217/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (218/ 10720) 
i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (219/ 10720) 
but i mean that is just sort of the carious nature of kids i mean they obviously they were going to get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parent is faught i mean ane there are a lot of people i mean i think just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting that happed a couple of yers ago and they just came to a verdict on it and the parent like left it in a top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the kee was he climed up on a ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it 

Recording: (220/ 10720) 
it took us ten years to have and i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the suttle oudertone undertones you know is she or is not she it was just like well i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that that was an ono to her but i was not but she did not evn to know the

so they get more buying power if they go there okay 

Recording: (222/ 10720) 
and you knotics how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now an then um i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to the catholic church for example they can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attractive and they do every every religion makes it more attractive for it ohs ou are  what a comefrom wolh yeah but the bom line is

Recording: (225/ 10720) 
of a particular uh facility voice end data 

Recording: (226/ 10720) 
uh i am originally from indiana but i lived up in uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleaveland center which is an air root traffic control center and i moved from there to ohio state airport and i worked there for nineteen years and uh then i transferred to port collumbus

yeah we um we have two computers in our house and they both have internet on them and um th it is called all advantage and they will pay you to go to weabsites and i is like twenty five cent an hour or something i do not remember what it was but we have not got a check yet but

Recording: (231/ 10720) 
it at ten oclock in the morning i do not care and there is no compromise with himyu 

Recording: (232/ 10720) 
yeah they are very quantitative as upposed to like the quality and then so the analesis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that is what i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i cannot stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well tel in in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turn over things like that then and if you have a product a 

Recording: (233/ 10720)

Recording: (251/ 10720) 
absolutely 

Recording: (252/ 10720) 
that is it 

Recording: (253/ 10720) 
umhum right 

Recording: (254/ 10720) 
umm 

Recording: (255/ 10720) 
ou know that is a possibility you do not you you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you because you know the the word has to get out that we do not have that much money  it does not pay yeah 

Recording: (256/ 10720) 
or likea summer project or something 

Recording: (257/ 10720) 
so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figur tht woul be a decent i mean it translates over because we are in sammasters it will get all messed up there but it it is it is like i am halfway to three fourths done with the with my degree so if i wantet ta transfer now it would be like because i after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the creditswil not transfer over be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half 

Recording: (258/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (259/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (260/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (261/ 10720) 
no 

Recording: (262/ 10720) 
even in the package of informatiion 

Recording: (263/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (264/ 10720) 
but i have been in situations where people have told races jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny pleas do not tell them any more in my presence you do what you want when you are with your other friends but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blond jokes i find those sexsest an racest in a way and i i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working in in an office tha 

Recording: (265/ 10720) 
umhm 

Recording: (266/ 10720) 
people want a number they do not want to know the methodology that goes into i or the the disclaimers or the footnotes they do not want to read the footnotes they want a number uh when i worked for the state one program i worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh number as employes by different occupations in different industries in different areas of ohio uh which actually u originally started here at the university in ohio was a federal program department labor it was dministered to state level and 

Recording: (267/ 10720) 
white women who wad actually had it done thn uh h then um hispanic or affrican american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is it is not so much money that it would radically change your life in a sort of 

Recording: (268/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (269/ 10720) 
it is up to him to resolve it 

Recording: (270/ 10720) 
but she does not believe it yeah yeah she is very pragmaticuhm yeah sh yeam she could probably 

Recording: (271/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (272/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (273/ 10720) 
if you have specific questions we are never going to get to them 

Recording: (274/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (275/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (276/ 10720) 
uh lik because there is not like uh like a like a defined lead lead person because e s just one person doing itn most of tnd most of the time i mean like people do have groups that play like technobt or in music but it is not like a lead singer who like you know it is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (277/ 10720) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to doi mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maveric i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traft orr who could not you would be a millionar because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factors i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then thee other people uh 

Recording: (278/ 10720) 
like you are doing interviews 

Recording: (279/ 10720) 
so um national amerit scolars also get full ind state tuition 

Recording: (280/ 10720)

Recording: (282/ 10720) 
yeah i will yeah i will explain that to thim 

Recording: (283/ 10720)

Recording: (284/ 10720) 
yeah the media exposure 

Recording: (285/ 10720)

cumula nimvus or whatever you know and uh you know he is pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because uh  i was right 

Recording: (296/ 10720) 
they get caught with that stuff or him and nothing happens and it is just su such a horrible example that here you have got you know some regular some eighteen year old kid that does something really stupid and he is ten years in jail and then you have got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can you elected wen you get out wa you just it is just it is som it is just ay wrog 

Recording: (297/ 10720) 
to come in and  kape with our neighbors like years ago you knew everybody in in town well the town i grew up in was summer station and i do ot knowif you re that litle tinim inyou town or not but it is not a very big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (298/ 10720) 
hi jonny bybye 

Recording: (299/ 10720) 
and then it is different businesses like white cassle or pizah one of the pisa places and uh some of the super markets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to huckleberry house and they do not have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know a group of volunteers that go out and pick these kids up take them to huckleberry house which

they uh i said i did not belong to any groups and that is not true i belong to ahio desighner craftsmen and um uh they in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio artists but the membership is is national so uh it is not it is not really closed it is just sort of focusing on ohio

well there were five of us and a lot of that 

Recording: (312/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (313/ 10720) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through som sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of beging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is a really easy life 

Recording: (314/ 10720) 
uh but see his father lived right around e corner and never even had nothing to do with them

i do not think it is really i do not think it is really affected me ith i mean obviously there is amate or places to go shopping or to eat orou there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (533/ 10720)

Recording: (556/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (557/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (558/ 10720) 
and as more and more people are getting older and older there will be more of needs for it maybe a lot of things there is going to be more need for as people get older 

Recording: (559/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (560/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (561/ 10720) 
and it is not our generation who is curtailing it it is still the uh like our parents generation um 

Recording: (562/ 10720) 
ll as it turned out he expected us to play the solos  but i we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and um i thought it came out pretty well ii have it recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset 

Recording: (563/ 10720) 
i think what them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and you know look all over the place for different e you look on the screen it is different you say well i would have done this in asnis but you know down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this you know 

Recording: (564/ 10720) 
heyave 

Recording: (565/ 10720) 
i just actually i was going to send my son to a christian kindergarten but i decided the home school instead so i hald been home schooling and for kindergarten 

Recording: (566/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (567/ 10720) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (568/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (569/ 10720) 
yeah right yeah we could put a little trailer there we would be outside most of the time anyway so 

Recording: (570/ 10720) 
um yeh people that live there i mean we have got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and and couple of asian groceries but i you know i i i do not know where they live  i mean it it seems it seems like for those stores to be opening there there must be somewhere in clintainville but i do not i do not know 

Recording: (571/ 10720) 
i did i did my bitching but really was not nothing to do about it because you know once they have their word in it they are 

Recording: (572/ 10720) 
that is not my favorite age i guess 

Recording: (573/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (574/ 10720) 
i was taking like you know twenty one twenty three hours a quarder so 

Recording: (575/ 10720) 
and they do not know any diferenc 

Recording: (576/ 10720) 
umhumi did i 

Recording: (577/ 10720) 
yeah they are okay they are parents they are in their seventies now i i take what i need and leave the rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (578/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (579/ 10720) 
yeah it is really expensive but that is why i went there for now i would not go there it was actually my last choice uh for universities but i went there because of the price 

Recording: (580/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (581/ 10720) 
i think that i i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinating things and i know that sounds kind of petty but just um i i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you couldn find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (582/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (583/ 10720) 
yeah  the happy undion of it homrehands

but people coming from other cities like chicago new york you know in places like that where they were treated poorly by whites you know they um they tended to act differently towards you and everything un to they realized that you were not liked tat you know uh we only had one racial incident when i was in the service uh where it was we were predominantly white uh patoon in uhbecause we worked in missels and stuff you know so 

Recording: (589/ 10720)

Recording: (590/ 10720) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised um which class was this in i think this was inh that ntroduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard  and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty not at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight ay average at this school before my class and i was giving her a be and she was her 

Recording: (591/ 10720) 
for fun we have been playing a lot of pool 

Recording: (592/ 10720) 
neither one of us can remember it so i d n 

Recording: (593/ 10720) 
because they have done away with uuh civil service step raisers which were wrong because i could have done a crumby job and got the same raise as doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times given to raise is and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (594/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (595/ 10720)

Recording: (600/ 10720) 
and neither one of these folks could answer yes or now and they are going just answer yes or no that is ll all i think i staye od my point very clearly when i ws the answer is yes or was it was it was um health care for live ing partners um it is a simple question yes or now how do you stand on this issue and it just guys mea nats that you know and i know that that from a pir standpoint you do not want to you know want to shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like thet 

Recording: (601/ 10720) 
oh yeah umhum 

Recording: (602/ 10720) 
tra your trash i specking of what movies are playing uh but i do not really rely on heavenly for news 

Recording: (603/ 10720) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (604/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (605/ 10720) 
yes it is definitely have an effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i do not know but uh i am glad my children went to school when they did  and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (606/ 10720) 
right because everything that has a cupon has tons of fat tons of shugar and is over priced 

Recording: (607/ 10720) 
i talk to her everyday 

Recording: (608/ 10720) 
right my husband drops them off and i pick them up so he is there for the shortest amount of time 

Recording: (609/ 10720) 
yeah and we are one of them taxes is support and strong they have like 

Recording: (610/ 10720) 
more respectfully that toh you know i mean most the people will accept you if you are dressed in a dress where as i mean even in a person in a nose rang iwil will respect you but but then you are in a you are at a disadvantage if you do not  dress in a certain way 

Recording: (611/ 10720) 
put my hand here try to keep it out of the line of the wire 

Recording: (612/ 10720) 
i  i am n pressd i am like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look like anything

Recording: (615/ 10720) 
like anda of is all thers little words you are already supposed to know those you are supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it is just a little short sentence like my name is jo an i live at bububu street i mean it is incredible it is like the coriculum keeps moving down and down and down 

Recording: (616/ 10720)

Recording: (617/ 10720) 
well actually i have picked up a parttime job just in the past month or two so i am i am working for a research firm just for the convenience of the hours i i would want to go back into ta nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eight hour shift and uhi do not think that we are ready for that yethe is 

Recording: (618/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (619/ 10720) 
that and i i imagine that is about half and a half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is inevolution at this time tell you the truth what is going to cause the world to end i think what they really mean b by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content 

Recording: (620/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (621/ 10720) 
hm 

Recording: (622/ 10720) 
like a little coffey shop 

Recording: (623/ 10720) 
i am just kind of appalled  what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (624/ 10720) 
but uh but even so the uh we were on list and the germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us so we did not go out in the daylight hardly at all 

Recording: (625/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (626/ 10720) 
so hard i mean every summer they have home work that has to be done or else the first grading period is netef and when  my you nw oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching accademy there and once she got into it she went h maybe not  so i said well what you know whatever so then she wanted to go t because it is basically ah collumbus public school that sgere to college only i mean if if you are not going to college do not go there because you will flunk out it is very hard 

Recording: (627/ 10720) 
and i am meting with someone on thursday actually who is in that field and it is really just an open field 

Recording: (628/ 10720) 
that will just you know send me into the new molennium or whatever you want to call it 

Recording: (629/ 10720) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or you know something like that you call the contrarry i will be in thursday you know if your air conditions sof they are always going to have to have people here so i just feel they are either better to down scale the amount of people that have and get highly qualified people then have twenty people that half of them know what is going on half of them do not so but that is tough to do when you are starting people at eight dollars an hour and stuff so there is you know wendies mcdonnalds there iso places that you can make that money 

Recording: (630/ 10720) 
well uh the first h the first thing is clintonvill 

Recording: (631/ 10720) 
ee the oh reallyno they do not have like your your basic amenitiesh my gosh  really uhhuh where is

Recording: (633/ 10720) 
yeand o 

Recording: (634/ 10720) 
umum parties did not change at all 

Recording: (635/ 10720) 
uum 

Recording: (636/ 10720) 
gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh i know where yo are coming from and being confronted with that when i was a high estate and so forth and um so i just slated down the line to her 

Recording: (637/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (638/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (639/ 10720) 
i i have gone to one but i had a back problemand that is how dealt with it and it worked 

Recording: (640/ 10720) 
yeah high school a lot of people are really narrow minded and work on really trying to fit inad college people are more open like open minded and they are more willing to express their own ideas 

Recording: (641/ 10720) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (642/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (643/ 10720) 
i a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (644/ 10720) 
be back although now i miss lorndon so 

Recording: (645/ 10720) 
ol that is heyn 

Recording: (646/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (647/ 10720) 
the one that is eighteen now i thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four because his dad is left handed my sister is left handed i have one left handed parent well all of a sudden one day he picked up thing with he right hand nd he is been gt with his right hand ever since so you really can not tell because they they are pretty much either or until they are about five 

Recording: (648/ 10720) 
yeah which is good for me because i do not ever go there anyway so 

Recording: (649/ 10720) 
um i have a decota card it what it does is it k it decodes the dvd right away rather than sending it though the processor so it is it is a lot faster it does not depend on my process or time like it the movie does not skip or anything it just goes straight through um 

Recording: (650/ 10720) 
it is another thing that they are in their own in the house where the parents are every night and not going into the garage and finding things 

Recording: (651/ 10720) 
and uh then whinle she was out there she met a a cowboy who was from also from ohioa and uh they i they were married while they were out there i guess but uh she was   as my son used to say she was a piece of work she had 

Recording: (652/ 10720) 
ecause you e got to trust the people youare around you do not really want to pick them of 

Recording: (653/ 10720) 
so they are kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent anit is kind of how it is divided out between the projects 

Recording: (654/ 10720) 
really 

Recording: (655/ 10720) 
oing to jump up and start hollering about my faith um and and i will not i wil not walk into a coffey shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i do not feel i am ready to do that yet i think theye are  i think there is a place in the time for doing certain things like um and this is this is one of the biggest um things that people use as as a reason for faith 

Recording: (656/ 10720) 
i do not think we need eight months and we need to start the campain even a year before the primaries it is just too long uh people start tuning out and there is anlay so much you can say and tit is like the candidates 

Recording: (657/ 10720) 
yeah you areu yeah maybe right could be could be 

Recording: (658/ 10720) 
that is the optimisum yeah okay i have now dover and very what else do i need to remember 

Recording: (659/ 10720) 
not at all 

Recording: (660/ 10720) 
yeah i think it isf course we ware fiddling with that so much 

Recording: (661/ 10720) 
allright well i was born in collumbus i am twenty seven uh graduated from high estate 

Recording: (662/ 10720)

Recording: (664/ 10720) 
n give us a job sure 

Recording: (665/ 10720) 
or you can do for them uh and that all applies to the pelaraus question as i see it and i think also that uh  it is it is a very very major financial uh gain for the developers who are doing it and it is going to therefor harm uh the many many areas a s at s at affect ed such as north north north north north  what is the name of the shop uh north wa northrland 

Recording: (666/ 10720) 
yeah make their job earlier and faster uh you know in librarian librares like so many other places especially at universities are facing budget problems and and subscriptions forperiodicals are just outrageous 

Recording: (667/ 10720) 
with my mother umhum

i got a really high icue extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intelect i would go in nd take an exam bing bang go out geting a wive not even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did in my freshmen year for one mid term  or or one final and uh that just did not work when i got to college but i did not know that until i was done with my freshman year with a one point seven gpa buut uho see the middale winter qorder i 

Recording: (669/ 10720)

Recording: (687/ 10720) 
and the house smells wonderful you know it is like cakes uh birthday cakes you know i think but myh i think my wife was the last one i i make her one and you know we e straght off and i bought a uh uh what i sat betty crocker at odlots it was twenty two cents the icing was twenty two cents i made it and everybody goes tosa is really god it is like a sour cream icing i yeahand they go boy this is really gooda they go did you buy this and i go no i made it and they go really and i go yea it costs me forty four cents 

Recording: (688/ 10720) 
and uh so 

Recording: (689/ 10720) 
that is that is really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campain that she ran negatives do not work in columbus collumbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in columbus what plays in the state and tand the people who ran her campaign ran voinovitchis campaign and betty mountgomerie is campain and and that negative stuff worked state wide at does not work so well in columbus um i i think ii even a younger woman

no i mean the money you know the money is great you know fand it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the sighning bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janetor 

Recording: (765/ 10720) 
well yeah i could have just took thim out in the woods and whipped him but what is that going to prove

yeah a lot more 

Recording: (949/ 10720) 
you would think but i do not know there has to be something like why you know the first state thatdoe that does it i mean i afterf one i am sure others would follow suit  after they see the benefits of it but that first one i do not know 

Recording: (950/ 10720)

Recording: (951/ 10720) 
leaders would meet with him once a week and then they would come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do  enough for blacks nd he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to sayse to some of my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see the grater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said yu know that would be great and an ideal world this is not an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not i said what you are going to do is you are going nto make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you are going to give people a

um most of my paintings uh this is going to sound funny most of my paintings are of uh images from star wars 

Recording: (954/ 10720) 
i do not know uh maybe  i think abe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more ik iy have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it so it is just like people always talk about you know education for thah you know we got to like think about our child is fuchere or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and i do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get 

Recording: (955/ 10720) 
so i am not going to get any fairness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me the award saying that they decided in their favor and all that crapt well you know fine uh but i am not going to i am not going to pay hem until they contact me again 

Recording: (956/ 10720) 
or had no real relevante to their lives i mean i think the kids would would rally immediately ad the issue right now is that there is nothing there 

Recording: (957/ 10720) 
and it stays with you for years  they do not realize that nobody tells them until after the fac 

Recording: (958/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (959/ 10720) 
that is it that is what i worry about the larger school systems too that is what concerns me with hillbir you get such a large variety of people compared to like where i was in the smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it is your parents knew their parent yeah your parents knew their parents her parents  ew they you know now you know and i walkd to my friend is house and half her friends if she is going over to play they are ging to drive them almost because they are they are all around so 

Recording: (960/ 10720) 
uh and she we really like her she is really  we enjoyed being with her but sometimes i am gorthen being with my son uh 

Recording: (961/ 10720) 
really enjoy one of the things i do not like about living in e big city is is like but i have got ten used to but i i do not like i fact that every time you look up in the night sky although you see is this like orange hase  you can not see stars very well uh the noise  i mean there is always noise i amember last you are living in the dorms every morning at two thirty in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in tailer so it is 

Recording: (962/ 10720) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy togethere only thing that is going to happen is it is going to chuckle down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like it s you you know people say it is my fault because hitis happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um 

Recording: (963/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (964/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (965/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (966/ 10720) 
well like amelia miles down to the south end or something like that but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers 

Recording: (967/ 10720) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room to all myself you know i do not want to go some place whr i wn o have to leak deal with somebody tin so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once igo 

Recording: (968/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (969/ 10720) 
umhumand they should and very rarely do doctors even ask you about alorgies and i more and more and people do not even realize hand they get sick so often they need to ask about alorgies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out what is wrong with them because a lot of times it is alergic reactions to things they have eaten 

Recording: (970/ 10720) 
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (971/ 10720) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior ou go in the morning and you r senior oud go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cur centeran then you go

Recording: (977/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (978/ 10720) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable prog progression that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her and actually her brother is a felow fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know them all that well butuhparently her family i mean she is she is double majorn history ind chemistry she plans to go to medschool her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it

Recording: (980/ 10720) 
umm 

Recording: (981/ 10720) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um i never i never did it and i you know wish i could have waited so i was married but i you know you are going through that whatever you go through when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people just some kids still do that but i think i guess i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (982/ 10720) 
oh i was good to say it would be interesting 

Recording: (983/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (984/ 10720) 
has to be a longstanding kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than um i i undersand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know uh you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gave marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either 

Recording: (985/ 10720) 
you know crime is a lot worse now you know on the streets than it used to be 

Recording: (986/ 10720) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (987/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (988/ 10720) 
that is i mean we would be seventy years old when the kid graduates from high school uh and that would not be fair to the kid and and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so we talked about int decided it was not a good idea 

Recording: (989/ 10720) 
yea 

Recording: (990/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (991/ 10720)

Recording: (995/ 10720) 
i have to amit when we go to try play golf sometimes and not have a teatime you can not even get in 

Recording: (996/ 10720) 
they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything an we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pensile and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (997/ 10720) 
the world because i have heard i have heard stories you know yeah you can  et the people  pay them like but why  but but it is like yeah if you say it is true i wll look into it is that okay is 

Recording: (998/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (999/ 10720) 
owe that goes with the disorder they know they know when who is butten to push and when not to push ya button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you always that is why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (1000/ 10720) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people ave are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in collumbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they are from the south or something like that so theynd then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in collumbus so

yeah i did 

Recording: (1002/ 10720) 
eah a tyeah it was interesting

image you present that you have got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place you are gong to be out of the loop and you know if if people ware just a little more comfortable with themselves you know and i like i am a big one to talk i was like minster insecure for thirty years at least and then i find ly get the point and i went t uthe help with it you know it is too much work you know either like me your do not if you do not go to somebody else and you know u a lot of people arere really worried and you know i do not know if boys so much but i know girls are really worried about what people think of them and how they look and 

Recording: (1202/ 10720) 
and theirs needs were immediate 

Recording: (1203/ 10720) 
that flipped me out nown i could not handle that that i am not ready for thatnd i mean that was crazy she was twenty three the first person i have ever dated her as older than me and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like dead serious she was a hundred percent sure i was the person she was going to marry and i ill see her at church every so often and she will cm up and give me big hug she is like i miss you uam like well i miss you too not probably the way you miss me but i miss i miss you uwh she is an lunitic you know  no 

Recording: (1204/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (1205/ 10720) 
um yeah 

Recording: (1206/ 10720) 
not know i like the story um 

Recording: (1207/ 10720) 
everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (1208/ 10720) 
what was going on you know i mean uh  stic tragidy i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh eleven years old or something like that well an accidental shooting yaim and hem and uh uh another friend of mine from same same class you know uh he puld a gun shot him you know  did not know tha damthing was liveted but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where if some kid 

Recording: (1209/ 10720) 
they think everything they say is helarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transitioning from childhood to adult hood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not rite and you can not spell then it is just even worse is i it is exasterbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (1210/ 10720) 
i think outside of the honerst program a lot of it is but within the honerst program i thinkthere is some really really exceptional things going on 

Recording: (1211/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (1212/ 10720) 
so there is there is no faulting mai meat for these folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative n response to say to this experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately folwing it on never mind pretend i never said that 

Recording: (1213/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (1214/ 10720) 
ncase they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they would not be liable 

Recording: (1215/ 10720) 
i know 

Recording: (1216/ 10720) 
i would get more people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i am making about ten or eleven bucks an hour 

Recording: (1217/ 10720) 
gun control i am not really too interested in i mean you look at israol people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they are one of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they are relatively safe so i mean 

Recording: (1218/ 10720) 
uh it is bisiop redy it is atkuh you  you are noffing around here it is a it is a it is a cassic scol over on the west side 

Recording: (1219/ 10720) 
yeah which cracks me up because if you have ever looked at the parents of models they are not necessarily all that attractive  yeah 

Recording: (1220/ 10720) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go 

Recording: (1221/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (1222/ 10720) 
thatis that is her job is ja spoile them so the por things i have like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground  yep

Recording: (1224/ 10720) 
i think so 

Recording: (1225/ 10720) 
oh yeah and you know i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook read meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make sups a lot of good souups for him with meat and it really does not bother me to cook it you know i am not going to sit home and mak it roast every night 

Recording: (1226/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (1227/ 10720) 
even harder 

Recording: (1228/ 10720) 
it is just the sp the spiritual aspect there is a relm even instine the most brilliant man supposedly mathmatically of our time uh even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory 

Recording: (1229/ 10720) 
uhwa the problem is is uh an like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at eightam well an airport has so many runways and so many taxeways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and staind up there and hold while there you know shooting them in what they do is they 

Recording: (1230/ 10720) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (1231/ 10720) 
eah that part was no different i am no 

Recording: (1232/ 10720) 
t is sort of like the definition of need versus luxury  uh those definitions changed the definitions of socialism and democracy they slowly have changed over these times well the same thing will true be true wot those it is still functioning  excuse me um and i think we will also slowly swing that pengilum on back to the and to the family again 

Recording: (1233/ 10720) 
yeahandoe no 

Recording: (1234/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (1235/ 10720) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (1236/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (1237/ 10720) 
i started this school year off with uh twenty seven kindergarteners and no aid 

Recording: (1238/ 10720) 
yes 

Recording: (1239/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (1240/ 10720) 
umhum it does 

Recording: (1241/ 10720) 
would say there would be certain life application things that all kods should know but not i do not a think that you caud say everything you know you have everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (1242/ 10720) 
absent for the whole day which would be considered truent so they said i what i had to do was go down to juvenile to the certain gentleman in juvinile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was a school should hav did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son in getting ready to go eleventh grade and 

Recording: (1243/ 10720) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoingthing where my in fact i have been real unhappy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they u i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plaine trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to 

Recording: (1244/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (1245/ 10720) 
that um incompuses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is caos even though it seems like it is an accident uh there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is 

Recording: (1246/ 10720) 
umhu 

Recording: (1247/ 10720) 
uh it is not really an office he is like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sightes he he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and and then he gets to uh talk with the the other contractors and he works together with them but he is really jus there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sightes 

Recording: (1248/ 10720) 
you know mixed race or or handicapped or you know hard to place 

Recording: (1249/ 10720) 
or um 

Recording: (1250/ 10720) 
at each other is throat for this that and the other and in you know devenism my daughter is n wen er really got putting the middle of itno and probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint loeuis because theree probably could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth to court and putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff you know and souh uh in hind side it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (1251/ 10720) 
and uh a dissease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (1252/ 10720) 
or um like the art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival in doblin which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that um the concerts on the river r on the worthington green really anything like that 

Recording: (1253/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1254/ 10720) 
and

Recording: (1260/ 10720) 
well it is kind of it is kind of hard when you have got your your limited choices here you know some of uh some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you are looking at the maoal candidates did you watch that debate 

Recording: (1261/ 10720) 
because it stopps your heart right away 

Recording: (1262/ 10720) 
they do not have that for collumbus schools 

Recording: (1263/ 10720) 
yeah they will just take one scripture and they will expand it um and ad they will just run with that one scripture and then there are also churches that will just deleats they will  in m in their minds they will deleat certain sections of the scripture that they do not like first carinthians chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here in collumbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and and um 

Recording: (1264/ 10720)

Recording: (1269/ 10720) 
at is you did in australia

e are going to land out there 

Recording: (1272/ 10720) 
they did not want the world war two vision any more uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by an large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really undertande difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and carasamatic and so did clinton so i think for the average voter that does have uh a lot of sway 

Recording: (1273/ 10720)

Recording: (1274/ 10720) 
and your display might be different but it is it is basic information and ir and we developed the system that people started doing that on and sharing the data uh actually it started here at on  issue campus and now we are independent

Recording: (1280/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (1281/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (1282/ 10720) 
um i would like to teach um ian the the field is particularly saturated right now so i am not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am approaching things like whatever happens happens i am going to pursue my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career 

Recording: (1283/ 10720) 
i do not know that is so controversial i i mean i mean to the point i mean they show them how to bout condoms on bananas in public schools and it is like well are you promoting sex then oror do i

and one of them they d loked at in collumbus was uh how whill he was doing it school well gt children off have the ig one of the highest dropper outrates in schools and they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money tomy my feeling is you know there s a lot of programs in school that sponswered by the federal government particularly uh to help the students are that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (1293/ 10720) 
you know to get a a four or five dollar a year taxcut

as a teacher how would you  how could you cut down a student say no that is not the way it was and it is that you are loaking from the teacher is guid no but how do you know ithout asking the person but it is a matter of tradition handing it down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way in that way and it is it is not necessary ritten down but it is passed on those days it is probably written down or not ritten down by verbal and extended and so it is that hand

Recording: (1622/ 10720) 
by saying that um colman had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for a chiefe but he voted for a rae for the the police officers it is just that you know the police chiefs was tied to his and i do not like people who tried to manipulate facts uh and and that was manipulating the facts i did not like that she was um u uh a against the the the tiff uh in pileris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was wright or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with

Recording: (1630/ 10720)

or she she um she does not know about all of them you know like ius she found out about the eighty ach just like we all you know and i guess like a couple of the kids in the class had it had it ere on it you know and she is like o was that and she is like i will have to figure out that stuff you know she called uh one of the caseworkers and figured out the whole program and she come in and told another girl about it she told me about ithum 

Recording: (1642/ 10720) 
of uh all the off campus kids to like to the police and so like they start driving around around ten thirty trying to bust them for noise on the weekends so it is pretty hectic 

Recording: (1643/ 10720) 
and i would definitely keep a eye out and you knowj figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (1644/ 10720) 
now they have different art classes and different speech and uh language classes different levels of science and it is kind of like a college campus 

Recording: (1645/ 10720) 
oay 

Recording: (1646/ 10720) 
you probably see it better uow not that fot  not that one but yea it is just certain things make person themselves 

Recording: (1647/ 10720) 
ou my name now 

Recording: (1648/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (1649/ 10720)

Recording: (1651/ 10720) 
yeah yeah ii if if i there there can not be sanctions for doing the right thing and um uh so u i would be i am opposed to that i well yeah i i guess you would have to say that i wous i would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything um in in in that relation that it is just that the effort should focus on on getting them 

Recording: (1652/ 10720) 
yeah i take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it is biology i get a break i do no i wond like to take twenty nine hours of it

Recording: (1656/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (1657/ 10720) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (1658/ 10720) 
y just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot umand i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many rural errors and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is aways hase to do with money and they am not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked and all these big large classrooms it just seems to me when 

Recording: (1659/ 10720) 
um he is a business man 

Recording: (1660/ 10720) 
yeah i it says 

Recording: (1661/ 10720) 
it was real close to my home 

Recording: (1662/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (1663/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (1664/ 10720) 
i got a son and then he is got a son so i guess i am a grandfather i hardly ever see him 

Recording: (1665/ 10720) 
okay wel that is a good job i mean because you are good flextime yeah it wasshe 

Recording: (1666/ 10720) 
i uh well that is a that is a tough one uh i remember you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know we are it was you prtty much knew it was alf pake anyway you know but and to me that is a pake and uh uh and i never e really thought about  while i was growing up that it was what was real and everything uh i always knew that by i there again you know by my dad being 

Recording: (1667/ 10720) 
nyway he he went in for listing here i think and then he was discharged and then he was called back again and sent to vitanum and it was uh sort of a tromatic experience for him then i think he was pretty well come out of but he was in a rir area he never was up where he was doing any shootingt himself but 

Recording: (1668/ 10720) 
i do not know what kind that is because i know they they traded airplanes since i have been gone 

Recording: (1669/ 10720) 
it was our job

uh 

Recording: (1671/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1672/ 10720) 
um i think they might have tried any help but obviously they would not have been as uh good at it or you know what i am trying to say it would not have been as much distruction because obviously the bombs is something but to actually have that right there i mean have the access and what not i mean i guess the grandparents had the house locked than they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew  how to use them and uh that scares me 

Recording: (1673/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (1674/ 10720) 
l these loose ends that they keep having i suspect they probably will not do that they will um leave things open ended for future tv movies or maybe another uh feature length movie uh 

Recording: (1675/ 10720)

and basically they were three weeks long they were about four and a half hours the first one was really long you know jacon w  i can not take tat t last night was not so bad though i mean the first one was a lot of lot of information classroom kind of stuff but he did real well he was much uh he is tust o sweet he is just wonderful he was much more interactive than than a lot of the other guys were just kind of you know they would sit there and they were not breathing and they were n kind of rolling their eyes and i just think kidy budge of bumbs you know it is going to come down to it 

Recording: (1713/ 10720) 
oh tha well they knew all all different things i mean i mean culturally you know it was different different music it was it f course i am i am in a suburban high school in cincinnaty you did not get exposed to much uh so that w that was th the biggest thing well of course they talkd funny in the east but um  you know other than that other than the culture shock um it was not it was not that different 

Recording: (1714/ 10720) 
right if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat wher i i think almost anybody can beat goor right now but you know in in in election times a weekend is a couple of centuries uh a year is an eon you know so anything tha happened between now and then but i think a dol had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and we will go with the moderate candidate uh which is basically where clinton placed 

Recording: (1715/ 10720) 
because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the hight of arogance um you know but but men feel threattened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not know but it is not a mind sat i have so it is hard for me to understand

right 

Recording: (1721/ 10720) 
right  same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the hose they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody le they had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situations got that way but i do belive that the older people including are government people and everybody at is the the top has to set the example and 

Recording: (1722/ 10720) 
yes 

Recording: (1723/ 10720) 
yea

Recording: (1736/ 10720) 
umo 

Recording: (1737/ 10720)

like management 

Recording: (1798/ 10720) 
but they he kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you are not going to provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so here was a case in my opinion a very very honest uh politician but he was also being shoved away from what he felt was an honest approach

really 

Recording: (1800/ 10720) 
seminaries in the us and it is a republican tink think tink thank  republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural and i do not know i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community  it is just great all around for raising a family no no i want to find to i want to find some place similar to that i want to find some place smt ao that

Recording: (1822/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (1823/ 10720)

Recording: (1985/ 10720) 
trying to raise my hopes up about it but then they had this other kid who was actually really into veteranary medicine and flying helecoptors and all that and he really did go on to uh study about that myself cook  but

uh we were floating around just did not know if they were going to send us in or not because it was toward the end of it 

Recording: (1989/ 10720) 
oh that is it 

Recording: (1990/ 10720) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that thatfeel the same way i do about things my oldest sister you know i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (1991/ 10720) 
so that means you are a good problem solver you are a good logical thinker you are good in cience you are good in math you know so there is a few things you are not good at toes not mean you are stupid you know i would much rather be stranded on an island with six 

Recording: (1992/ 10720) 
and uh well she i the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first department community uh in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess

Recording: (2000/ 10720) 
d that kind of thing i think is pretty important just you know because of the simple factor of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be you know safe about it 

Recording: (2001/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2002/ 10720)

Recording: (2009/ 10720) 
tha dot it is going to be just the opposit and thavi i can not think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can not think of them a negative thing about them because you see cristes appearence comes through them 

Recording: (2010/ 10720)

i mean colen pow was pretty close if he would have ran 

Recording: (2202/ 10720)

Recording: (2203/ 10720) 
and h how many dollars does a consumer put into research as supposed to the business that is the inequity in our life and you are you are basicaly putting tha shaft to the consumer 

Recording: (2204/ 10720) 
and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am going to keep with it you know and to me the straght ay a student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their life at all and the other one has you know activities and they are giving of themselves to the community you know you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteere at cos sie and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter heg hunts for that school is 

Recording: (2205/ 10720)

child careand 

Recording: (2207/ 10720) 
yeah i like that 

Recording: (2208/ 10720) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (2209/ 10720) 
know umhum that is another thing i forgot to mention  uhu exactly just 

Recording: (2210/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2211/ 10720) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is 

Recording: (2212/ 10720) 
i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if uh you know the the man is not willing to do it or whatever so and and and addoption and all the other things 

Recording: (2213/ 10720) 
ih 

Recording: (2214/ 10720) 
exactly 

Recording: (2215/ 10720) 
yeahh 

Recording: (2216/ 10720) 
c for twenty two buildings in the northeast area do a lot of chillers and laser labs and chilled water for uh different kinds of experiments they are doing in the chemistry departments and stuff like that so went to school through a technical school for to get a degree in the uh hvc stuff oh yeah i like it is everyday is different you have different problems everyday you know and i like working 

Recording: (2217/ 10720) 
so she is and hopefully they will get married soe they have been together for  over a year and a half 

Recording: (2218/ 10720) 
where do you do the arobics 

Recording: (2219/ 10720) 
who cares so you know people just think there is no really now point to even vote  it is too bad it really is 

Recording: (2220/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (2221/ 10720) 
exciting 

Recording: (2222/ 10720) 
i i do not think that it it goes into like values i do not associate like riseing crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i i mean it if there is a corolation i mean uh uh im more of the you know like you know parents have a greater influence on the children than tv ever could i mean i  watched a lot of tv but i feel that my parentst 

Recording: (2223/ 10720) 
i remember mgufhy lain i do not know if you  know who they are yeah 

Recording: (2224/ 10720) 
t so there wias a big fuss about that then two years later they come out with another study this iys whly they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuild them and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are amost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like well if you are gon to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (2225/ 10720) 
do you 

Recording: (2226/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2227/ 10720) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (2228/ 10720) 
yeah i like to go up there and play pool once in a while 

Recording: (2229/ 10720) 
so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have st college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh but once in a while we will get wind players that play in it also and um sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something 

Recording: (2230/ 10720) 
yeah yeah  i do not see figure that out i think it is all i think it is all fixed 

Recording: (2231/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (2232/ 10720) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourself aao as others and i think as you as we become older you start thinking about how um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here  uh professes to be the thing 

Recording: (2233/ 10720) 
oh yeah um yes and no they are kind of weird like that um one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything they are sat on the other side that they are a little bit more racisd um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up 

Recording: (2234/ 10720) 
on this family he came from a buffalo new york working class he leffetd he never looked back either and so it is kind of like ye aniare both people always tak say you know how we are such i i do not know we get the schools are always so gratful to us because we organized the state chest tournaments he started the baseball legue for the building you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so greateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids 

Recording: (2235/ 10720) 
needed a break 

Recording: (2236/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2237/ 10720) 
l right 

Recording: (2238/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2239/ 10720) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (2240/ 10720)

Recording: (2244/ 10720) 
and it is funny too how people careo like people appologize toyou whand when they are dumb or whatever and it is like like they care so much you know about somebody that they are talking to on the phone for like five minutes umh it it is  people sometimes ask me like where where we are you know  i tell them like cllhembus ohio and like um like i talk to some lady from from uh new jersey she was like twenty or something for for a long time she is she was real funny just uh how how accents are 

Recording: (2245/ 10720) 
actually i think it was stampfor it was on a tv show i think it was like extra or something i do not know what it was and they er had a program on where um these older students you know met for the first time in a uh at their graduation you know they finished their whole college on internet a i said well that would be very easy for me and i could do it at my convenience like when he is asleep i can go and do that i think it would make it a lot easier 

Recording: (2246/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (2247/ 10720) 
cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (2248/ 10720)

Recording: (2256/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2257/ 10720) 
all i remember is the m talking about condems i do not think they talked about anything besides that but um then again i could be remembering rong uh but yes that i mean it is the stand but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have 

Recording: (2258/ 10720)

ooh boy like action oh fight the bad guys yeah and now it is uh you know like looking in uh sort of postulating deeper meaning to yo w like what the characters have to go through using elements of thes story as a meteifor for things in real life uh and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and uppon our culture i think it is kind of interesting 

Recording: (2284/ 10720) 
eah and i do not know if it is quite that bad b but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are not are not approved of and i am not real up on that so

just change the language 

Recording: (2293/ 10720)

you can not isolate yourself from them it is like americans americans do not have a have a have a stronghold on it 

Recording: (2302/ 10720) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over says tha that is okay it that othe person does it to you i mean there my mother used to say if for every law that was ritten there is another law ritten over here that w will actually nolify that one and i and actually as i have growing older i found that and it is it is worse than today is world as i said as the silver rights movement and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is

yeah 

Recording: (2308/ 10720) 
f course with orters if you hit you did not have to hit them direct you could hit them right beside them and flip them over 

Recording: (2309/ 10720)

Recording: (2310/ 10720) 
umhum yeah this was three years ago about three years ago a now i guess there will be three and yeah it was how verminni was that an eighty nine or ninety or something like that well it is  it gets more and more um like u it is not like america but more and more like a regular democracy every year i mean not really but it is closer and closer  a little bit

Recording: (2330/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (2331/ 10720) 
but 

Recording: (2332/ 10720) 
and everything and so uh i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people who are ill are sick and try to help them with their  you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is a disease okay and it so now we try to help alcoholics well uh certainly murdering s 

Recording: (2333/ 10720)

Recording: (2412/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (2413/ 10720)

Recording: (2423/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (2424/ 10720) 
i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rigtes moviments and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i meann more like more of the generations of today or whatever like basically any one under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (2425/ 10720) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (2426/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2427/ 10720) 
it is like an advertisement for it

i had the same thing happened to my kid i i smacked him one time 

Recording: (2430/ 10720) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (2431/ 10720) 
yeah um and  this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very uh conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working as a freelancwer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (2432/ 10720) 
you know uh a chick magnet 

Recording: (2433/ 10720)

Recording: (2437/ 10720)

Recording: (2438/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2439/ 10720) 
at is pretty cood 

Recording: (2440/ 10720) 
maybe because she says es americans are different 

Recording: (2441/ 10720)

yeah 

Recording: (2445/ 10720) 
emma is sort of a timeless name ind that it is it is you know been around for a long time yet people do not associate it with old women because there are still emmas today

oh yeah yeah what religion are you  oh that one has all those those going ruls that do not work out in real life christianity yea 

Recording: (2448/ 10720) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do become a i am a christian so i believe that homelo sexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not going to condem them um at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out  maybe that child um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort 

Recording: (2449/ 10720) 
and and she is very determined uh she has said that having this being pregnant and having thise baby is made her focus on things a lot differently she says she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (2450/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2451/ 10720) 
there was an indemp story about that i think it was i do nt wate is harper is magazine or what it was in a uhu a significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation andi i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh  as a matter of fact whatever it was i remember sending it in to the uh city counciluh of date you know i just addressed i

umhum 

Recording: (2454/ 10720) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that 

Recording: (2455/ 10720) 
do not i am not real up on everything that is been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish pople would be a little bit more focused and  and you would be able to say you know this is there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of and and i do not i its think people kind of loddiot and  say well this is it is like this you know well we will see what we can kind of do about it and then we will you know 

Recording: (2456/ 10720) 
everything and i come back and you know where my parents there were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know this like gieant caymaratland you know i mean it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i woauld grown up with in america my whole life and you know not that i sort of changed completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to eastin and i 

Recording: (2457/ 10720) 
that is parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyied my husband said i i would have let her stay i do not now intrstand why you are doing this i do not care i wan he to come home the other well the bottom i was histerical because she and this little boy they are outside and he they are jumping on he is jumping on the trampelly and i go aukt to thim and i introduced them myself and i say you know hunny i said am really sorry about the plans but i just you could n i just could not let you g her stay there that long he goes wol that is okay my mom would never let me do that so and i am think ing you know here an o everybody is acting like i am the bad guy and 

Recording: (2458/ 10720) 
um yeah like i knew m uh like a lot of people who live down on campus i used to live down on hudson like over the summer before i went to ishe um so i mean i like campus and everything it is just like oshe is different than campus yeah 

Recording: (2459/ 10720) 
yes um undergadt sudent 

Recording: (2460/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (2461/ 10720) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like they said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like with research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condem it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (2462/ 10720) 
to her two children so she is become very active in the adoption procedure in talsa and uh 

Recording: (2463/ 10720)

Recording: (2466/ 10720) 
yeah uh yeah for them to go to a d yeah mak i would think it for them to interact with the kids more yeah but where he goes there is he is got ill thise cousins and stuff that with them so 

Recording: (2467/ 10720) 
right she is woneer last year 

Recording: (2468/ 10720) 
ohy

Recording: (2470/ 10720) 
wol 

Recording: (2471/ 10720) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough veolists or something you know an instrument like that um but they they we usually get enough to play concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for last few rehearsals umhum so we sort of have stringers i guess you would call tem yeah we have actually 

Recording: (2472/ 10720)

in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my gol my goll was not to change hearts and minds my golle was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury 

Recording: (2476/ 10720) 
i 

Recording: (2477/ 10720) 
well and and the ambiguous part of it you know just sa trying to be protective of the ways

Recording: (2517/ 10720) 
oh 

Recording: (2518/ 10720) 
yeah it is going to have to be from the bottom up i think and everybody keeps and i i am just getting a kick out of all the advercements and everything nd they are coming with two thousand on it well i am hoping people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but i am hoping that it does mean since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope uh whytkay i do not know what that really stands for 

Recording: (2519/ 10720) 
no not really um all my good friends from well i would say like out of all my good friends from high school one of them  know two of them are still here 

Recording: (2520/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (2521/ 10720) 
and i could not be a part of a veteranary practice that uh did that 

Recording: (2522/ 10720) 
ou know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying oh you know he ud you know slept with like ten girls or something and i was thinking oh my gosh you know and heis thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is 

Recording: (2523/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (2524/ 10720) 
yeah i i was really glad that my son uh  you know was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because uh you know the guys are real real nice you know very it is you know he is always kind of been like real stambed offish when it comes to 

Recording: (2525/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2526/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2527/ 10720) 
and i mean it is it is a easy to spell it is easy to say and you know you can shorten it to m or 

Recording: (2528/ 10720) 
so it is still just sitting down and my computer sits next to it um the only thing is if you take it downa you can only have half a desk 

Recording: (2529/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2530/ 10720) 
oh 

Recording: (2531/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2532/ 10720) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will anser the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a se or a be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes of his or crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is 

Recording: (2533/ 10720) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things and little children is minds and yeven you know like in junior hide that oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence in when we were grown up there was not any violence on tv we werent allowed to watch it but you know i mean i men the comics were not violent um now it is too open for kids the parents you know they say the parentshoul 

Recording: (2534/ 10720) 
you know you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you cand work two two hours a day you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so 

Recording: (2535/ 10720) 
m stuff done you know and i do not know if it is if it is just because you know you have to get agreement from all the other all th everybody else in government before you can pass anything or or why you know why i do not think things get taken care of i mean there ise so many different issues that people want to look at and you end up focusing on things like fillip moris you know which is like tha begues thing in the whole world you know and and there ise so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are that are important i just i do not know maybe i mean i do not i do not 

Recording: (2536/ 10720)

he left her there and i they said they called me but i did i was run the sweeper soi teand hear the phone so left her there and he said that she was going to call back you know at at a certain time and i was going totell her what she could hor could not do so i said you know we e goingno have to come here home you know he is going to have to come and get you o come on a and no we are not going to do that i you know you can not be this late so he went back down picked him up and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (2538/ 10720) 
yeah they will not bother 

Recording: (2539/ 10720) 
yeah it is been like that ever year 

Recording: (2540/ 10720) 
so that like it is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (2541/ 10720) 
you know and these schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand excuse me people and just to try to moniter different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know and checking everything and 

Recording: (2542/ 10720) 
it is and plus the thing youis to f like when we bought our house we had looked for uh months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that had not been kept up 

Recording: (2543/ 10720)

Recording: (2546/ 10720) 
definitely so my daughter definitely of course she was working for camps carstivrit crist and she came home one weekend from uh oxford and uh 

Recording: (2547/ 10720) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger and i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged to him but i decided to 

Recording: (2548/ 10720)

Recording: (2549/ 10720) 
i think my daughter genipher is very active um not so much uh the type of work that i do but i think she is very cheritable very giving very uh 

Recording: (2550/ 10720) 
yeah i mean i can not say that thare ol be any difference with them 

Recording: (2551/ 10720) 
convict white men ofof killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (2552/ 10720) 
u yeah 

Recording: (2553/ 10720) 
because i have seen things that are not physically possible 

Recording: (2554/ 10720) 
bad accoustics really 

Recording: (2555/ 10720) 
well yeah we got broke into uh think twice and stuff got stollen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into nd th gas sifened pretty much everybody around there is been uh criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (2556/ 10720) 
so the money is just kind of wasted 

Recording: (2557/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2558/ 10720) 
well when i was growing up there was not a that much violence and i could go in indiana and i have done it  i my name an on this report so you can not do nothing abou 

Recording: (2559/ 10720) 
but they do not use umbrellas i mean they just go through it they are just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket you know you know because it is not a hard rain and the first year i was there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there is no cold real cold winter and uh and then from july august september and aoctober it is just gorgeous just so gorgeous but i like i like that fog and that mist and 

Recording: (2560/ 10720) 
s a real um slap on the face for him so he was really mean after that so i laughed i just i walked out i picked the kids up at the bust off and they are like momy what are you doing i say we are going somewhere youa lo getin the car  so but um yeah just a couple of experiences like that they will make you do other things so you know i stayed toughh and i you know got other jobs and 

Recording: (2561/ 10720) 
but it is mine boggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams you know it is just min bogling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a handful of people and do not know anybody else like you know a lot more of a tight nit group as a child so we had three elementary schools ind one high school and that was it 

Recording: (2562/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2563/ 10720) 
i have that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not work thin the ways thatother peoples do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very  i have always been real lot more temporamental we always joke you know that the predictable and some of those things are not um even tempered oare not things you would use to describe men nik but but but 

Recording: (2564/ 10720) 
b 

Recording: (2565/ 10720) 
rigt 

Recording: (2566/ 10720) 
very different uh ere just been a lot of innovations and 

Recording: (2567/ 10720) 
um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever um just because obviously you basically mymic your parents as far as what you do when you are young and things like that and obviously if you ol had two maile parents or whatever obviously you might be thinking  more towards like dating guys and things like that um i 

Recording: (2568/ 10720) 
i do not know if it is where it is but i definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments and projects in the chunnel 

Recording: (2569/ 10720) 
her her little boy friend who was the the captin cirk commander riker like stud persona i see in many ways uh i mean i agree in deep space  on big deepspace an i mean it is like i do not dislike voyager i just do not like it to the same degree um in deep spacen nine they had major kera who was a solger and a revolutionary and in i thought in many ways she completely broke out of traditional gender roles i also like 

Recording: (2570/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2571/ 10720) 
you know because y you are learning more about yourself and uh you are you are also learning more about like you are experiencing a lot of freedoms that you did not have obviously you know you are driving 

Recording: (2572/ 10720) 
i had three yeuh they are all grown up and have kids the are own i have grandchidrens in that age nu 

Recording: (2573/ 10720) 
no 

Recording: (2574/ 10720) 
right right 

Recording: (2575/ 10720) 
hat they should do is just tell people if their kids do not get tho go to school i bet the attitude changes pretty fast 

Recording: (2576/ 10720) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot an animal t be shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they ui know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money and did not have any food theyj would not killtd some animals and gave itto hemn i do not have a problem with that uh uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charleton heston tells him 

Recording: (2577/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (2578/ 10720) 
uhhuh uhhuh well and you know that song by itself probably if i just heard it once or twice it is okay  yeah and she is an interesting character i guess i mean i do not know everything about her but i i remember that she insulted the pope  yah 

Recording: (2579/ 10720) 
and it probably did and it probably did have something to deal with it uh because after allh so much speaking up and they want to do things my welwl well bing crosby who was it no um 

Recording: (2580/ 10720) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack oh  on the bottom uh with a baire hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know h my the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and you know it 

Recording: (2581/ 10720) 
even though my kids are not there they will stop by my house jst to say high 

Recording: (2582/ 10720) 
oh yeah it is 

Recording: (2583/ 10720) 
no 

Recording: (2584/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2585/ 10720) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory a band and it had mostly to do with whether you were thereor  whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument  i i do not think we ever got as bs and cs  yeah 

Recording: (2586/ 10720) 
yeah right 

Recording: (2587/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2588/ 10720) 
because it is more open um and you couch it in terms of civil rights u my boy friends thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based 

Recording: (2589/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2590/ 10720) 
thand i 

Recording: (2591/ 10720) 
yes to but that more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is been a because of a loss of a parent thor inability of a parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes  those things do exist and they wa always have some but that is a very small percentage those got 

Recording: (2592/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (2593/ 10720) 
it does it is nice it looks out well 

Recording: (2594/ 10720) 
you can not especially with kids t is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (2595/ 10720) 
and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (2596/ 10720) 
you start thinking a lttle diferently and i think as you talk yousould be talking to some older people i am seying people in the in the eighties to find out how the progression of life is and how you think because when you go to a state sales all you are talking abot this proper motive they are sitting on ther lawns the quality of life is in the mind of the person youre youyou avoid it all the time 

Recording: (2597/ 10720) 
if it yu just have to have something to go by and this is a close thay you kn if we have too just go with it you know i mean you can not go back and try to read i now sometime somebody was trying to rearrange the calinder one time were not they 

Recording: (2598/ 10720) 
mhum 

Recording: (2599/ 10720) 
oh okay 

Recording: (2600/ 10720) 
is theire the resentment to things like macdonald is there too or is it 

Recording: (2601/ 10720) 
over that right and 

Recording: (2602/ 10720) 
argry about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can concive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what jeens that you might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not  later on you w find out but it is still you can go back and you can find the parent and 

Recording: (2603/ 10720) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the  some elementary school i believe or know i think t is a high school and marrian was built on um an old weapons deepo and so like lukemia is risen and so like that is what their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things uh a ther ti they do anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (2604/ 10720) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to tha yeah there is a lot there there isjus way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europeo s like okay i will go to europ 

Recording: (2605/ 10720)

eastern religions and i have listened to the jove as witnesses and and and then when i read in the book of morman it is just ie it is a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really felt at home with this and that is why i decided 

Recording: (2664/ 10720) 
yeh 

Recording: (2665/ 10720) 
well but see i think if you really chary to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is loved and you know you should not do it 

Recording: (2666/ 10720)

i mean to me you are supposed to earn your grade 

Recording: (2682/ 10720) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (2683/ 10720) 
oh gosh  that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (2684/ 10720)

Recording: (2688/ 10720) 
i come back and it is just youknow 

Recording: (2689/ 10720) 
hum 

Recording: (2690/ 10720) 
right um at the age that they were 

Recording: (2691/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (2692/ 10720) 
umhum yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like twelve and thirteen and they have been having sex since they were ten and it is just like  and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (2693/ 10720) 
but with kids in therre just so much more active at a early age 

Recording: (2694/ 10720) 
people that just uh really want to teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people want to like even whent into teaching at all you know but um i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grade it is like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more  compulsary education is weird like being forced 

Recording: (2695/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2696/ 10720) 
really 

Recording: (2697/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (2698/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (2699/ 10720) 
u now i think i i just think that typically you see a lot of o lot of places that are that are under construction not very many people working there 

Recording: (2700/ 10720) 
and just because youar i meaw i was not really uh an athletic i did play uh sports when i was not in high school but i wa dancer  was not any good you know as tas n like other guys but whether i did or whether i did not you know i would i do not i do not nobody picked on meu kno i mean one time i got into it w with one of the uh centers in football you know a big old guy and been uh  and i w  still about seing sise but 

Recording: (2701/ 10720) 
i am from here collumbus ohio yeah 

Recording: (2702/ 10720)

Recording: (2703/ 10720) 
well um i i suppose  well i i decided that i was groing to dayt a black guy and my my dad did not like that at all so he disowned me and so now he i am married to my husband and 

Recording: (2704/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2705/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (2706/ 10720) 
yeah it is mainly what happens is uh you get all the out of town bad stuff yea i mean it just kind of absorbs like a spunge 

Recording: (2707/ 10720) 
all right 

Recording: (2708/ 10720) 
boring 

Recording: (2709/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (2710/ 10720) 
andi i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah i just a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (2711/ 10720) 
huh 

Recording: (2712/ 10720) 
just getting over there 

Recording: (2713/ 10720) 
byy 

Recording: (2714/ 10720) 
she is pretty nice i mean she is definitely at least standable and 

Recording: (2715/ 10720) 
yeah most of them 

Recording: (2716/ 10720) 
thougt this was something like maybe uni unique to the states 

Recording: (2717/ 10720) 
umhum umhum umhum 

Recording: (2718/ 10720) 
ou know because then what dos yeu have to hide and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage than entire you know antire economy 

Recording: (2719/ 10720) 
i guess that happened just here in town ah couple of thm about a week ago or something like that you know where a guy shot another guyy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really you know and who is really thefault and who is really  who is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh not to date ever would ove but if if one of the two that you an calomba and you know if they would have survived i would like 

Recording: (2720/ 10720) 
i think um the people who have already graduated there like to the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids di not want to go it it is just thought of atis a somewhat party school 

Recording: (2721/ 10720) 
oh definitely deinitely well i have never had a dog and i have always wanted one 

Recording: (2722/ 10720) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine everyday just suk git s mine t take mine every day and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is ah some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case 

Recording: (2723/ 10720) 
think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidatea over candidate be because they will protect abbortion rights that isis going to divide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2724/ 10720) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (2725/ 10720) 
it is 

Recording: (2726/ 10720)

Recording: (2728/ 10720) 
um i think the fact things like responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know thinks as far as people getting pregnant and and then this person goes off and en you tnd you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and 

Recording: (2729/ 10720) 
he admits now that he felt neglected at that period 

Recording: (2730/ 10720) 
lipped me out 

Recording: (2731/ 10720) 
then move on maybe somebody else does and that is way i am going to be you know and and like i said she can clean up and look like a beauty queen but yhou can also look just like h you know just basically you know like she was raking leaves ten minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect and i just think that is sort of shallow because you know i look at people who got it youknow they have to have the face lift and they got to have the perfect hair and they got to hae the perfect clothes it is like you are so insecure about the 

Recording: (2732/ 10720)

i uh his wife is a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information uh that he works with well i think she may be uh retired last year but she had  top columbus for cwenty years or something like that and so i think his information is good but i guess  the way he handles things sometimes gets tr

i think there is a hecko lot more to it than what we will probably ever know uh you know theyre theyr really have not checked into the background of the parents you knowwe to what their boliefs were and everything uh and i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something axcidentally happening an tn where some kids shoots another kid you know and hen the parents are ore responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wonte to kill more than what they killed

uh and he had been through a counseling experience before and he they he just played along with it then to get w out of it i think but 

Recording: (3056/ 10720) 
and uh it did not hurt me not you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you know ats your neighborhoods your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood yeven you know how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had gocarts we had many bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3057/ 10720) 
historically you know my dad is people were democrats but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed to purn republican i guess but uh you know there is there some of the conservative values that are very important to me you know but then there ise some social things that are real important too so 

Recording: (3058/ 10720) 
no ias it was kind of disturbing actually 

Recording: (3059/ 10720) 
i make them do their webbing and get their rough draft started and then they can go to the computer because they i find they they are a little more creative when they get the think about adding pictures and we call it publishing it when you get to the publishing stage

Recording: (3072/ 10720) 
have a very general u opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the he total destruction of our center cities uh and i say when i speak of centera cities i do not necessarily mean ju citiesis the size of columbas whi whirsj is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washington court house which maybe have fifteen thousand or

Recording: (3079/ 10720)

and and that split second i was like okay he is going o do this to me he is going to do his to my kids 

Recording: (3081/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (3082/ 10720) 
u 

Recording: (3083/ 10720) 
um yeah across the street s of dental and the hospital so people were really loued down there 

Recording: (3084/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3085/ 10720) 
things o that maternal milk why can not you insteadof get tingof the shelf 

Recording: (3086/ 10720) 
eei am not very good 

Recording: (3087/ 10720) 
i got oneer 

Recording: (3088/ 10720) 
o 

Recording: (3089/ 10720) 
well um my uh grandmother was uh ill 

Recording: (3090/ 10720) 
um e v about the same number 

Recording: (3091/ 10720) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (3092/ 10720) 
ell i tat starts with with allowing uh hether has two mommies 

Recording: (3093/ 10720) 
uhand they are less hiper about like you know bad thing for people to do you know the the drinking the smoking theyere is not as strict about it basically 

Recording: (3094/ 10720) 
it kind of yeah well i have seen worser o um so im and they are doing this i think it is called sit angd reach where he is got to sit on the floor and he is got to raise his feet up just so and and he is got to take his hands and reach towards his tos and he they do that for you know lake five minutes the first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (3095/ 10720) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked but i arranged my life around her so that even tog i had that degree i wait at tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches 

Recording: (3096/ 10720) 
motherly instinct towards you know oh and they arel like old eric you should have one and you know and he knows im kve one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (3097/ 10720) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to thim because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times and you make an erer and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh you know like there is an air plan ovethere and i tell you to turn that way and i really ment for you  turn left and sta right and you may come back and go uh do you do you mean left or right there and i go yes it is correct  turn left you know youkhw so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kindness goes a long way and the pilot is the same way theyh most often 

Recording: (3098/ 10720) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (3099/ 10720) 
and uh he let me fire one  month range but i got about fifty or seventy five yards from the what we were shooting at 

Recording: (3100/ 10720) 
playing around with my lenuxs you kw 

Recording: (3101/ 10720) 
really 

Recording: (3102/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3103/ 10720) 
ts like we do not have one at home because we are worried at that 

Recording: (3104/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3105/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3106/ 10720) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want m you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about you know i mean whatis to prevent them from going inand finding out what some company is doing what research is and that is a that is a threat on the weab too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you 

Recording: (3107/ 10720) 
hum 

Recording: (3108/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (3109/ 10720) 
i did not know about 

Recording: (3110/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (3111/ 10720) 
tho i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because o know 

Recording: (3112/ 10720) 
em 

Recording: (3113/ 10720) 
oh my gosh it is one oft they o not like you know falling out of trees 

Recording: (3114/ 10720) 
would not have even stopped he is sitting there going what are you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested me and he took my neckless tried to take my radio too and uh ou know i kind of through that in there and make it sound bad but i was on my way to work i mean i did not want anything bad to happen to me or him you know so all an all the cop you know put the guy and handcouffs put him back  he car  becase well do you want to press charges 

Recording: (3115/ 10720) 
um i am a loithern and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3116/ 10720) 
wheln my son started yeah my son started public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social child we will say he is the one that talks too much as the teacher say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs the time to run around but he needs something very structured youe get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play 

Recording: (3117/ 10720) 
this it is it is in a ta shape and te thi side of the building all the sound just rolles right up the wall and this trash track made so much stink ang noise it is ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i did not i i developed uh i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that is that is one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because  because there is no noise there is 

Recording: (3118/ 10720) 
so it i it is been very difficult for us particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was between the time my fatherinlaw died and my motherinlaw died which was in a five month period so my wife is had a lot lot to deal with uh and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (3119/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3120/ 10720) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to um enforce that so 

Recording: (3121/ 10720) 
hopefully 

Recording: (3122/ 10720) 
yeah and it is just 

Recording: (3123/ 10720) 
so

Recording: (3194/ 10720) 
like trying to cram organic into my head and 

Recording: (3195/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (3196/ 10720) 
do they have like these big lecture halls over there too 

Recording: (3197/ 10720) 
really you w afraid we are going to get them addicted to the internet or something you now because the men tend to the newse type of things are bad enough they are a good babysitter but you need to limit it 

Recording: (3198/ 10720) 
a little bit yeah

Recording: (3204/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3205/ 10720) 
that is why they have such sarp sharp clas i guess won they can lock in eve man when this you t when those hit your head that would hurt  comocasi cawalais 

Recording: (3206/ 10720) 
some bleading so we had to go back to the hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was and this was not unusual it a horrible period and uh i think what made my wife and i the angry ist was ha he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (3207/ 10720) 
no no no no no i mean she is a she is a great person she is a good chrstian but there ire some things about her that i would not want no wife  aksna on that but uhm i have been single since uh probably march and i am probably going to stay that way for a while mainly because i do not like anybod nolbe y likes me i like it that way i do not 

Recording: (3208/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (3209/ 10720) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (3210/ 10720) 
it 

Recording: (3211/ 10720) 
and some of that is controled with medication now but not all of it because  because of the drug and alcohol they will not put him on some of the medication so but as far as i can tell he is been pretty clear and clean on that and uh you know  once she got prignant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to the pycologist and u uh we have been paying for it but we do lnot have a problem with that because he is going  he likes the 

Recording: (3212/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3213/ 10720) 
oh yeah i have no idea 

Recording: (3214/ 10720) 
like that whare divided people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting ro versus weight and not and in protecting choice you know  um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gor campain theyare i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and a that if you want to protect that right you have got 

Recording: (3215/ 10720) 
and it is like i i like howfick i thought about going to antiock but it was it was really expensive and like um i do not know but just because it is that and an schools more of uh nontraditional uh typeware they give you like avaluations and you do not get grades like and so so then it that is what i that i wha i heard it is like in antiock where the professor rites uh like a couple page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that i man that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved in noticing what 

Recording: (3216/ 10720) 
umhum yeah yeah 

Recording: (3217/ 10720) 
northland mall 

Recording: (3218/ 10720) 
because they kicked me out for some dum reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking the blame 

Recording: (3219/ 10720) 
part of the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in datan came out with one that said america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just 

Recording: (3220/ 10720) 
no not at all i would have rather voteed for mackayan over bush because bush he he comes from a political family whichi am not saying is wrong because the kenedies were a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really likee everything is been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if you did drugs okay everyone 

Recording: (3221/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3222/ 10720) 
so i started watching hem  got i i do not wan t say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the painting  i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective uh so it is like my first couple of years at college uh from sort of the second half i high school to my first couple of years at college i just sort of just how n

Recording: (3229/ 10720) 
it is moreo our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (3230/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (3231/ 10720) 
h like uh say going to ohair they will you wil have to call for release times to these different air ports and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like at twenty seven past the hour so he they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is air lines that cause it themself it is like uh you know like you and iy and five hundred people want to get to this room uh ten oclock today well rather than say 

Recording: (3232/ 10720) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like te design iam maybe a designer but you know like i went to uh i i was in police i uh law enforcement

Recording: (3236/ 10720) 
you know he says that he equels mc squared i say it is eequles mc cubed because  the world is three dimentional it is not two dimentional uh two dimentional limits everything but you look at his theory relativity all of our mathmatial therims physical theorims on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (3237/ 10720) 
rih 

Recording: (3238/ 10720) 
plays and like like just things that are different and like my sociology and pychology teacher were wre real he  he was the same guy taught historyn he was real good too like it was really crazy obviously but like it is just like interesting um like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about it you know just 

Recording: (3239/ 10720) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3240/ 10720)

it was it was specially it was my job but  as you know the parents always get stuck  i have a brother 

Recording: (3242/ 10720) 
yeaw because i mean five years went by like 

Recording: (3243/ 10720) 
um i guess that would be slightly different part of men i am not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (3244/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (3245/ 10720)

Recording: (3252/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (3253/ 10720) 
and socially too i mean mostly ach d and ld kids are emotionally immature as well so like the songs that their friends are listening to and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they are still acting like a fifth grader you know they are not interested in girls and they are still listening to music that younger kids would like they are just generally socially they mature a little slower takes them longer to catch up

Recording: (3255/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (3256/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (3257/ 10720) 
yeah yeah yeah i should not have to do this i am not responsible for the happiness of this family 

Recording: (3258/ 10720) 
and they used to have the lazer lite show down town they they do not have anymore um you know just even if you do one thing free a month

Recording: (3261/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3262/ 10720) 
well i mean most of it was me going over it with em and just you know i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and you know just doing the things that worked for him and as an individual 

Recording: (3263/ 10720) 
mum 

Recording: (3264/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3265/ 10720) 
yeah and then when hey did the blood test they found out i had highper tension plus cartivascular diseases had notthing to do with drugs 

Recording: (3266/ 10720) 
there is so much negativity on the national news i do not know if it will just be bunted in or if people will associate that with collumbus 

Recording: (3267/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3268/ 10720) 
but like if you said i we will have a buss service we will go and pick your guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them a like does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you are runing three shifts you cauln just you know here is a box of donuts and some milk or something you know and that does not cost the company that much becan 

Recording: (3269/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3270/ 10720) 
r whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are dhefinitely a separate budget and you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital businesses struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that 

Recording: (3271/ 10720) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are going ta have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (3272/ 10720) 
we really that is awsome 

Recording: (3273/ 10720)

Recording: (3387/ 10720) 
at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play  and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody

that is an embarrassment for a college this size 

Recording: (3389/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (3390/ 10720) 
and that the the the people who who most face that ly are the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation um so u i mean civil rights was ana an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today there are are uh i mean  i see a a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and 

Recording: (3391/ 10720) 
um actually odly enough that is what i am putting in

Recording: (3401/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (3402/ 10720) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefit it a lot from it now 

Recording: (3403/ 10720) 
yeah yeah yep yeah so 

Recording: (3404/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (3405/ 10720)

if if you did not own let us say on a school leve and you j  you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset ad i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built in to the rent uh at least it is it ought to be or i have a pretty dum landlord  uh and i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after a school levey passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levey was uh so that would be the first thing

Recording: (3421/ 10720)

Recording: (3569/ 10720) 
yeah it is i like it 

Recording: (3570/ 10720) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school than you know just recently i guess it was not in the bige numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kidshave died even more than you know seven or whatever and i think that the media is just made it into something at they have glamorized it and some of the kids i think

Recording: (3643/ 10720) 
i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because the do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain uh that was why tomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but

andi was threatening kids with it and so they suspended him 

Recording: (3719/ 10720) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you would run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids have the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (3720/ 10720)

Recording: (3996/ 10720) 
well they pretty much put by the test schors they do not sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we arend they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting to know the student what the student still needs for the completion of that grade and once they figure that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder 

Recording: (3997/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (3998/ 10720)

Recording: (4005/ 10720) 
no becaus they are going to learn that on their own um i i personally think that it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are home sexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and bobbelbloc because but i have also known people that were that way and now are haderr sexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they 

Recording: (4006/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4007/ 10720) 
h 

Recording: (4008/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (4009/ 10720) 
yeah i canot we 

Recording: (4010/ 10720) 
well i what what what neighborhood do you live in because uh you know i see asians and indians and all everywhere but boy they do not live on my street 

Recording: (4011/ 10720) 
yeah i think so um met quite a few people from cleaveland and then my roommateis from north canton 

Recording: (4012/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4013/ 10720) 
i have to think ave some words there but you know since everybody is just making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal yeah 

Recording: (4014/ 10720) 
uh my stepmother is 

Recording: (4015/ 10720) 
they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not of working age they get like a an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they are provide they are the top of the list for a councel house so they get there own there was actually a long document around before i left um you know of this girl who is constantly fighting with her parents 

Recording: (4016/ 10720) 
schoolboard they are always stopping something and they do not seem to move forward very well 

Recording: (4017/ 10720) 
hat woul be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (4018/ 10720) 
you know they want to be judges like everybody else but i you know i think um they have so many different ideas and not that either one of them is right but still u i i think there is always going ta barrior there they are just kids aare just not all kids are going to get along you know i mean 

Recording: (4019/ 10720) 
um yeah i just realize hat like di donot know it is just different than i thought so if i im not happy in a place like i should not stay and just be miserable about it 

Recording: (4020/ 10720) 
and so it it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that willing to say i just can not make those he wul let he ol let my daughter who is thr he left left her at the movies one night they went to the movies there was no um the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not going to start until nine thirty which means his kid is twelve years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve  you know at the lenex he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and althoughis tomboy who is just amazing but so anyhow he 

Recording: (4021/ 10720) 
my god 

Recording: (4022/ 10720) 
and i think that unfortunately  spend a lot of your time trying to get out of out of personal issues that you have gotten yourself into and you can not really focus on anything that is that is positive that you want to do for for ther country and i think i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was president not that i want to be president but you know you would have three or four things that you would think were very important you would you would hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that youwoul fel like they would actually be able to accomplish some things and you would really work to get some 

Recording: (4023/ 10720)

Recording: (4042/ 10720) 
interactive they are 

Recording: (4043/ 10720) 
a little abrupt for me and he says well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you caun die and all thes stuff and is at waiht of bit a i   you know  sitd oun ready for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is gone really well i mean i just i and i know we just finished our lamas classes last night and there are some women in there they are huge i mean these girls can not even get off the floor and i just feel really backfor them so for me it is it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems

Recording: (4051/ 10720) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know becauseu i guess that is because that is what happens to a lot of them mean they they come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming tyhey make opper management there is you want the tax break you want thing you know what i mean and then they like i have an uncle he is a vice president on wallstreet for marlinch and he said you know he goet out of school nd e is very idealistic but now he

Recording: (4055/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (4056/ 10720) 
not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have gotten oller too i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important any more

the front door and it was only he and i in the office you know and every once in awhile his wife would be in there and i just i lost it i was i i was mad but i did not want him to think that i was afraid i wanted tob him to be afraid of me so i just i stomped back to my desk and i said oh great i said not only are you apaying to work without to be afraide of you and then i think i did scare him because he started you know he backed off a lot and just his personality and his his and then that that was a

Recording: (4211/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (4212/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (4213/ 10720) 
but if you love the if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also and other woards you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not going to leti get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that deer but and i love you dearly but i try to teach you differntly do not know where you went wrong in do not want to did wrong a what ever but you got to pay the penalty

oh and o they do not care they got money t people that got down 

Recording: (4218/ 10720) 
the birth control issue became so personal and um it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with it what i felt was a clear conscience and what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (4219/ 10720) 
i guess almost sat i ways sure i wish they would celebrate every holiday so then they are exposed to all of it instead of none of it 

Recording: (4220/ 10720) 
catholic high schools but even there you know there was you know ah a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not have been going on and that was only on a very small lever there were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students that this happened at so 

Recording: (4221/ 10720) 
are growing up we push all this in you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait until those kids grow up and and wait until those people 

Recording: (4222/ 10720) 
but um 

Recording: (4223/ 10720) 
oh really 

Recording: (4224/ 10720) 
i think there is been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking them away from the othere cousins i mean they have the cousins have been stressing all i mean he needs family he needs sothink well there is not much closer family than your father and  tha t they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you agree with them or not uh i i 

Recording: (4225/ 10720) 
so he will not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4226/ 10720)

Recording: (4233/ 10720) 
although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people praying and they are praying with their heart and i tell you because of how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart not a bunch of real fancy words a in a real comfortable setting you know that that heat 

Recording: (4234/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (4235/ 10720) 
um i have not personally researched it but i have seen um i would personally research it if i was precident um documentaries and whatnot and things on twenty twenty which i do not wholehartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes and you are out has really seemed to work in california because

i hope so yeah 

Recording: (4243/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (4244/ 10720) 
well i think uh han my opinion i think main mainly the uh  it is the absence of uh basically parenting you know uh my mom was there u she was a housewife you knoh and uh so she was she went to work after i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother and all my brothers and sisters are already graduated you know so 

Recording: (4245/ 10720) 
i do not think that would change my mind about anything i mean i do not approve of his immoral behavior but it does not change the way he runs the country 

Recording: (4246/ 10720) 
i did get better grades last nine weeks did not i well it is not that amazing you were taking your bills then some connection here  so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let us just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we will rite them down and say oh well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all this nine weeks that you have not been able to focus on that maybe that isin does help you some maybe you are just you know not giving it credit 

Recording: (4247/ 10720)

umhum 

Recording: (4253/ 10720)

Recording: (4254/ 10720) 
well not really they uh have a lot of um religious beliefs in their own that they have had held on to because um they just have had nothing

Recording: (4256/ 10720) 
sara 

Recording: (4257/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (4258/ 10720) 
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (4259/ 10720) 
i have become visually dcensitized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather grewsome events in history that still are very i still find disturbing u uhuh also hang out in low life 

Recording: (4260/ 10720) 
i think that step would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4261/ 10720)

Recording: (4269/ 10720) 
and uh you know it is oh wehae got or we are opened to that you know

Recording: (4273/ 10720) 
you know but you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is twenty two i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to look for a perever what you need to look for what you need to check out and you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work study job  you know 

Recording: (4274/ 10720) 
really 

Recording: (4275/ 10720) 
uh poor people can not do that um so after all was said and knon with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that million the attorney and the firm got a third plus she had to pay office expenses so really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars which if used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person uh but a very stupid person 

Recording: (4276/ 10720) 
wenty one million dollar check to hit the the door stup you know 

Recording: (4277/ 10720)

men 

Recording: (4289/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4290/ 10720) 
you know or uh conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my here is my dog my labradoor uh yeah full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting ind uh they were objective you know and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were o pissing on the carpet and making messes and juneg things up and 

Recording: (4291/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (4292/ 10720) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the east side and then you got all these people you know i have been in the fights in my neighborhood and well my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out outlandish behavior i mean i caught i actually wrode up on uh couple people

y 

Recording: (4294/ 10720) 
yeah she still live with the amily 

Recording: (4295/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4296/ 10720) 
ell i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun and waiys around the school you know that is the big thing now but just the you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support cleaw up through the administration and if they do have a they have to wait until something is pretty pretty agregieous before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (4297/ 10720) 
hol all focuse changes it really does 

Recording: (4298/ 10720) 
well i think all through growing up there is always been you know different kind of kids 

Recording: (4299/ 10720) 
um yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up with drawing because i would have like failed everything anyway but um yeah then i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like know  now me and her and my other friend live in down on mainor 

Recording: (4300/ 10720) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of you know america just being like the country of excess like excess posestions xcess food excess weight excess money you know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back and you know thiss i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland yeurope and 

Recording: (4301/ 10720) 
by 

Recording: (4302/ 10720) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how to how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have uh a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picknic like in the practice football field and thait was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spend in second half of the day just hanging outnd so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know 

Recording: (4303/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (4304/ 10720) 
doing the eleventh ad doing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this sniffty little thing called an attendantes cirtificut it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (4305/ 10720) 
uh i think they losti think o or state losst because they was just out there renting and raving and after a while  got out of hand an oh 

Recording: (4306/ 10720) 
ae actually been on dubs u also uh radio on music in mid ohio uh ore recording last year yeah of baythoven is ninth got on music in mid ohio  yeah we used tho auterbine college quire hm 

Recording: (4307/ 10720) 
i do not know i and i do not know if it was drugs or s something ridiculous  that that a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force and a lot of other officials are are pretty much an agreement that he should resign and he feels like like he is just not going to and that we do not have any um that the mayor can not nobody can actually make him resigne that that is something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as you know dorthe was teeter was saying i am going to make him do this which is something that 

Recording: (4308/ 10720) 
ell when i was a senior in high school i wish my parents would have pushed me to do something practical but i am glad they did not because it gave me a chance to make my own decision 

Recording: (4309/ 10720) 
oh no 

Recording: (4310/ 10720) 
i do not know i men i think it is kind of ridiculous for kids to pay to choe gumb you know or if they get caught chewing like desales my all my cousins went to th dsales and if they got shut caught chewing gum they have the pay 

Recording: (4311/ 10720) 
well like um i knew uh one of my friend is from sunbery it was uh because cat does a lot of acting stuff and like um my one friend uh knew knew her like they did plays together like down at like collumbus junior theater or something and like that is i so like um that is whow we got introduced to whatever and then  jus been friends for a while couple couple f years yeah 

Recording: (4312/ 10720) 
of the people of this land tat there is in a a seramony called an inipie which is a sweat lodge and a lot of people talk about sweat lodge um it involves heating up stones in a fire and uh putting the stones in the lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs it is not a sonna it is not a uh steame room 

Recording: (4313/ 10720) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rigihts and the uh affermative action programs and the bussing did to people as going to turn people against uh gays like they turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who as very active in the sixties 

Recording: (4314/ 10720) 
s once a turrist heare about it you know it is like younw 

Recording: (4315/ 10720) 
um i mean they did not really do anything too extensive on it that they basically as far as religion classes go they wd basically told what the catholic church believed about it and how they felt about it but i mean they did not really condem or support it or anything like that i mean they they basically did realize that it is more up to the person i mean 

Recording: (4316/ 10720) 
oh okay okay uh yeah as far as the ciblines go burney is uh does charitable work

Recording: (4321/ 10720)

nowthose people do not want to take time nowadays it is easier just to ge a kid a beaper 

Recording: (4345/ 10720) 
think the main problem with this year was the coaching it is good that they got rid of two coaches but his attitude i just do not think the kids think of him as a role model and i think a coach has to be a role model i used to work at the highet on capital square 

Recording: (4346/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (4347/ 10720)

everybody is coastill but us 

Recording: (4353/ 10720) 
as uh uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what her moral beliefs were 

Recording: (4354/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (4355/ 10720) 
and getting back to the profanity and stuff that was another one was in the paper some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something all once theire little kid maybe six or seven or eight walked inn there and said what the ech d you know four letter word is this for and the father stannd lookd at ton and after the kids walked out and says morere well where ind the ah do that child learn to talk like that so yoeu see he gave himself away right away so  you see it is the it is the ones that are teaching the kids and itis it is all 

Recording: (4356/ 10720)

Recording: (4364/ 10720)

Recording: (4366/ 10720)

Recording: (4368/ 10720) 
he is really justt yeah he does not think through the implications that things real well in his personal lif

less in america than they 

Recording: (4373/ 10720) 
they are a major influence because wou were talking about numbers and you are talking about uh a great uh grater inter communication i would like to go back one step where we are talking about when i made mention thet three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we arem nearing zero in terms of global

Recording: (4377/ 10720) 
yeah half tank gas

from family  yea umhum oh yeah yeah but something i have learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i you know talk to is that you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of uh in your home type of thing an 

Recording: (4416/ 10720) 
um i mean i feel uh i leaned toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for starilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human right side was that if they are you know on

i i guess i  like to do  but and i probably i do not know 

Recording: (4428/ 10720) 
i know that is why you have to get it recorded  i it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they are on a shoe string they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count in kind contribution the wester uh auterboin college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and uh the salary the conductor uh 

Recording: (4429/ 10720) 
pretty much anywhere in delaware that i can find 

Recording: (4430/ 10720)

Recording: (4431/ 10720) 
i mean i obviously that is a long ways off um i i i guess i immagine i would be teaching in public schools so hopefully i could try to get toto where i was but but i i i do not know i mean maybe i do not know is that i i do not even know if iis dubling really better thn then columbus public or 

Recording: (4432/ 10720)

yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was  high schooli wen to i mean i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (4435/ 10720) 
like a double standard for black people there are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racus towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously there are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not want to deal with uh i mean it is basically the same thing umhum really

Recording: (4441/ 10720) 
i mean we throw the book away on some of these other guys i mean they throw the kee away on some of these guys and you know we want to set them n as an example and you know thire is one guy had one dui two years ago so whe really have he is got to be in jail for five years you know then this judge i mean he is got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he is still and he is still a judge  monday morning he goes to work

Recording: (4444/ 10720) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think a at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children b how many accidents happen to children like peple aways breaking arms and stuff

Recording: (4450/ 10720) 
and not actually incorporateed in a thirty student onsambo um uh it would be nice if we had more of an open environment schools thand if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talked to them about it and then send them on that counceling went on one way um just because if you are going to teach it to a a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest i em would probably be making cracks 

Recording: (4451/ 10720)

Recording: (4575/ 10720) 
is that right 

Recording: (4576/ 10720) 
now because of the children she worries about the children and bububu b you know so it is better just to gom so i know what they are doing and everything but i do not i am not the old fashioned grandmother 

Recording: (4577/ 10720) 
they go she is got it and they on to thenext guy and then all of a suden you are going aoff this woye they go uh that is nice juliet uh where are you going and you are like uh uh youh tol me uo and then they go oh brother you know so now you know attention is diverted to you so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there realy professional yeah and 

Recording: (4578/ 10720) 
no  no 

Recording: (4579/ 10720) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (4580/ 10720) 
hum 

Recording: (4581/ 10720) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger morgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (4582/ 10720) 
well it is not that there his been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (4583/ 10720) 
or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realize the background and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save half of them it is better than 

Recording: (4584/ 10720) 
a have uh five hour course the first term of sume recorder

Recording: (4695/ 10720) 
just kind of moved yer a little bit uyeahuh i got a service my parents were uh older and uh kind of fheught an obbligation to be around them to help take care of them stuff 

Recording: (4696/ 10720) 
i mean i i was very goodi math um very good math i mean i was i did pretty good in all of the subjects 

Recording: (4697/ 10720) 
but it does not always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment tho the guy that they uh uh executed here in ohio last fall did you know about it you 

Recording: (4698/ 10720) 
that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peeris opinions because i i for one example the pokimon crase my son did not know what pokimon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know 

Recording: (4699/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4700/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4701/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (4702/ 10720) 
definitely it would be nice but no um 

Recording: (4703/ 10720) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4704/ 10720) 
i have keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know have because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young im five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking eleven years old 

Recording: (4705/ 10720) 
yeah and he is got control over that because i i mean he was going to a different baby sitter a woman um that baby sits and she did very very well she did all that stuff that i would like to be done she took thim to the library she had nappd time at a certain time therer and you know lay down and that is just totally different  uh at the grandmother is 

Recording: (4706/ 10720) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (4707/ 10720) 
you know and i just thought i just do not i just do not like this is not so is thist something that when i look along terms of something that i want to do whath for the rest of my life ind i i know it just does not you know and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible with somebody before you know people get into situations and they marry people that you just you from the outside you can look and you can think are your not you know that is never going to wear you know so i think that you just kind tof have to take into consideration you know are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to that is going to work and be positive 

Recording: (4708/ 10720) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (4709/ 10720) 
i i i would find that hard to believe 

Recording: (4710/ 10720) 
h 

Recording: (4711/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4712/ 10720) 
i would say of uh i think the the the vva generally sees on the average five seven ten something like that a day ar not all of them homeless 

Recording: (4713/ 10720) 
you know 

Recording: (4714/ 10720) 
she said that it is like i  know some people wharre work there like i could not imagine working like complete nights you know i mean i like working two thirty two eleven i think i would rather work like maybe like noon to eight that would be better because then it is like i mean i am more tone to staying up late anyway is just because of  like howitis or whatever but like i do not want to have to get up really early either like i coald never imagine having a nine to five job like that would be horrible 

Recording: (4715/ 10720) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (4716/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (4717/ 10720) 
the government is always good for money 

Recording: (4718/ 10720) 
is  but it was interesting uh they did have uh assemblies where they they had religious assemblies uh religion was not uh all  it was not all invasive in this school but they did have assemblies and uh for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking uh it is 

Recording: (4719/ 10720) 
umhum umhum it uh t it was like i say i say   she proby probably thinks the same way y knowif she would been here you know nt having trouble with boys and everything you know when she is growing up i o paby would uh could have probably would have been an ass abot that kind of stuff yo depending on o how bad 

Recording: (4720/ 10720) 
um it is pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part um not so much the getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (4721/ 10720) 
ell we were we were not that o we were in vancover so it is not that far away we did not hear about it for a couple of days but i heard that that is all that was on every aspect of his life every aspect of the search what do people really need to know that do they need to have a driven home and i think then and i think at that point that is where the media are just they are sensationalizeing it and 

Recording: (4722/ 10720) 
to the other side 

Recording: (4723/ 10720) 
is a law that u uh you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me for so i came it back into collumbus and it is a lot harder to work in collumbus public but but uh i i know the territory i know where i am going 

Recording: (4724/ 10720) 
anoh i think i thrive on stress  i think it keeps me uh going or something but i do have to do something that is accomplishing something i do not want to sit in an office i have already done that day and and day out working for other people that i do not even approve of that are making way too much money anyway you know and fter 

Recording: (4725/ 10720)

yes 

Recording: (4732/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4733/ 10720) 
i started at the real bottom of it 

Recording: (4734/ 10720) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (4735/ 10720) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that is the big meal of the day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (4736/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4737/ 10720)

oh they were helping out the the new guys 

Recording: (4745/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4746/ 10720)

Recording: (4757/ 10720) 
intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bring about the spirituality and tha person that is gong to carry them all through life she is also uh tithing more than tithing probably which uh i always uh kiddwith people i said the author  said ten percent tithing knew inflation he knew great about economics ten percent andis ten percent and 

Recording: (4758/ 10720)

Recording: (4759/ 10720) 
well and i think it really it still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy you know would i act this way would that make my mom and because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know  well an they learn by watching you do it too i mean my

Recording: (4777/ 10720) 
yeah we did we had uh um they areclled land parties there parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook them up to into a network ad then you play games

all right 

Recording: (4780/ 10720) 
so you knew you have heard about that probably 

Recording: (4781/ 10720) 
y 

Recording: (4782/ 10720) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much ra system as whereas if you are my superviser i am just using it as an example and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4783/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4784/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (4785/ 10720) 
that is that is going to be a problem they said bring bring water you are going to definitely like they have no dress cot which is nice so i am just going to wear shorts some good walking shoes and a and a tenshirt because it coul get rough it coul get real rough i bet 

Recording: (4786/ 10720)

Recording: (4787/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (4788/ 10720) 
i think it would help i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people 

Recording: (4789/ 10720) 
now like i toll her is a whay i was raised 

Recording: (4790/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4791/ 10720) 
always had these uh spuiral notbooks and she wou stop and get an idea for a poem maybe from something she gos working alot or i do not know what but but anyway uh she  she wrote quite a few poems some of them real good poetry i thought most of them of more or less a religious nature ind moral naturein 

Recording: (4792/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (4793/ 10720) 
so she is doing that and uh 

Recording: (4794/ 10720) 
yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4795/ 10720) 
u 

Recording: (4796/ 10720) 
ah i do think there is some and i do not think they would probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they would probably be exposed to you know the gaylas being i i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth you know about sex and your sexed classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i do not know or friends that have a eleven year old that is going to public schools i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (4797/ 10720) 
not at all  he is always had very definite opinions of how his life should be 

Recording: (4798/ 10720) 
ohyeah 

Recording: (4799/ 10720) 
rmat to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so uh i did not want to go into law  did not want to go into pairoflegal i was looking into that and lady kept hounding me and telling me you know uh maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like why would i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crat you know i see a lyer i bring them

like 

Recording: (4801/ 10720) 
youdonot 

Recording: (4802/ 10720) 
dusso i do not know i i think a lot of it is the family unit breaking down in general you know and secondly i think to be honest i think the media is gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it um and i do think  you know they know they are going to get recognized they are going to have their name go down in history unfortunately um i think that has something to do with it too um it is frustrating to 

Recording: (4803/ 10720) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (4804/ 10720) 
i see i mean you see the computer can not be wrong he said 

Recording: (4805/ 10720) 
too much 

Recording: (4806/ 10720) 
no i we actually hade student tickets that people that went clear up on cedeck um but we enjoy it because  lot of times we walk and 

Recording: (4807/ 10720) 
oh because u some of the newer wjets there is like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it is there are prop planes that are like five times as noisy 

Recording: (4808/ 10720)

Recording: (4810/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (4811/ 10720) 
some of them are athletes they are pretty much just preppy student councel i am good at school but bad outside of school they go out aind party outside of school but they join all like the students against drugs programs

yeah exactly that will solve the problem 

Recording: (4822/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (4823/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4824/ 10720) 
they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if uf if a kid has bad behavior or you know bad attendence that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shop lifting boying you know  hot wiring 

Recording: (4825/ 10720)

oh yeah they showed they cut openar pulling this baby out of this little hole of this lady is stomac and i just uh i had heart surgery when i was younger and so i have had lots of needles and those types of things and i when it comes to needles and and that kind of stuff and just kind of squeamish about it you know so that stuff i just i just do not want to see it 

Recording: (4828/ 10720) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (4829/ 10720) 
of the year i mean it just got to the point where i would had enough and i did not want to go anymore 

Recording: (4830/ 10720) 
but right now with his attitude the way it is i would say that me and my family are better off not having him sturring up a bunch of conflict or whatever 

Recording: (4831/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4832/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (4833/ 10720) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school b because there were pregnant girls in my high school 

Recording: (4834/ 10720) 
and uh well actually a neighbor boy whose draft number was smaller than mine 

Recording: (4835/ 10720) 
jees something at does not sound right throughthe airwats or through the riding something ti is misterious going on here and you found out there were dt haveeng difficulties well divorce became acceptable before it was a nono now it is acceptable and then you had uh the selebrities becoming more knottm ohhey we do not we do not we donot get married anymore no okay then we have the idea uf doing it away with cash golden meta the mitalik backing i think it was kennedy was not wong i did that 

Recording: (4836/ 10720) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (4837/ 10720) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know af pregnancy here and there r things that people needed toi get worked out or someone being worried about  u a a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with about it so yeah but you know i it is i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (4838/ 10720) 
okay one two three four five testing testing when i was a kid my father got this taper card ind the days when there were those big you know the wheels 

Recording: (4839/ 10720) 
r not yo holding it 

Recording: (4840/ 10720) 
well that is what everybody when i tell people i play it that is what everybody says but it seems to me that any instrument can be had depending i mean i can not see how anybody can play a claranet for example but they are some things that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with a single fingering 

Recording: (4841/ 10720) 
and you uh it is just like the game battle ship pretty much you know a four a to a seven and um well off a three dollar one i have one probably four out of five you know and that i have not bought that many of them but in that rea right dere four out of five i is not too bad got my mom wone on her birthday she got fifteen dollars and 

Recording: (4842/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (4843/ 10720) 
uh maybe maybe i like i said like it is really weird most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit famy because i have lived in ohio for so long but when you are little is whenu i think you learned loyalty like i love the old detroit tigers from the eighties and like that is when i learned to like 

Recording: (4844/ 10720) 
umhum yeah i yeah if it is a nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (4845/ 10720) 
t is alwayis going to be somebody it can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality ind to account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of suup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because 

Recording: (4846/ 10720) 
and they can not find it and and you know ad yhou knw lke all right ht look on the catalog where it says mm number tha thatis that would be your membership number and people ike allright all right but i do not know like i i really do not i really want to get a job that is like in a warehouse or something something really easy where i can just like load boxes or something because like i never have time to really i mean like i try and doi do like ind i try and do youogo but it is like bu we work two thirty to eleven s us like aby the time you get home it is 

Recording: (4847/ 10720) 
yes 

Recording: (4848/ 10720) 
i mean i i i do not know enough about it to really say but it i can not i mean it i do not know where they got that 

Recording: (4849/ 10720) 
she was but id admired her more  because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going to be the lipmius test it was just like back in in the sixties ind the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party they would nominate such people as um mcgouveron who had you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line left 

Recording: (4850/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (4851/ 10720)

Recording: (4871/ 10720) 
yeah yeah and they are also talking about because uh uh the actors the the reason they are ending it is because the actors do not want to do it there was talk i do not know if they are still pursuing this that they would have new characters take over the roles and i mean the character development is the most important part i think um so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that they are going to leave thingis kind of open 

Recording: (4872/ 10720) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leaway  but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an af finity towards certaint students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of uh not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much  yeah yeah 

Recording: (4873/ 10720) 
no 

Recording: (4874/ 10720) 
so they knew that this bush name would bring out a lot of money which it has he is got a lot of money to work with and you know that does not seem fair either i do not think you know the average person in the united states the average person uh does not think that your politicians should be boght you know

Recording: (4882/ 10720) 
so he did it it is well he is always had some problems he oud uh his problems saying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested ind then you can not get him away from it um if it is something hei it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff whene they are trying to teach something in class o r supposed  be working on a writing assignment or something they have a half hour to work oni 

Recording: (4883/ 10720)

Recording: (4888/ 10720) 
umhum it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is agd it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want o believe you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i wld look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and

hot wiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do not know i think i do have sort of very strong opinions about people you know who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all

Recording: (4898/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (4899/ 10720) 
and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and think for myself and so i am exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle that and so uh when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in in a lot of trouble about uh the whole racial thing because uh i am from a school where i was mostly white students were 

Recording: (4900/ 10720) 
yeah yeah and that is the thing about the schools too you know i i totally disagree with uniforms you know unless it is all slacks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms and they are short and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said hey you know  this i you know  have not met me in

and then they are going to say they want to nail their parents you know their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what thay kid s doing 

Recording: (4997/ 10720) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the backroom of the library is connected to and it was all main frame and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world if who could access any system and what they could do ont their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out into the public wook and the public see and do it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the w you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with librari s before now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody 

Recording: (4998/ 10720) 
they know more knowlege i would not say they are more socially mature or more um um i mean there is even sweet little preschool girls that do not say please and thank you you know you have to remind them 

Recording: (4999/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5000/ 10720) 
with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh it is it is a nice  well you could still go it they will not have they will not have a lot of uh

theyhad on the news most people keep a house five to seven years beore they sell it and move on 

Recording: (5005/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (5006/ 10720) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a pychology ingrit so yeah 

Recording: (5007/ 10720) 
um no which is i am very grateful he did like go past my harn parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though it is public records like who owns a house um luckily we have not had that because we purchased the house my husband like before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name on it but uh no luckily 

Recording: (5008/ 10720) 
so it brings that and it is like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the tests at both schools i will bet you they are al about the same 

Recording: (5009/ 10720) 
yah oh now  that is the one you stay away from 

Recording: (5010/ 10720) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain  it is just coming down all over the place hail and lightning 

Recording: (5011/ 10720) 
mean you could probably write about thousand words on a page right now about pychology because of your how many years do you have two three 

Recording: (5012/ 10720) 
ight 

Recording: (5013/ 10720) 
uh forty is like the limit

Recording: (5021/ 10720) 
you know what tiy mean it is uh i mean weare i hope we are getting to the place we know that that uh

i am trying to work on my license for sky diving though umhum 

Recording: (5085/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (5086/ 10720)

Recording: (5089/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5090/ 10720) 
umum he would absolutely have to billd my trust for a long time 

Recording: (5091/ 10720) 
good 

Recording: (5092/ 10720) 
yeah i work on the oxtion up there so i sort of avoid the campt mean campus it is been a long time since i have been around here 

Recording: (5093/ 10720) 
himself and the two elections he ran in um most real democrats the warim baties of the world and many you know congressmen and and senators dislike clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough um i liked clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes and either party do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a modernand 

Recording: (5094/ 10720) 
it was probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (5095/ 10720) 
right after you are done doing all of the shpiel about you know why you think they should accept crist in their life they say okay that is good for you and that is the general that is the general feeling among people  our age our generation i mean what generation are we anyways i am i am i i am twenty so there is like the generation ex theye are the generation right after me and hen there is the generation wy tkay there 

Recording: (5096/ 10720) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in ah setting in school if they had a a man earlyer on rather than having to wait until they are in middle school to relate to a coaach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (5097/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5098/ 10720) 
yeahmu you learned it in a hurry 

Recording: (5099/ 10720) 
th some of the classes i am taking are probably um kind of dangerous though like the fumes from the paints and stuff so i cannot have to wait till those are over yea 

Recording: (5100/ 10720) 
for two bux you know you can not beat that 

Recording: (5101/ 10720) 
umhum umum well you youhave had a good reason to be bothered 

Recording: (5102/ 10720) 
and the people that would be decent parent are not because of the situations and what not um just my nobody my my sister does not have kids i do not have kids where in our midthe late thirties um our friends just had one um i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they are just great parents id not know those kids are going to be going in but then i have uh other people that like my other friends that just had one we are trying to help uh 

Recording: (5103/ 10720) 
and the cops we ne e te of the crist and and now cristmas just near me trying to be near me no idea what tht was going on and  i i this thi sinks in too andas lik you you do not you do they tell an do you do you s i have no idea what is going on oh and i could not do anything about im i could not tell thim i could not communicate i was totally incapale  yeah and 

Recording: (5104/ 10720) 
for everybody so you you want to go to iv leage yo do not even want to look here 

Recording: (5105/ 10720) 
i mean my the middle brother was always around he was not very social in high school so 

Recording: (5106/ 10720) 
caun see itat think he c he cou be ducked of them you knowyo seventy seven years old i can not imagine being hurt by him you know 

Recording: (5107/ 10720) 
yeah you can not say a nown is always going to be orange and it is going ta be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than mathan cience so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at 

Recording: (5108/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5109/ 10720) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to would probably be more towards the education line 

Recording: (5110/ 10720) 
surewell that and they like tuesday when we weere blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and i i was reading a book and i let her out and i let her back in and i started reading again and i am looking aroun and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know u you live here it is not that big of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak

well you need 

Recording: (5125/ 10720) 
uh you know uh this freedom semi quasi freedom there is an ellusion of freedom and a reality of freedom uh and the indian people know the big difference of that 

Recording: (5126/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5127/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5128/ 10720) 
right and you can get te walking down the street 

Recording: (5129/ 10720) 
i am sure you played with ittoo 

Recording: (5130/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5131/ 10720) 
there did not used to be inspecially in restaurants and everything and now it is such a open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um body is taste you know i mean before know i would have to go into a restaurant anto saland baked potator you know i mean there is nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffe and then all the foods so cooked down i mean honestly you know it is like no nutritional value 

Recording: (5132/ 10720) 
um he is still in columbus he is uh he is like uh he is like some sort of in  some sort of bsiness i do not understand business whatsoever yeah that is all i know i i it is it is lost on me so i am sorry i am not i do not have that i do not have a finance head so

right across from the courthouse yeah yeah 

Recording: (5134/ 10720) 
or the festivals in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are those are really great and they are you know i mean they are they are crowded but they are peaceful you know there is not there is not rieting in the streets and there is a lot to do and great you know great music 

Recording: (5135/ 10720) 
ut see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like the the yeuropeans do i think i guess because e yuropeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they get the thrainse that the eural chrains and the busses and and and and just like he but just by personal car you can go you know across just going across the border you thinka they can go visit uh you know countries like like it is so condensed but here it is like we got arosians and it is like we got tof like fli so so that 

Recording: (5136/ 10720) 
because conceivably they wanted  what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (5137/ 10720) 
umum 

Recording: (5138/ 10720) 
yes 

Recording: (5139/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5140/ 10720)

Recording: (5141/ 10720) 
checking to see what kind of things you are ordering where your hits are on the inner net and 

Recording: (5142/ 10720) 
eah you really do yeah 

Recording: (5143/ 10720) 
um i do not think that really matters honestly um i mean it is i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you are usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like and do not like um i can not see i can not see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being too 

Recording: (5144/ 10720) 
most tove 

Recording: (5145/ 10720) 
casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice uh you know gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the the folly of the ways and dying in the classic um tragic hero sort of way um and so i am looking forward to how they build up to that point um a lot of people inas in high school the what the hel are youre talking about bouh but uh u yeah i am looking forward to seeing how things 

Recording: (5146/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (5147/ 10720) 
o

be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sxty two and it is yeah it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle that has nothing in it just it is just empty space over the over the worchip center so when you would sing in that as a clirryou spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go allll the way to the back but if you were under this flat ceiling

Recording: (5183/ 10720)

Recording: (5191/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5192/ 10720) 
think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister is wet stinky hair because it smelled of cigarete smoke for some reason so wet stinky hair weat because i was crying into it and um and then more time passes so so i m in indeterminate length of time later um i i look over at the police officer who is standing on one side and the coups are there basically to make sure i do not freak out and that is finally slunk in nd it was like the cups are here so you do not freak i am like i am not really in any danger of freaking out ad 

Recording: (5193/ 10720)

Recording: (5207/ 10720) 
it was mostly cokasian and very few asian and other ethnicidies 

Recording: (5208/ 10720) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh jon kennedy died 

Recording: (5209/ 10720) 
oh man 

Recording: (5210/ 10720) 
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up you know uh a lot of the nurses even who were former attics you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they were not doing following protocall and of course me i would be the ones saying hey you are not fallowing protocall and they would say well you know i am i am a former atticd i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (5211/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5212/ 10720) 
i think that basically that is itin a nutshow they reached a point in their life where you know the they are cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death ore uh smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh pcrack or whatever and uh eand just living in a hell i mean 

Recording: (5213/ 10720) 
yeah exactly and it is just uh it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (5214/ 10720) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the timeu and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh its i think with age i gets tempered ata little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it  uh you know it does not matter who i vote for they are going to lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was intern i our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to 

Recording: (5215/ 10720)

Recording: (5220/ 10720) 
as just a rule 

Recording: (5221/ 10720) 
right oh and i ae and i am sure it will especially when you already recognize that you know that if if you already know in advance what kind of things you are going to be helping along it is a lot easier than trying to figure out what is going on here you know 

Recording: (5222/ 10720) 
that would not bother me at all 

Recording: (5223/ 10720)

uh well yeah whel librarians traditionally have problems with it is like a form of sensorship you know big brother things librarians have always had problems with that um i i do not know it is it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (5234/ 10720)

see i would be all up in the room too looking see wat reading i i would have be just like my mother was even though i hated it but i would i would n do that 

Recording: (5253/ 10720) 
there there could still be like a think tank of of executives that could be very liberal in their thinking and just you know for social for social not so much social change but you know not not um encouraging sweat shops within their corporation s stuff like that and i would like to i do not know how i would get involved in omething like that but i would like to it would be interesting 

Recording: (5254/ 10720) 
you know and nobody does the sixty hour work weeks like some people apparently are acustomed to around here 

Recording: (5255/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5256/ 10720) 
who is going to witness this no ther is nobodyn here 

Recording: (5257/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5258/ 10720) 
uh  like you have to do something like it is more of a this big procession to do anything you know you have to put on like all these coats where more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like goo go to the park and sit and it is fine but like here you know you get slush everywhere and you got to think of something to do you just can not like drive around and waste time because it is because it is miserable 

Recording: (5259/ 10720) 
rfrom where 

Recording: (5260/ 10720) 
i really do not think we do for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occure just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i do not really see too many sexas problems i definitely do see guys still being 

Recording: (5261/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5262/ 10720) 
very much so 

Recording: (5263/ 10720) 
these spiral notbooks around ande she just riting them and uh since she passed away in nineteen seventy nine i have run across i well i just i finly decided well those notebooks are down there and if i need one for something i will just go ahead and use it and i have run across a couple of her poems that i did not know anything about 

Recording: (5264/ 10720) 
i do not know i she does not bove anymore than she has to i am the one that loves to exercise 

Recording: (5265/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5266/ 10720) 
it is a cartoone i believe it started out 

Recording: (5267/ 10720) 
eah it is my daughter yeah u umhum 

Recording: (5268/ 10720) 
okay dripping down 

Recording: (5269/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5270/ 10720) 
there is nothere is no there is no concept behind it  you are right you are right so to some degree the um area commissions are supposed to work on that and help unify i i used to be on the university area commission in in the campus area and that is one of the things we worked on although we some of the other commissions in collumbus are almost strictly arkitectural they o only talk about 

Recording: (5271/ 10720) 
so i made me squirm a little bit always in my seat en that happened i was kind of like i know who he is talking to  my my mother is two sisters married southern baptist ministers 

Recording: (5272/ 10720) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going nto only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5273/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5274/ 10720) 
so i can sleep in and 

Recording: (5275/ 10720) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with a bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems um an i mean that is really that is really all that i knowice it is obviously a lot more buld up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (5276/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (5277/ 10720) 
and you learn what you have to to get through the tests of course i did thatt when i was here at school 

Recording: (5278/ 10720) 
i did not like his last snowan 

Recording: (5279/ 10720) 
and obviously a lot more dangerous and i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like a college or whatever 

Recording: (5280/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (5281/ 10720) 
there was a little well quite a bit of it was yeah some of the people ind the group did not play sports but it was not all from one sport or another it was football restlers it was usually like the best football players the best restlers 

Recording: (5282/ 10720) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (5283/ 10720) 
than i did yesterday but when we as a society  say oh  ee he struggled yesterday well let us lower this thing a let us lower the bar a little more let us look yeah gosh doar not  hey schoony you did not make that last shot last night a time ou let us get scoony two more minutes  mank let us tell hem  ther ono hot he gets two more minutes to try to get 

Recording: (5284/ 10720) 
yo you know you woud have to hat and stay just happeno stays on to it or something you know uh uh i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the uh with the the guns you know availability of pnd more people having guns that do not know do not should not have themapparently uh you know they should be uh under lock and kee uh yaund ass for the you know the parents somebody is responsible for it you know but see then 

Recording: (5285/ 10720) 
but it was not because it caught fire and that time he was burned on the back 

Recording: (5286/ 10720) 
i mean i am all for anything i could do the sells i could do you know the purchasing i can do i i pretty much can do anything it will be i can be taught to do 

Recording: (5287/ 10720) 
yeh 

Recording: (5288/ 10720) 
no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yuess the baby he is going to be born i i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but  it is all very obvious now uh and she is she is great 

Recording: (5289/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (5290/ 10720) 
against thim in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5291/ 10720) 
yeah they went and won the super bole and they went back and lost the super bol so 

Recording: (5292/ 10720) 
that was always too subjective for me 

Recording: (5293/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (5294/ 10720) 
a i was going to say most of them are 

Recording: (5295/ 10720) 
for the rest of my life and so beit you know i got a consciance and uh and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there but that is yeu know that is basically where i have been you know uh i have lived here in my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball um due to injuries you know  knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro caliber you know u i  played baseball with uh with polonel and 

Recording: (5296/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5297/ 10720) 
leave the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew is baptism and my grandparent is funeral and that is the only time hou will find me in there you know i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because uf the way i follow now and uh and actually seeing things for what they are and it is frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that is okay um the lawsuit uh 

Recording: (5298/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5299/ 10720) 
in his own mind regardless it is part of that bad spirit that people have created not the devel not saton toe native people he does not exist and to me he does not exist he is pisshit but he is real 

Recording: (5300/ 10720) 
um either rol playing games 

Recording: (5301/ 10720) 
yea you know i like you know  hay that the th the i typical american tourist 

Recording: (5302/ 10720) 
she did but we were out 

Recording: (5303/ 10720) 
and um i do not know i think having just having the word onors gives it some kids enough prestige that they do not totally frgout about not going  iv leag 

Recording: (5304/ 10720) 
h 

Recording: (5305/ 10720) 
oul make any difference or not 

Recording: (5306/ 10720) 
not too far from here 

Recording: (5307/ 10720) 
really i have not noticed that yet hm 

Recording: (5308/ 10720) 
because it was also a nice like a hundred or such a pretty round number 

Recording: (5309/ 10720) 
probably it is heare rihte i i asked him what language did he have to learn to g 

Recording: (5310/ 10720) 
tthen when i found out there ware so many openings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech theropy as a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper where they do not process things correctly auditorially so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (5311/ 10720) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all forhm together as a group and almost be uh parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it acts ass as the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even na where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (5312/ 10720) 
ou know and they work hard you know to make it easier on the students you know they totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (5313/ 10720) 
w all of that plus by the time you get to first gad yu resupposed to have n o the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them ind order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred you are supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (5314/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5315/ 10720) 
well i would say in springfilled ya 

Recording: (5316/ 10720) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bonds and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody got mad at somebody you know you yhou might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (5317/ 10720) 
so family um familiarity and um just a community i think crime i think is going up and up um traffic and sorandas with the one but i mean you need to go through that right now because collumbus is expending so much that we need the 

Recording: (5318/ 10720) 
yeah  wo and um um you know at the time i was like i am not going to get anything ot of this and it was misery and  whatnot but i have met people that have been in much worse situations and at least i can kind of relate to them 

Recording: (5319/ 10720) 
uh you know just always just active and he is always been very active in sports but when i put thim on the rittlin he was um laying on the couch you know just zombied out 

Recording: (5320/ 10720) 
s like talking like i am at work you know so it is like like i do not know  pick up the phone like 

Recording: (5321/ 10720) 
to melt and soften the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire that you have ever touched or been around and that fire is sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down 

Recording: (5322/ 10720)

Recording: (5329/ 10720) 
yeahso uh you know i felt like you know the plaeris mal would benefit columbus and uh all all the way around you know uh as far as uh you know what was going on with that jacubs coming here and running all that advertising about north lamont 

Recording: (5330/ 10720)

Recording: (5338/ 10720) 
oo and i hate hering myself on tap too 

Recording: (5339/ 10720) 
i you know from my perspective which is sceed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be afferican american um if i were affrican american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touoch with it with 

Recording: (5340/ 10720) 
yeah it is u that it is on all in tangy down here north of there 

Recording: (5341/ 10720) 
yeah like when i do the sik screening and this it is kind of random but just anything 

Recording: (5342/ 10720) 
is extrordinarily similar um so what she says might not might be diometrical applosed to what i say 

Recording: (5343/ 10720) 
there generally tends to be at least one or two republicans i vote for each eaeach election o sometimes i voted straight democrat because i just you know i even voted for dorthy teeter the first time she ran for county commissioner uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and i i liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i i did not vote for her after that but the first time she ran for  county commissioner i did it one because she was a woman and i liked you know i it was not possible i would like to vote for women

Recording: (5346/ 10720) 
yeah i mean i tried and tried i just see it that he is not changing i and i you know you keep hoping hehes you just keep hoping but it is all upon him and obviously he does not love me enough to really want to change and settle down he still wants to do those things he is doing and i just need to move on 

Recording: (5347/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5348/ 10720) 
somebody is watching and

Recording: (5350/ 10720) 
o woman i can not say i really ever have a relation with her whatever unfortunately although i do not like it yeah i i do not know i just i am a pretty indecisive person i i like making decisions and she is kind of the same way so when it comes to what we are going to do or whatever it takes us hours to decide what we are going to do at i mean it just gets i nowhere 

Recording: (5351/ 10720) 
is that the way jeesus crist would have brought that here well some people have their opinion i said no no i said you you wear that coller you do something about that if you do not then i realize what a spineless person you are but you will never find me in your church again so i have done what i have done but and there is a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spirituality and they will become self proclaimed spiritual leaders uh 

Recording: (5352/ 10720)

right right 

Recording: (5379/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (5380/ 10720) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded 

Recording: (5381/ 10720) 
do you want this doner to be this this and that ow some people will some people some people say that i feel sorry for those people and i pray for those people because prayer is the most powerful thing you can have that is going to get you through nothing else i do not care what ci challenge you have in front of you you put in his hands and you have enough faith to practice that it will come through it may not come throughh the way you think it is you want it to but some where onn the line you are gong to say 

Recording: (5382/ 10720)

ou know a 

Recording: (5388/ 10720) 
ay 

Recording: (5389/ 10720) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually 

Recording: (5390/ 10720) 
u 

Recording: (5391/ 10720) 
so therefore they can they are not public or they can put whatever they want

Recording: (5397/ 10720) 
i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers and i said yeas you can make money  rith computers and i said what could i make money with computers 

Recording: (5398/ 10720)

Recording: (5400/ 10720) 
three years i have them usually have him six seventh and eighth for those language art subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get fased out like right now i am fasing a t and eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still a terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his assignmente and as long as you clearly explaine to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspells something 

Recording: (5401/ 10720) 
yeah much too fast for me you know my 

Recording: (5402/ 10720) 
yeah that is what it is it is a marketing thing 

Recording: (5403/ 10720) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (5404/ 10720) 
there were things out but there is nothing like what they have today you know the small little handguns and things like that that are real easy carriable and conceelable i mean like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switch blades things like that y i mean i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (5405/ 10720) 
so he uh you know he was strictly a union man you kno so he kept his he believed in the unions you know so the railrad was union you know 

Recording: (5406/ 10720) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (5407/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5408/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5409/ 10720) 
but you can also you an also grow with respect you can work with the community and still gain a respect from community and you dont have allegeence but you know now adays we do not have an loyalty at all that is out the windo uh and that is wha i fear the most you are saying there and at yeah big deal you are going uter for what you want well maybe somepeople want little cost they donol want service okay boom disposable that is ha problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to commuteyou 

Recording: (5410/ 10720) 
yonow that is a real major question istit uhh no i do not think it is too bad i mean um well uh well we could go into the issue of uh the clumbus bord of education what is his name he is always 

Recording: (5411/ 10720) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5412/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5413/ 10720) 
most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore so theydo not have to catch them they do not have to process them etcetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really 

Recording: (5414/ 10720) 
no 

Recording: (5415/ 10720) 
i think when you have two or more pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (5416/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (5417/ 10720) 
like it is like we are taking catalog words over the phone it is o i really a big deal like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us which was where college church and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they te they yell it likenife like for hugging or whatever like they tolld us that one day that we could not hug and they are like now that is like you can not hug in here or something like that they are like it it takes away from the professional attitude like i do not even know what to say to people like that like this is like such a different 

Recording: (5418/ 10720) 
but it is uh it is necessary for the way i follow if it is not especially for men women have a purifacation every month 

Recording: (5419/ 10720) 
i am a senior 

Recording: (5420/ 10720)

Recording: (5463/ 10720) 
i mean there is always been the nerds and um i do not know when i was grown up in the seventies there really was not punk or o anything like that and i think um unfortunately i mean there is lways going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i watch all these shows dat line and twety twenty and all thise informant ofe shows 

Recording: (5464/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (5465/ 10720) 
yeah that is 

Recording: (5466/ 10720) 
i do not know i had not thought about that um a i n no i do not i do not get the impression the values has anything to do with what they are doing in this school 

Recording: (5467/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (5468/ 10720) 
e not going t mak as much money the people are going to say ge i am not going to them u goin goin gong w play saylse again it getts back to weaknesses in our standard sin our society we we di not care less about anybody else we do not hey if i have problems the government is going to help me out that is a mind set that is been entrenched for forty some years it is a mindset that av you talke to the older generations a i are dying off now that said we would never had in our lifetime it is a ronation of our country and have you were old enough to remember cruschef i believe chruschef is 

Recording: (5469/ 10720) 
umhum i did 

Recording: (5470/ 10720) 
the beginning of the end  yep um grop in upere arlingtonm not sorry yeah really those five miles make such a difference though like because i yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (5471/ 10720) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in e sense that they were there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them and like it was getting and they had like we are on the front page of the accrammucan journal because they had a lock down where no one was alloued to leave their classroom and then they brought the the dogs through and they found i 

Recording: (5472/ 10720) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help 

Recording: (5473/ 10720) 
yeah i mean but i mean we are not in a depression and and the you know the employment rate is fine and health cares we have got some improvements there and like i said that hat i di o en t  be no you knowu but i just i mean so i mid not say he is done a a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we have wasted where we could have spent that money on something else you know whand you end up doing that 

Recording: (5474/ 10720) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5475/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 10720) 
laughed about it and i let her um i let her skip it ti because i decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5477/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (5478/ 10720) 
um he was in so much trouble and he was that was the main reason why i did not stay with him its he was just draining on me and pulling me down so  he was never really there he was in and out of jail all the time and i would go through the whole uh  buro thriald support that whole thing and that was a total mess you know i wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff well it turned out he could just move 

Recording: (5479/ 10720) 
yeah yeah that is the worst part there a lot they could really double they took our neighbor is in the sixth grade and they took a whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade 

Recording: (5480/ 10720) 
a couple three times too but on the phone and everything and then a sitter and said well you go ahead and you know you can call me every name in a book to whateer heck you want to but i am still your father so 

Recording: (5481/ 10720) 
he was adjusting on us and we could not we did not catch on to where it was right away but by the time we started looking for our holes which were not deep enough we realized that he was in a clump of of cactas 

Recording: (5482/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (5483/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5484/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5485/ 10720) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sexs they are and they treat them well uh so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting them they obviously w know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (5486/ 10720) 
eighty eight so we j we just had our eleventh wedding aniversary yeah 

Recording: (5487/ 10720) 
wout being with them 

Recording: (5488/ 10720) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a half way decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to disuse like you said it wallk the necessities 

Recording: (5489/ 10720) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but  they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (5490/ 10720) 
and columbine  you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts we are all over the place but that is another kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not 

Recording: (5491/ 10720) 
today is society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would talking talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing uh our uh early life uh we did not even know what a nicclar a dime was uh thois e that was unimportant and we also were talking about how uh how we uh went i uuh he was talling me a little bit about and i said let me stop you pall i said pall what 

Recording: (5492/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5493/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (5494/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (5495/ 10720) 
and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three  four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (5496/ 10720) 
mhum right 

Recording: (5497/ 10720) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is the driving force of our of our of our government and and even like because yo without without a revenue based from the taxes of corporations th you could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they  become fairly powerful but i do not think that is necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because 

Recording: (5498/ 10720) 
uhmuh 

Recording: (5499/ 10720)

it was about a bunch of tenage ravers 

Recording: (5548/ 10720) 
uh yeah well um i think the teachers are every bit as good as i is dedicated but i think thee seems to be uh the whole administration  up through the board and just it is not as focused i do no i do not know how to disgrae like the teachers are sort of it seems like they almost have the feeling they are on their own where 

Recording: (5549/ 10720) 
and i have heard the thing you know you are not my real fither and all that we went through all that 

Recording: (5550/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5551/ 10720) 
now we used to do uh fifty cents you know a game you know just to win back tho qorters and plop them in you know not too much gambling on that part you know 

Recording: (5552/ 10720) 
um uh the the the public transit system i mean i know they are doing the best they can but i do not see how we are ever going to get out of this without light rail and i am really bumped 

Recording: (5553/ 10720) 
ou are right on the top 

Recording: (5554/ 10720) 
um in a fight and they just said they we want to be um looked at as just other kids you know in high school but yet when they wear make up and they spike their hair and they have all these peercings you know it is like they o they do not want to be like everybody else 

Recording: (5555/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (5556/ 10720) 
i do not i do not know if that is what pirculates te it is very different in the public schools and the catholic scoos and the public school you have all the problems of society in n the school you have the drugs you have the absent parents you have the delinquency well in the catholic school they just you do not have that for one thing a you know it is oriented around a church eve though we are not catholic is still oriented that so there is a lot of values that purmiates everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that i somebody is going to get kicked off it is the wrong 

Recording: (5557/ 10720) 
or to stand on our own on anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independent weit was sit stubbern but it is like even go to macdonald is or something and he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and tell him 

Recording: (5558/ 10720) 
yeah i live in uh seawerd holle oh yeak uh i think theye are a hundred and seventy of us here or just from my class alone 

Recording: (5559/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (5560/ 10720) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go there 

Recording: (5561/ 10720) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have fined like one or two guns so and that to me t was but my high school i is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (5562/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (5563/ 10720) 
do not know if i if it really if you really if feel like the the that whole health care thing whichis no thing ever happened with really you know and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they do not they do not ever really put anything into action an it is kind of skate along you know and i do not know if there is anything substantial i could say that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it um economy is fine i mean so  it is not that he is really he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing you know 

Recording: (5564/ 10720) 
right right 

Recording: (5565/ 10720)

Recording: (5567/ 10720) 
umu 

Recording: (5568/ 10720) 
yeah i thought it was going to be  like not so structured but it really is and like especially i mean i i know it is like all first year classes are basically the same and it is just kind of like how i do not know i thought it would be different like more of uh like more of an adult type thing when really it is just they treat you exact same way like u ot knoh yeah  i think that is true and like i lived in 

Recording: (5569/ 10720) 
no right person you are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (5570/ 10720) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be u normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (5571/ 10720) 
there is a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (5572/ 10720) 
to people who do not get along and we look at the problems it was centered on that uh i i am getting off tope wa wanted to go back to to voyager what you were saying with the the the uh generals i i liked at first having uh captin jainewait meaning a female in the leadership standpoint but i i still think that uh the the women on the show particularlyu seven of nine uh are are used as sex objects 

Recording: (5573/ 10720)

sixteen years old um 

Recording: (5577/ 10720) 
just one school so that is how many of thes there were

yeah 

Recording: (5580/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5581/ 10720) 
yeah yeah i do not know if you remember you might not be quite old enough but you may know this song chene oconer nothing compares to you   when 

Recording: (5582/ 10720)

Recording: (5583/ 10720) 
in the future

yeah not me it is too expensive 

Recording: (5962/ 10720)

oh we have fun 

Recording: (5971/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5972/ 10720) 
yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (5973/ 10720) 
you know so i think maybe not universal health care but for children i think it would be helpful 

Recording: (5974/ 10720) 
e because we wantod be because it is a privileage now because um i got i go to another play you know my daughter just did a play down town with cllumbais junior theater and i ushured at eighteen performances because i could see it free i d i did not want to pay ten bucks every time to see it but if i usured i could be in the audience every time you know and for my parents to have no interest in seeing seeing play baseball or swims for ohio wesly and you know orn ta play they they would not they do not even want to be 

Recording: (5975/ 10720)

so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (5977/ 10720) 
yes 

Recording: (5978/ 10720) 
so i do not know whether they did any damage or not but 

Recording: (5979/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (5980/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (5981/ 10720) 
well quarterbakis got a injury to his hand i mean he still does good he just he needs to focus in on who he is throwing at instead of throwing it fifty miles down the road  he is done that coupleof times yesterday and uh watching out who he is thrown to you know might help to 

Recording: (5982/ 10720) 
you know so it is you know if you if you have a problem if you want to talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (5983/ 10720) 
but most of the time it is not it is not bad um so there is there is that it is a opportunity for the musicians in the college to play in an orchestra and yeah what else do they get out of it i do not know prestige i suppose  yeah 

Recording: (5984/ 10720) 
and as a result like the are kids my age and stuff like that that i have talked to i mean they have no idea what is going on 

Recording: (5985/ 10720)

Recording: (5990/ 10720) 
d nobody is worth that you know so that is what i am saying it is so retarded uh wte i do not mean to use that word in a bad way but it is ridiculous andit but  that maybe that is a better word uh that that people have to uh uh have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can not afford the legal help so i think that is wrong in this country the lang of the free ind the home and the brave yeah right 

Recording: (5991/ 10720)

ell  it is not just in the schools it is ina society uh in violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things and i it is a i just can not i it is hard to imagine that that there is an easy fixer if there is a fixed i  it is kind of frustrating because you you can not point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed  gan it is pervasive uh it is like the onnow if you heard about this in the news a woman two women were having an argument one

Recording: (6080/ 10720) 
it is like each neighborhood is got a little different personality 

Recording: (6081/ 10720) 
that is what you better hoe 

Recording: (6082/ 10720) 
we want to clean or anything they would probably say you know they might think it was kind of weird but they would let you you know but they would be like you want to do this and we do not have any money to pay you oh but we do not you know we do not want money that is the whole point weare 

Recording: (6083/ 10720) 
my wife was a uh very conscientious hard working woman she established a secretarial business there at or a homeh for several years and uh anything that went out of there was right i mean  and uh she did eh quite a lot of typing for students over here  graduaand students 

Recording: (6084/ 10720) 
oh that was the monica loinsky 

Recording: (6085/ 10720) 
yeah yeah she is been known to do that too yep 

Recording: (6086/ 10720) 
no that is 

Recording: (6087/ 10720) 
i think they were doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easier rot 

Recording: (6088/ 10720) 
it is an example in in school they changed the way they were doing theiruh mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geomatry and aljibra you would think nd i used to e straght aes in algibra when i got to geomta thoug why  my taking this so that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are teaching it entirelly dfferent now and i think linda explained to how they weredoing it with matheu and said she could not even help him und so you know it s in the same way with politics it people 

Recording: (6089/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (6090/ 10720) 
ancestors from or whatever and then you would tell them and then you know on the same term they would just sort of like snigger ando be like oh you are not whatever of this european thing you are you know sort of 

Recording: (6091/ 10720) 
and uh where my mom was ah a young high school student  just graduating from high school and so they got together there and moved to california 

Recording: (6092/ 10720) 
he is got this thing like uh thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all and then 

Recording: (6093/ 10720) 
oh you get your choice klthat is 

Recording: (6094/ 10720) 
yeah that could really buiht you in the back though when in all that money i would be well i would be quite content with one million dollars but ten million dollars is kind of like a overkill i mean do you think anybody in this town has ten million dollars well maybe a couple f people yeahitis 

Recording: (6095/ 10720) 
yeah when i first went to oberland i was a performance major in th french horn and looking back on it i wish i whould maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more do mention in terms of my my teaching possibilities and um although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh 

Recording: (6096/ 10720) 
so am kind of doing that and then i figure i am probably goin to waike tables at night  and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (6097/ 10720) 
because that is like me i watch the three studets and you do not see me putting no crobar up in eovry body is nose

yeah like ah keeboard and like this phone and you put on a headset and stuff and u   okay i mean people call in and um 

Recording: (6100/ 10720)

actually in order to get in my room you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid ind other the way your qualify in the state of ohio is you have a thirty point discrepency between your actual icue ind your daily performance in other words let us say you have a hundred icue but in all of your classes you are performing like a seventy ique person would so if there is a thirty point discrepancy in there  and people see that you are bright and but yet you are just not

all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a formufil out and how much you have if you have taken any depretiation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is the percentage that goes on to your schedule etheat goes in the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (6421/ 10720) 
umhum umhum yeah but that those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although our conductor tries hard to make it interesting for orchestra members by bringing in some music that is that is interesting challenging or whatever for orchestra he is uh we are lucky to have him he is he is a associate conductor for the uh collumbus symphony umhum 

Recording: (6422/ 10720) 
why can not they fake hours to make it easier for us to understand but you know but no usually there is no problem the only problem usually have is  like somebody like yourself who has never flowne and is taking lessons and you have you  you have about ten or fifteen hours and we tell you to do something and you like um well i think i know what they mean so i will just keep flying and tat it is the worst thing you can do the best thing to do is say okay i heard what you said but i am brand new at this and i have got no idea what you mean can you try it again and they will go okay 

Recording: (6423/ 10720) 
i uh i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but uuh but t isni i i do not like it as well as clumbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university ayeah 

Recording: (6424/ 10720) 
yeah we are getting impatient and we are getting um it is it is sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now there will be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are we are really not doing justice to the carriculum and i say to my friends i say teach these kids well because they are going to be 

Recording: (6425/ 10720) 
but historically you know women were not you know it was a man is field and and you know even women who were doing it and doing it well did not get the attention did not get 

Recording: (6426/ 10720) 
no over on uh bula you know where that over by north bradway were said 

Recording: (6427/ 10720) 
yeah but um just to see the church might be fun um we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worchip center building and because we were really too too big for the sanctuary that we had 

Recording: (6428/ 10720) 
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and 

Recording: (6429/ 10720) 
really 

Recording: (6430/ 10720) 
mature very driven the only problem she had is she did not have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of her self but she chooses to be still at home and be a part of our life and um my son he is both of use kids have four points i mean they ale really work hard in school because they know it is important and my son was uh he was the only only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i am really 

Recording: (6431/ 10720) 
oh really i as like wow milk and twiszlers 

Recording: (6432/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (6433/ 10720)

Recording: (6436/ 10720) 
themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that do not like voyagers so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it as something that would be even griddierh they had the potential for for excellent inter character conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season um and that really bothered me and hen if ultimately this stor i they are trapped 

Recording: (6437/ 10720) 
i knowtice d my husband sometimes i mean we have taken joy out to the semitary a few times to go to the graveside of his mother and he says you know very often boy she would really have like to have been here and done things with him 

Recording: (6438/ 10720)

hat is a rule coming down handnd down 

Recording: (6440/ 10720) 
umm 

Recording: (6441/ 10720) 
oh yeah it is so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and look in your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course uh so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside two seventis still so 

Recording: (6442/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (6443/ 10720) 
but 

Recording: (6444/ 10720)

Recording: (6448/ 10720) 
ou know the axcess is just there is almost nothing bared and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of you know in conversation talking about oh yeah i you know getting i gotten for security and all this stuff it is like you know what your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you

Recording: (6456/ 10720) 
probably i mean i just even notice like road rates just in general like with myself when i was working full time even with my child at home just the frustration of getting home i was so stressed with work and now being part time 

Recording: (6457/ 10720) 
ed i got good neighbors 

Recording: (6458/ 10720) 
hey can be paying me to go to finish high school and then they can also they will also pay me to finish college and and they will help me out you know i have not seen anyone 

Recording: (6459/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (6460/ 10720) 
very well and you know her vocabularies limited and she did not know how to spell or know any bigger words so i tryed to sit her down and you know give her a little refreshher and you know it is coming from a new jersey public school and do ing to study then you know couple of these different places you never even hear of like 

Recording: (6461/ 10720) 
i would not like it to be that way but uh basically when i was in to service tha the women uh had their own area of the service that they were allowed to be basically nurses and stuff you know 

Recording: (6462/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6463/ 10720) 
first of all it took i had a statute of limitations was two years uhi had an attorney and a law firm representid thim but they were dragging their feet i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill you know and they they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet even though i knew the guy so i just said wo look i am dissatisfied i am going to go find another attorney so give me my file see and i 

Recording: (6464/ 10720) 
that and i heard i kind of liked the change they are talking about they are talking about putting underground power lines and taking the pols out 

Recording: (6465/ 10720) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (6466/ 10720) 
we wun we were victorious we did not won  you know 

Recording: (6467/ 10720) 
i you know i cld i just could not see doing that and it was i had enough to worry about and think about what i was tryng to teach class keep everything else straight and also marked down if people are participating uh that was tough i i ended up not doing it 

Recording: (6468/ 10720) 
and you probably know that theyare well there are four and i think they are four and five right now a

Recording: (6470/ 10720) 
ll i work in the countig department i am a counting asistant 

Recording: (6471/ 10720) 
uh i do believe that in someof cases uh the the parents or the uh responsible adult should be uh found guilty of that 

Recording: (6472/ 10720) 
right they and that is it they have not had a challenge you need to have a challenge t is put to you every day every dayecause they have more meaning fol n is an like so that when you put your head down onight you re say you w i am thankful for what i did  gosh durnit i am still coming to you i need more help tomorrow because  without something intangible there is going to be a motivation factor something is going to give you a drill and they get up tomorrow morning and say hey i am going a do a better job today 

Recording: (6473/ 10720) 
and they need to uh they need to have pychological help period 

Recording: (6474/ 10720) 
or the the drugs was not the problem and we have dealt with several counselers and that is all they wanted to deal with or problem has always been it is a simptom uh took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally charly is he is very intuitive and even as a toddeler he could do this he he seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him 

Recording: (6475/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (6476/ 10720) 
byebye 

Recording: (6477/ 10720)

Recording: (6592/ 10720) 
so i mean it is something i am i am comfortable with 

Recording: (6593/ 10720) 
see people now off suden tere is a rash of fires you read that in the news and people keep doing it i think society as a whole has gotten a lot more violent which made the kids more violent

uh well we put all kinds of information out on their own web sighte which there is so much it is very hard to find what you want you know it is that is a constant problem with information is the more you put out there the hard it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it uh itis it is a problem for us and for libraries because there is just a barage of what they are getting and it is not just from us it is fothe literature um there is 

Recording: (6680/ 10720) 
i was in the cub scouts 

Recording: (6681/ 10720)

Recording: (6687/ 10720) 
yeah like they all get the option but i i understand very few exercise it so you know if they were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are not using and then give them the two dollars an hour you knowb but then that could then you could say that oesu is helping to keep people down and so you have to still it is it is an od balance there it is and likeits something like that does not seem too skilled to me so i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but 

Recording: (6688/ 10720) 
yes 

Recording: (6689/ 10720)

Recording: (6769/ 10720) 
i think so he is he is not being forced to go in any direction that he is not ready for yeah i was going to college and and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so he was very independent but i am not sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put

Recording: (6778/ 10720) 
i mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tec tape recorder not a big real real thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh ligearary if congress has it i will just drive out

n we are we are finished 

Recording: (6783/ 10720)

Recording: (6942/ 10720) 
oh they do ind ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get theyiar act togethe r because they are going to have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know i am going to play in a rock band oh you know they all think they are gong o be wrock stars and drummers and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life

Recording: (6979/ 10720) 
yeah and and the problem is the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the yes are the maor to the sal at is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (6980/ 10720) 
well they always did because the first time i had one i was thirty six years old 

Recording: (6981/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (6982/ 10720)

Recording: (6983/ 10720) 
oh yeah um we just do not really talk about that very oftenan and i am just 

Recording: (6984/ 10720) 
nobody really admits it but oh i grabd the paper because i wantd to see what the agreement was and it is pretty much the same thing and they are voting positively for it this time 

Recording: (6985/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (6986/ 10720) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not cheat on them 

Recording: (6987/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (6988/ 10720) 
and outside of english french is a horribly popular language for different countries to have as a second language so i think it would be extrordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french 

Recording: (6989/ 10720) 
that is true 

Recording: (6990/ 10720) 
ot always have the gun well obviously that is not true you know uh my personal belief is that weave the right to bear arms uh if you are of ilegal age and everything i am not really sure that the background checks really do that grade of a job 

Recording: (6991/ 10720) 
so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i would call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go ho that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (6992/ 10720)

Recording: (7001/ 10720)

Recording: (7020/ 10720)

Recording: (7030/ 10720)

ou like the university level 

Recording: (7041/ 10720) 
you look forward to coming home you know and the pets waiting on you 

Recording: (7042/ 10720) 
yeah and because ih back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying intention a lot you know like i read the colmus dispach every day and i read us news and world report from my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (7043/ 10720) 
hum 

Recording: (7044/ 10720) 
you know what i mean you can not do this you can not do that 

Recording: (7045/ 10720) 
d i always understood each other  always stop witing so my father and i i am going tostart getting phone calls here in a little bit i will just postpone so my father and i always for the third time understood each other much better than my mother and i did um we were able to communicate in uh very similar fasions we did not always agree and in fact i probably more diametrically opposed to him than anybody else i ever got to play with um but at least e understood what was going on from one moment to the next and so 

Recording: (7046/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7047/ 10720) 
and i do not know whether my i do not think my secondtsister ever went to school out there but uh things were so tough that and mom had taught school at iowa where she grew up and uh got our teacher sortipicot so i guess she and dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with us kids through the 

Recording: (7048/ 10720) 
so um there is from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person had quite an experience with it 

Recording: (7049/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7050/ 10720) 
there is too much information and too much change uh librarians eu this is against probably what the image of librarians are they are very very eager to embrace change uh internet came out and you know whenit when it got out of the areaf it was being used by universities or whatever for research that is what it was at first librarians were right there and they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they can do with it uh when pc is yeah we 

Recording: (7051/ 10720) 
that is where my father is from 

Recording: (7052/ 10720) 
but the vast majority are engineers i like math and science so i figured well engineering i donot know any other options i must be engineering so i came to college and i got into the honneris engineering freshman freshmann onnoris engineering program called the gatway program engineering is the hardest field to study aside probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really 

Recording: (7053/ 10720) 
no no it does not 

Recording: (7054/ 10720) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation you know mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his and he said his dad told him about condoms you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus 

Recording: (7055/ 10720) 
and when they get home they do not wan to do anything so they pay to have the yeard done they do this at  and it is like they have then they always go we have no money and it is like because you pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know it is ciut is like you making your suup you know when if and when you have children when they get my age they are going o go i can  remember walking around the house and going mom is making bean suup or mom is making vegetable souup oer mom baked a cake and it is likeh as opposed to openit up oh here is a mir cake you know 

Recording: (7056/ 10720)

Recording: (7057/ 10720) 
well iissee growing up we did not we it was not really called sexed um they talked about the female reproductive system nothing about men which is kind of funny you know it was always the women in that chart you know 

Recording: (7058/ 10720) 
i heard something the other day that really really upset me i was at um this convention downtown at the convention center and uh one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops as a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear 

Recording: (7059/ 10720) 
yeah i just a player you know i mean they lost uh four or five different uh top noch player so i went to the pros and most of them are starting or you know so uh little cooperis thing is we do not rebuild load you know well sometimes it takes a couple of years to reloaad you know but i have never been a abit faint ofcopereer so they just says some stupid things 

Recording: (7060/ 10720) 
it makes me angry that people like thatwoud even get money 

Recording: (7061/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7062/ 10720) 
oh definitely 

Recording: (7063/ 10720) 
so i was shut out of the job market then tnoow i that did not bother me i thought well it wil fine i went that is when i got the job of channel four but uh it is like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad 

Recording: (7064/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (7065/ 10720) 
the risks and what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone the high part of it 

Recording: (7066/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7067/ 10720) 
maybe 

Recording: (7068/ 10720) 
the same every day and not just like a lecture and when then we do home work and turn it in like you know it is like we do like like an history class we do like roal roal plain things and like 

Recording: (7069/ 10720) 
right i can ou think oh i want to go back and take some classes you know i keep think ow i go bac  to school but i can not even narrow down what i would want to take there is so much stuff ore so many areas that are interesting to me 

Recording: (7070/ 10720) 
bby the minerly hokiy team tho columbus chill whanever they um they do not have it now but uh because the blue jackets came iw but but i think it would be goo if it goes but i am just not sure that collumbush is going to support somethinglike uha that is basically a high state you know and they do not avne sport the uh hocky team we got frite a high state you know and yet they are good 

Recording: (7071/ 10720) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have ta paid offi about five years sod then we are talking about moving to some place a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (7072/ 10720) 
um and it it is kind of weird because you when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7073/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7074/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7075/ 10720) 
i i do not like dubia i i do not i do not i mean i my uh i guess my uh mom was a democrat my dad was a republican 

Recording: (7076/ 10720) 
yeah my wife and i like to do that 

Recording: (7077/ 10720) 
exactly h 

Recording: (7078/ 10720) 
prirs i know she was playing on going to uh saint louis university which i wanted to go to missouri university of missoury but 

Recording: (7079/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (7080/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7081/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (7082/ 10720) 
do it the hardway or the easy way well i think everybody should have to do it the hired way i mean frankly um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it 

Recording: (7083/ 10720) 
yeah i think they do 

Recording: (7084/ 10720) 
o not that i have seen you know 

Recording: (7085/ 10720) 
if they hold you know enough of my views i am not going to vote for a woman just because they are a woman and i am not going to vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have you know at least and and i do not need a hundred percent uh agreement with my views but iwoul like thoy be it in the ninety to ninety five percent range um but yeah uh i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have i have modirated from when i was uh in college to today 

Recording: (7086/ 10720) 
nd then when i went out there she had uh security removed me off the premises that following monday because i was supposed to go out and signe something for a lease did not really happen that way i went and signed it and i came back to school monday thinking yeah well another day another dollar or whatever get there and they go ahead and out the door wi 

Recording: (7087/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (7088/ 10720) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i am do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the thi place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learningte material i mean sort of i mean i mean  it is working well enough i guess 

Recording: (7089/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7090/ 10720) 
when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tapp into that um in addition to that and as an undercurrent it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abbortion is a a very devicive issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also devides them you know definitively almost like in vietnam i almost 

Recording: (7091/ 10720) 
i i knew that kendergarden because it is it is not required in the state of ohio anyway they really are not required to be in school or and rolled in anything until they are sixt by september when i found that out it was like oh okay cole you know can keep him home i mean he is he could probably go into the second grade i mean he is very brighte he can read and rite and ad and he he you know he is so it is a challenge for me 

Recording: (7092/ 10720) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and pileris and umm um i do not know it is northland is such uh a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um a hurting or you know a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both i mean there is lazerus everywhere there ire seers everywhere or not why not have iat both places i mean i would not particularly go up to pilers 

Recording: (7093/ 10720) 
tocd and yeah yeah 

Recording: (7094/ 10720) 
plus the mental health aspect of it you know you think 

Recording: (7095/ 10720) 
umhum umhum but i do not know if that is i think the the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce had that been an option um i i think it s just i think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after theh divorce is final i mean not do you see what does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (7096/ 10720) 
great 

Recording: (7097/ 10720) 
it is so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is going ta happen to me eventually

Recording: (7263/ 10720) 
i moved to leuwiville kentucky 

Recording: (7264/ 10720) 
it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings so i mean there is a i mean yeah the animal theropy is a very good thing my dog has been very um supportive and very you know like you say the unconditional love part you know i mean how you could you could you could leave for a week and come back and they are they are like okay  i am glad you are back you know

Recording: (7274/ 10720) 
i mean i think the reason that our generation is  cinical r the reason i am cinical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the the the hipocracy i mean i guess in justice id also applis ind terms of things like the cold war and stuff it that is why i am cinical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kind of pre like this is my position

Recording: (7324/ 10720) 
like this push to the right that is sort of going o a hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four a ninety five but uh i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (7325/ 10720) 
it is just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (7326/ 10720) 
yeah i have heard that tooit just differe it is different and you know i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were at this age or is this worse you know you know and i then you can talk to some other people that  oh you have not seen anything yet waiht til they just do not even want to be in sight wath you and do not wait til they you know i am not going on vacation with you i

the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you would probably have a lot of impathy for them 

Recording: (7335/ 10720) 
government does not seem to work too swiftly 

Recording: (7336/ 10720) 
like there would be kids saying yes mam yes mam yes mam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or cutting school and stuff 

Recording: (7337/ 10720) 
te leaking you know uh ceilings all of the pealing floors all the the bad chock boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we are not going to support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite chack we went in and wesaid you knoww eighteen months later when the board put another um ou uh levey on the the ballot we said these are great school we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement 

Recording: (7338/ 10720) 
and she did this and she did this and this and they are going to go oh you know it is like you know what what what do you want at the very end you know so 

Recording: (7339/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (7340/ 10720) 
i was going to say ie i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to they still do not want ta go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is allamoney and all that kind of thing and and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know

Recording: (7386/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7387/ 10720) 
as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it is yeah i mean when i when you come down to these things there is uh people with mental illness ind with the disability are trying to pawn off the responsibility on to everybody but themselves you know well the medical doctors if they would have seen this guy and given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody you know shil would have coud i man u if the guy stopped taking his

Recording: (7391/ 10720) 
his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that is not necessarily his opinion i s what i am trying to make a point there  but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from uh of various people within his community or whether whether you are talking about a township or county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then 

Recording: (7392/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (7393/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7394/ 10720)

familiar with sarcoviesoh 

Recording: (7397/ 10720) 
no not really i mean i would have prefered it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but no i am i am very happy and content with her decisionyeah very much so an as a matter of fact ironically juli thealso she and her husband both baptists they have both their children and a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool an 

Recording: (7398/ 10720) 
ou have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs a show well then that is when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture sohum 

Recording: (7399/ 10720) 
years ago because it was something well it was right there worthit was with a lot of people population and everything and then like i say if you you know if yo get basically the people moving out to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff you know not that they are moving away from it they are still getting into it but the it is just your perspective uuh uh then you have to if you build it they will come they say you know so umhum umhu an 

Recording: (7400/ 10720) 
even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university there re iyou do not hear any like like universal negative things about this about the university ever

Recording: (7407/ 10720) 
um currently unemployed umhum 

Recording: (7408/ 10720) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run  it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robaby in a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or 

Recording: (7409/ 10720) 
uh well iil take for one thing when i was overcees if we wanted to do sometin we wouldwait until the sirgan went in the shead and wewould just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out

Recording: (7412/ 10720) 
yeah can not really take her with you  yeah you can not get her inyou can not get her in you have to be eighteen to get into dance clubs now but um that is uh those are ther two really really really tough ones that a lot of people will h will will 

Recording: (7413/ 10720) 
oh grge ohdomia i do not know i have not really formed an opinion i can not 

Recording: (7414/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7415/ 10720) 
but obviously you would try to steer them more in which ever direction they are most suited for you know as f far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you think that you can you know there is something you know hopefully that i do not know 

Recording: (7416/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7417/ 10720) 
a couple of restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and we are more of ah 

Recording: (7418/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (7419/ 10720) 
that way but at least we could move around a little bit but uh 

Recording: (7420/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (7421/ 10720) 
umhum we had a few ideas um i am thinking it might be an obgin 

Recording: (7422/ 10720) 
main campus the same 

Recording: (7423/ 10720) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7424/ 10720) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (7425/ 10720) 
but of course whenever they needed to wride or anything like that they would comme to me 

Recording: (7426/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7427/ 10720) 
develop things as they accommadate to our own selfish beings not to the saccrifice of what we should be doing and we are all moretoit and we are all going nd be in that and we are i am going to saying no one makes those errors makes ereors it is always there the problem is just try to stay focused on that not to jump ship you know they ar say in this country  oh you d not like t leave it 

Recording: (7428/ 10720) 
that they do not weare like the lad hawaan shirts and and you know n the shorts and the camera is that that they do they

Recording: (7476/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (7477/ 10720) 
what do wey win our life

she did not she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (7568/ 10720) 
umhum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there was something missing in the uh u the child is life you know uh uh that he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building boms and in their basement and mom and dad not know 

Recording: (7569/ 10720) 
umhum yeah wed like to garden and that was one of the things too we want some space to to make a bigger garden and uh no i no we kind of help my neighbor out he is got a big garden next dor so we helpe him and   e is retired oh

yeah 

Recording: (7571/ 10720) 
not specifically no uh sometimes um little groups uf sometimes wei if there is a college in a community when i was running a school leviy campaign um we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign u but it was very difficult  as sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting you knw the are certain little blocks of people uh and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens 

Recording: (7572/ 10720) 
to get them to do what they do to even to help like blind people or tuh um help people that have other physical disabilities um you you can tell from the way the dog is in terms of uh with with the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability uh that they have been trained foro u you can tell whether they have been treated and trained the right way or whatever so

Recording: (7578/ 10720) 
views on a lot of things uh like the it is dry they have u real strict visitation policies things like that and my thought is if you are in if you are if you are considered adult enough to move away then you sould not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college i was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (7579/ 10720) 
what is different ish my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle it was i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oh an tangi village i am right in where i always was i mean i am i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a  full circle there but collumbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat

Recording: (7694/ 10720) 
um umhum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals and the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there or whatever and the kids um they are 

Recording: (7695/ 10720)

mthinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day it was like so trammatizing to them i thik that would be like for four years every day you are just like teased or something like horrible and  like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason

Recording: (7702/ 10720) 
especially the guys yeah 

Recording: (7703/ 10720) 
yeah i um well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work insecure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean ta yeart would come up and i would say ookay here we go you know they are either going ta downsize or they are goin to do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say 

Recording: (7704/ 10720) 
a simple life it is not uh you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregan is not that great but you know they say in ugene that even the dish warshers have pch d ti  well the the uh the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country

think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself races at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things i you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enogh 

Recording: (7761/ 10720) 
they are covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some of she was a us ctis she fell in love through emal over the interdet back in e early like nineteen ninety it was real early and went over there and married the guy uh and so she had some of the medical problems and she immigrated and  u it was just it took years to get that straightened up but she is covered now

Recording: (7858/ 10720)

it was very sudden and unexpected 

Recording: (7860/ 10720) 
and um i think they have a lot to do you know the parks and things like that so um i will just hold it  but i like it because it has art and culture and um it does not feel like a big city 

Recording: (7861/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7862/ 10720) 
i have no idea i remember where i was too in the columbine shouoting because like my friends and i were sitting around drinking a few beers and you know we are channel surfing and you know we see that kid fall out of the window e was lke oh my god  what i is going onn so we just left it on and it was quite  like it was disturbing because i like i was recently out of high school myself and like sure there were fights and stuff but it was always like you could avoid them or you know what tiy mean 

Recording: (7863/ 10720) 
bit the little girl sitting heare going moma you need to go help  seven like seven nine times nine sixty three you knowad her time tables and stuff you knowand so uh yeah i see like younger kids with he kids you know and think you know man you are just not only are you wasteed you you you screwed up your life you are going to you are also screwed up your kids you know i was twenty well i was thirty one when deven was born so 

Recording: (7864/ 10720) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we refer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptems or 

Recording: (7865/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7866/ 10720) 
and he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure in a situation like that things are going to come up but weil we will deal with it 

Recording: (7867/ 10720) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am that i do not have a problem with it and i was in the mensgle club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are tha that are gay as well and that is and and i really made friends with a lot of them i guess i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not even though i am not one of 

Recording: (7868/ 10720) 
uhhum 

Recording: (7869/ 10720) 
that was a grade school 

Recording: (7870/ 10720) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be anone of the above you know if there is at that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (7871/ 10720) 
like i told you i can be an idiote 

Recording: (7872/ 10720) 
so i you pretty much have to be you know can not be middle class ind no york you have to be ether to be richer or not 

Recording: (7873/ 10720) 
but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it is pretty easy like it is pretty straight forward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (7874/ 10720) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called grads and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids 

Recording: (7875/ 10720)

Recording: (7906/ 10720) 
right right right 

Recording: (7907/ 10720) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is wrong i mean there was thepiso 

Recording: (7908/ 10720)

you know we take them to wiandot lake or you know to the zu or all types of things wel yeah we got a the best thing you got to get a membership to everything that is what we figured out we got cos side we got the zu and we got winddot lake and that way you can go whenever you want if an hour end tof the show they are not participating properly you can leave and you you are not out anything yunot yeah yu you know the cosigte is great we really liked that they have really 

Recording: (7921/ 10720) 
uh the reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it is an  incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly aof cours young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers and um i mean their questions in their conversations talk about opinions  is ama 

Recording: (7922/ 10720) 
talk to them like you know thi o be nice the um um 

Recording: (7923/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7924/ 10720) 
o yeah the they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up theu deduction allowances u because even when when wheu reduce deductions it went down ti yeah yeah and then again uh you ould say well you know like uh maybe some affluent uh person would donate in his publicize 

Recording: (7925/ 10720) 
uhuh 

Recording: (7926/ 10720) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (7927/ 10720) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching  t thinnes thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a lot of place bu a lot better place and along with the politicians  they stoped saying now what is really best for the general public and said of what we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (7928/ 10720) 
yeah it is a qualitative type annalasis 

Recording: (7929/ 10720) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference u i can not say from what i have seen the people that went to the catholic schools um they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 

Recording: (7930/ 10720) 
and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when i was about like six years old i think and then they moved up uh to clintonville about when i was about eight now my dad lives up in clinton vill too so 

Recording: (7931/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (7932/ 10720) 
i think the news mediaa hiped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba u unite estates that is found at escee is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castros that is the premice is operating on uh you know and the news media they have not really been up they justy have not been real objective about it i mean uh you kn 

Recording: (7933/ 10720) 
wlli should not know 

Recording: (7934/ 10720) 
i thinkclumbus is really interesting how i how it devel developes compared to like i do not know just like how indian like how columbus is  it is a a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and laid out compared to like philadelphia you know or just  like when it was settled and and when it was made  just ow like more the streets are more it is all like planned out more s opposed to like in in filli wor places like that more east coast it is like the roaads m parts of them are real small and 

Recording: (7935/ 10720) 
and uh i said our our engineers they are not engineers persay but they are teckis that are really into this they they enjoy their work and it is for it is in the four front of ohio government along with the technology there has to elst be the paper work now i do not realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (7936/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7937/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (7938/ 10720) 
well i lived on twelfe maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but at was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couches being burned i saidno 

Recording: (7939/ 10720) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they it is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movements started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to themand i talked to uh high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (7940/ 10720) 
umhum yeh 

Recording: (7941/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7942/ 10720) 
but i think it should be an option you know i am really you know for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a child it would be different but  since women are the only ones that can then it ulti ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every option available especially when you are young no girl should have to go through you know pregnancy and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know 

Recording: (7943/ 10720) 
it 

Recording: (7944/ 10720) 
uhum 

Recording: (7945/ 10720) 
yeah and i think there is a whole bunch of people that just do not want to spend any extra money on anything so we re already payingtm for enough of things yoe do not want to do less 

Recording: (7946/ 10720) 
um the first year they made it in state only um second the second clas that they aregoingnto be starting they have some people from michigan i think

Recording: (7955/ 10720)

Recording: (7958/ 10720)

Recording: (7960/ 10720) 
convenient 

Recording: (7961/ 10720) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (7962/ 10720) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (7963/ 10720) 
um i mean 

Recording: (7964/ 10720) 
see i am i am a i am a i am a professor i am doing studies here and uh 

Recording: (7965/ 10720) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up with as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (7966/ 10720) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed from things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is living uh basically as today as or future where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about tomorrow 

Recording: (7967/ 10720) 
like on noh it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (7968/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (7969/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (7970/ 10720) 
okay it does not have like the equalizerthing 

Recording: (7971/ 10720) 
youe 

Recording: (7972/ 10720) 
i think i would say the same thing because um course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness and um 

Recording: (7973/ 10720) 
if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what hiy mean kind of 

Recording: (7974/ 10720) 
tey 

Recording: (7975/ 10720) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (7976/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (7977/ 10720) 
just i wen  just go back and coppic out something she said uh picking up bat  picking up that child and cuddling it a and having having that baby touch your skin uh and uh uh teaching how what love is uh u you do not necessarily teach love by words but it just by the field that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother the little brother and 

Recording: (7978/ 10720) 
ol i think that is good 

Recording: (7979/ 10720) 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you are going to tell me that fog pushe that two foot pine tree across the way i mean it was a thick tree too  and uh we get up to the next gas station he fills up and listen on the intercam they had news on there weather and stuff tornado warning in that county i turng around andi said n no wil see who is the 

Recording: (7980/ 10720) 
i can see that i you know  like i said for me i kind of i kind of stay where i am so it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more so i mean it does not really affect me personally maybe that is bad i do not vay i would feel guilty about that but 

Recording: (7981/ 10720) 
you know wewill we will take that as an insult 

Recording: (7982/ 10720) 
i do not even know what to say whatd a disgrace it is just embarased they get really 

Recording: (7983/ 10720) 
i think of it is a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns whichave also been to of course ad 

Recording: (7984/ 10720) 
made to face their um their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardend criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (7985/ 10720) 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh heh i i  went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big athing except forove the influx of the you know i didmne realize how many were being drafted or being in listing to the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (7986/ 10720) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were going ta buy a houses in clintan vill to hold them and rent them my problem is i do not have any money so i that down payment ad has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple of condos over on betthel roaad for my kids to live in so my oldest girl when she was geting ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was tha that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so 

Recording: (7987/ 10720) 
ell they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they um try to interveene with their familyd put them back with their family or um maybe call in children services and and i just really do not think much of children services so 

Recording: (7988/ 10720) 
and i mean yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact orf the matter is it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (7989/ 10720) 
to get them thinking about itand then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (7990/ 10720)

Recording: (8025/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8026/ 10720)

Recording: (8031/ 10720) 
definitely yeah like  sad r an that part no differenc 

Recording: (8032/ 10720) 
o 

Recording: (8033/ 10720) 
how would you do this to me r 

Recording: (8034/ 10720) 
yh there is a lot we need to do a lot of evolving  we defitely do 

Recording: (8035/ 10720) 
dos not men 

Recording: (8036/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (8037/ 10720) 
i did have a job like that when i worked full time 

Recording: (8038/ 10720) 
does your husband like that 

Recording: (8039/ 10720) 
yeah it i it is it is difficult 

Recording: (8040/ 10720) 
i think at is bulh 

Recording: (8041/ 10720) 
the cowboys yeah 

Recording: (8042/ 10720) 
ujective 

Recording: (8043/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8044/ 10720) 
and so it became uh a part of everyday life u and the more you see something the more it be becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having and effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereo typical um but i am sure it does have uh some influece because it i think it did it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces 

Recording: (8045/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8046/ 10720) 
um to move forward in my life now what wad happened with the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that worked for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to installed or supposed to have installed that was five feet higher three to five feet highr and uh shouda would a cod a you know if it 

Recording: (8047/ 10720) 
yeah well 

Recording: (8048/ 10720) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the nities that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain things we did or did not do and then it came along with it when our kids grew up then there were so many things that change ats some of the one thing i n stand isout and this his s onlny to do with politics but 

Recording: (8049/ 10720) 
um like i said it would just to be the old generations with the black precident where now it would be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that would be a bigger number 

Recording: (8050/ 10720) 
he is well yeah 

Recording: (8051/ 10720) 
um well one of ththe things i am doing is i am applying for a number of research grants to go to germany and continue my research so hopefully i will get one of those um an i think i am in pretty good shape to get one of those so uh that is that might caused me to put off grad school for a year but i do not think the grad schools will mind if i 

Recording: (8052/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (8053/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (8054/ 10720)

Recording: (8055/ 10720) 
is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 

Recording: (8056/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8057/ 10720) 
no asking each other of opinions or anything like 

Recording: (8058/ 10720) 
right umhum where they get to the clenics sometimes and uh cliniks basically a pill pop an place you know here take these you will feel better you know then they really do not get any satisfaction for what ails them you know thatis side of uh you know you tell you yo tell them you can not drink but get you give them a pill they will giv them  single ffeft you knowum whois

Recording: (8061/ 10720)

Recording: (8063/ 10720) 
it is a lot bigger 

Recording: (8064/ 10720) 
i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (8065/ 10720) 
r like oh english people you are acens so neat and all that kind of thing and then when i went there you know i and this was actually one of my friends but i remember you know she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then she sort of looked at me and she said like oh actually i should not be asking you i do not wan to learn the american way to say those like i went to learn the british way to and people would say things all the time and it was you know they would ask you what youar background was and if you would say well i am american they said well you know like where you are

Recording: (8071/ 10720)

Recording: (8072/ 10720) 
i do not think it is tha cartoons because come on if they are that stupid you know what i mean they they should not even be out on the street i am sorry

eventually get kind of my own business where you know uh i have a want that i want to get a uh ah spiritual book store you know and have uh things for everybody you know to just come it and reading room brouse you know read the stuff you know take time off to relaxe because i think one of the problems with stress is uh and i think people are are right in saying that we do not get enough exercise but uh but 

Recording: (8074/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8075/ 10720) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8076/ 10720) 
papers or whatever 

Recording: (8077/ 10720) 
no it was it was more black than white to tell you truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i live in a neighborhood where it is  it is mostly black than white and that is where i have always lived my whole life 

Recording: (8078/ 10720) 
he is just sitting there okay that is not normal and he comes home you are talking to him yeah it is not like you are here to talk to i 

Recording: (8079/ 10720)

Recording: (8080/ 10720) 
uh case western cleaveland you are not from around here are you 

Recording: (8081/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8082/ 10720) 
when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and most of the cops in the neighborhood knew i carried a gun 

Recording: (8083/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (8084/ 10720) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but um if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (8085/ 10720) 
oh i do not know do it incrementally like you know like lke like do ou like like hear recitationnd then  then n kind of like a work your way of 

Recording: (8086/ 10720) 
il they were here there are many people that were bad egs man 

Recording: (8087/ 10720) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and the education than a um you know than most of probably the people that 

Recording: (8088/ 10720) 
o bord games or it just anything that happens to appeal 

Recording: (8089/ 10720) 
yeah it is and it seems to me that they do not keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of the like just below the absolute best and it keeps a lot of them here 

Recording: (8090/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8091/ 10720) 
do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (8092/ 10720) 
eah 

Recording: (8093/ 10720) 
um my sister had gone a couple times and basically took me aside and i have but one cibbling and um it is it is fun to have a cibbling because nobody is more similar to you than that sibbling because they hade to deal with the inanity that is your family 

Recording: (8094/ 10720) 
have it meeting the missionaries and 

Recording: (8095/ 10720) 
just walk in and start today or you know tell them haw you know the mit strikes over i am gone and so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job so oh yeah three weeks a pay it cost yeah t costs quite a bit of money but te got some strike pay and this and that but it was not a lot you know two hundred dollars a week is not much at all so and when you have a famnu i mean two hundred dollars a week does not pay my day care bill so so 

Recording: (8096/ 10720) 
take that away 

Recording: (8097/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (8098/ 10720)

Recording: (8099/ 10720)

Recording: (8100/ 10720) 
exactly 

Recording: (8101/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (8102/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (8103/ 10720) 
okay i might want to try to adjust this a little bi again if you say it goes under n treck uand underherea tat hope yeah it is probably going o stay better 

Recording: (8104/ 10720) 
oh 

Recording: (8105/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (8106/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8107/ 10720) 
well i have met it a lot more different cultures seeng how a lot more different people lived and found out how lucky i was 

Recording: (8108/ 10720) 
here are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (8109/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (8110/ 10720) 
i think he specializes im likes silarious and ahpx 

Recording: (8111/ 10720) 
l i am i am sure i am sure australia you know welcomes all those dollars but the they have like little like a like a like a wetting industry 

Recording: (8112/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8113/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8114/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (8115/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (8116/ 10720) 
ye 

Recording: (8117/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8118/ 10720) 
and they proceeded to sit i think they set two of our guns o the battery i mean the tiers on fire 

Recording: (8119/ 10720) 
you know and she gets dad 

Recording: (8120/ 10720) 
just 

Recording: (8121/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8122/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (8123/ 10720) 
e you always hear about the bv gn 

Recording: (8124/ 10720) 
yeah i do  well that is fair maybe that is true too i mean i do not feel  because you know when you are younger you think oh my god twenty siven that is so old you must be you know and dout at you re eare or like i sa i i feel five i do not feel  wellt more responsible but other than that 

Recording: (8125/ 10720) 
in high school yeah i haves friends with most of them 

Recording: (8126/ 10720) 
at the beginning he did perfectly but now he is doing this i want wup at four oclock kind of thing and give hem a bottle and thet goes back to sleep but you know i do not want to walk allwy downstairs to make a bottle for him at four oclock sb i can not see feeling my way through the hallways and stuff 

Recording: (8127/ 10720) 
because it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (8128/ 10720) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the attorney got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and uh yeu knh blew it  you know so that was my responsibility my fault but uh you know how it was just uh years of pend up frustration and i just 

Recording: (8129/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8130/ 10720) 
some of the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (8131/ 10720) 
so that is i think that is a problem too you know everybody says well i do ot want toget there at eight thirty you know so 

Recording: (8132/ 10720) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um i yeah i you know i really struggle with that because i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many famiies are going to do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um  sounod like my dad but it seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids 

Recording: (8133/ 10720) 
be really rude not helpful 

Recording: (8134/ 10720) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good day care because theyt work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before you was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or some but in a church when it first started but you know it is just not you know people were always saying ik can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to 

Recording: (8135/ 10720) 
um   it is all  i have learned a lot it is been interesting ihe liked t my coses 

Recording: (8136/ 10720) 
once you are in it you are youave been in it and that is it i have thirty two points

Recording: (8159/ 10720) 
nd that that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs becase that attracts fans people go  nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game

hen dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with the parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being uh shown and and have access to 

Recording: (8164/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (8165/ 10720) 
plus with the inarnet and everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents still cause you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (8166/ 10720) 
she said well well you have to take a foreign language you haveto i said look i am not taking any more foreign languages we are going to figure out how to avoid this or no you have to take it i said look lady there are sixty thousand students in this university and if you think that i am going to believe for a second that they all take forein language classes after having seen the college of foreign language you are insane there is another way to do this experience what is it well you have to take a foreign language i said okay wwe ar going to change the question a little bit here you have two options now tell me how to avoid taking a foreign language or tell me how to talk to somebody who is not you because that is apparently all

yeah you just find it i can do anything i want yeah 

Recording: (8600/ 10720) 
and and i am going to hold you to this confidenciality because very few people know about this 

Recording: (8601/ 10720) 
of at the same time every day yeah 

Recording: (8602/ 10720) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (8603/ 10720)

Recording: (8606/ 10720) 
ynow that is interesting though because i think i think that that my whole i i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (8607/ 10720) 
for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be real interesting and help me feel like you know helping people um they give uh new direction for abused uh wives and mothers and um help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they coan get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that 

Recording: (8608/ 10720) 
o 

Recording: (8609/ 10720) 
i can not i can not believe it i iwill i i you know i thatjst that just blows my mind you can spend all thousands of dollars o have it just for a wedding

oh yeah 

Recording: (8611/ 10720)

Recording: (8613/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (8614/ 10720) 
yeah i mean you know ining oh here you go o um ou the one i think is pretty obvious that the blind ye was something that should not have happened the other one that yeah you just let us face it at that age in at every age we want a leader um and i guess it goes back if we choose toor we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we will make better decisions of who is going ta lead 

Recording: (8615/ 10720) 
whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couplef years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethol and three fifteen nore things like that 

Recording: (8616/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8617/ 10720) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is wright or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was wright or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (8618/ 10720) 
allkay so um christ and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got it in my head that i did not want anybody to call and say how wis your dad doing and so the best way to deal withthat situation was to call im globaly across the board plus it was a fun pychological experiment just as as they go because how often do you get to tell peopleyodds kill himself this morning so i i i hi how o you doing id no i have not talked to yo 

Recording: (8619/ 10720) 
i was like wow  i could not believe it

Recording: (8621/ 10720) 
stay on it 

Recording: (8622/ 10720) 
right and then they wonder whyuh you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that will goldend rule thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (8623/ 10720) 
yeah yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the same upbringing through mess media and and and well malls 

Recording: (8624/ 10720) 
oh i see wel that woud be a good way i would think 

Recording: (8625/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (8626/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (8627/ 10720)

Recording: (8895/ 10720) 
and they see the same thing it is meared back to them because we are made in christs images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is wat we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do posieday and build ing the ost it may have been the smallest part of that sheet of paper

gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (9027/ 10720) 
oh that is neice 

Recording: (9028/ 10720) 
i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know well 

Recording: (9029/ 10720) 
well because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be first to know that there is ah lot of favoritism you know some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other 

Recording: (9030/ 10720) 
the arts it was called  and that was interesting it was  those are it is kind of an under class of teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hour and  in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty 

Recording: (9031/ 10720) 
yea 

Recording: (9032/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (9033/ 10720) 
uh 

Recording: (9034/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9035/ 10720) 
oh 

Recording: (9036/ 10720) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like where they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have is take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to 

Recording: (9037/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9038/ 10720) 
yeah but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and the mother is name was hariet 

Recording: (9039/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9040/ 10720) 
yes but there is nobody at home but my sister and i have so domestic vilit sort afebeen a curious affair so i just figured something weird is going on i did not know what ws going on but at the same time it was all divorce related an just basically dum because the divorce was not going to fase me because the entire marrage was we knew we knew from the beginng that it was a dum idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so we are just kind of waiting around an going e we are going no be divorked t a couple of months and sure enough so any way um so i i looked at these people and their names are thou 

Recording: (9041/ 10720) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people the pets saybut it is just i could not mear around that and im you know i would go off on people that would do that bring that in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth sometimes uh i am not a violent man either even as bigasyou so 

Recording: (9042/ 10720) 
yeaha 

Recording: (9043/ 10720)

Recording: (9045/ 10720) 
um i do so much just not a one of them i just got back from lunch with i mean i see them 

Recording: (9046/ 10720) 
where they are almost segragating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in ae way that is almost segragating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or what not um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (9047/ 10720) 
thinkso 

Recording: (9048/ 10720) 
right yeah yo well you can not even put a price on it either so it is 

Recording: (9049/ 10720)

hen cear paper so when you wrihte on the white copy it comes through on to the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just wrips off the back copy and hands it to his friend so he did not have to write you know if he was not getting the notes 

Recording: (9072/ 10720) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (9073/ 10720) 
do all of the stuff and then you you know pretend that you are a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case but n going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me i  sey my family my mom and dad um well i m um my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungry and that was a neat experience i liked growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasent in hungry uh and he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubed off on me i still do 

Recording: (9074/ 10720) 
value and why are you doing this to my kid uh so i think that is missing and that is a problem withinin the school the public schools uh so ire is just seems to be more distraction from the educational process you mean when you are in the kaslic shoo and you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need toof course art of the  way they deal with it is they take the real problems e send them ove back to the public schools uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it 

Recording: (9075/ 10720) 
you know so unfortunately you know a i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressure is put on schools ind education now 

Recording: (9076/ 10720) 
and i was not real i was more surprised that they found a lot of like alcohol like i would not like you know like some people if they do drugs at school and stuff i am not saying that is right but they will they will do it but like alcoholit would be so hard tt l like hide because it smells you know and you got tw hold it out but they fiund like bottles of licker and 

Recording: (9077/ 10720)

Recording: (9080/ 10720) 
well see my my husband would do that to it is so bisare because is i do not know wis i i acucually do not i think that is where his brain is completely lacking i make i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says i am not a good judge of that you will have to check what because my son wheln my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his scape boarding friends i said where are they oh will they sod they were going down on am i 

Recording: (9081/ 10720) 
in the dorms too and i really i reallydid not like that like it was like i do not know it was like living in a hotel or something it was really weird and like

Recording: (9084/ 10720) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (9085/ 10720) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that  whole thing about um uhh as far as like your student loaans and being able to get into t as helped me you know and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean  i i 

Recording: (9086/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9087/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (9088/ 10720)

Recording: (9093/ 10720) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (9094/ 10720) 
u know but they did not seem to have growng up in this you know terrible environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think a lot more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i 

Recording: (9095/ 10720) 
deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living an working togr different people of different i mean these were alians rather than different  ethnic denominations of humans but it it approach that from a less um uh from a more realistic standpoint and instead of having you kw like an old star trck you know everyone gets along then we come 

Recording: (9096/ 10720) 
isee 

Recording: (9097/ 10720) 
um as far as being heterosexual so i mean i really can not say that i would say that s effecting the kids 

Recording: (9098/ 10720) 
and i think that that is one of the things they can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence a lot of kids it is takin over their life if it is not that now it is worse yet it is the kids are on the inter net now that is even worse because no you can not even hear what they are getting into at lesh on tv you caun walk in and see it and turn it off now you can go in i guess and see what they are on a n inter ndnet on an sy nd i am sorry you  and they inter net anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got to rihte program an

um i mean at that point i i certainly did not have any real knowlege  about any of that sort of thing um you know they covered the basics um they did talk about condums and um contreception i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrased by um i mean i do not really uh they i 

Recording: (9167/ 10720) 
i listen to someone i just touch someone who will be successful you will be successful i th individual and that is what is most critical you yourself hase to do it not the business because from you businesses observe 

Recording: (9168/ 10720) 
and we know that the result could be death then like an it and it is an agressive an aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would obviously because you can not have two uh two aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be agressive and it is response you can not youknowhat i mean so in like a state of war it waus like that so in that context i think but like in the same context i feel  it would be wrong for a solder to 

Recording: (9169/ 10720) 
some of the ordinary peoplenow excuse me wearein we are both into geneology on our respective families and you can find a lot out about your familiys wand you starte doing that in fact you you forgot one that i found i had do not you rememeber we roding that ter library in pennsylvania and i he came back an heur sitting hare lauhing ad i am trying not to laugh out loud and yo sadl what is so funny i love all the names i am looking for from all my family he is 

Recording: (9170/ 10720) 
county yeah but everybody does everything in mansfild because there is nothing to do in ashland but uh the mansefield branch campus roe use there well growing up in mansefield was um uh it was really boring it was really boring um my dad was 

Recording: (9171/ 10720) 
because there is some people that actually can not work 

Recording: (9172/ 10720) 
you mean 

Recording: (9173/ 10720)

Recording: (9174/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9175/ 10720) 
we just agreed to get divorced he went to he you know i did not even see the lawyer he just brought the papers for me to sign and 

Recording: (9176/ 10720) 
taulg about i come home getting the car and go  go somewhere you know or come home and get something to eat and yeah bu  i uh but i think dad has a lot to do with it uh i do not really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching how do hou duty youndow on that stuff and of course it was not the uh bion that stuff maybe you can see on tv now or uh but i do not really think the medias has had that much to do with it it is 

Recording: (9177/ 10720) 
ll this other stuff 

Recording: (9178/ 10720) 
connecting some wires are crossed up here or something and they are aand so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (9179/ 10720) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emery and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvord and then start you know tryg to make it up by working hard or you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you 

Recording: (9180/ 10720) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposly tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from hilard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad

Recording: (9184/ 10720) 
so the it was hard to talk to drunk people 

Recording: (9185/ 10720)

Recording: (9186/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (9187/ 10720) 
um i know that is a lot easier said than done because you fall in lovevryligreg sometimes when you are young um but i do not think it encourages it i just think in you know they show so much on tv it is all you know people are newed on at ten oclock at night on these shows and these girls are watching it  you mean granda most of them are adults but on the soape ropers and stuff it is a different story so they are seeing it anyways um you just i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say

Recording: (9191/ 10720)

Recording: (9231/ 10720)

Recording: (9241/ 10720)

Recording: (9242/ 10720)

Recording: (9244/ 10720) 
eah  got into a situation where you reallyou were not there wis a no wind situation from the gitgo and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became a political war as everybody knows nothing about it 

Recording: (9245/ 10720) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do as simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different 

Recording: (9246/ 10720) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post pardem depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice buiurth control so uh and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (9247/ 10720)

are not really saing much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like to see them see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and that is all settled now and it is just sort of a you know this celebration type stuff well that is not interesting yel iy could change and move the primearis like to may 

Recording: (9252/ 10720) 
well i think the people that made that ball should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more thand two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (9253/ 10720) 
um

Recording: (9255/ 10720) 
right so a lot of them already believe in that they have their own religion and they they are really faithful so that was the one of the main problems is that they um they had been so holding on to that for so long an it is so strong they do not want to let go of and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (9256/ 10720) 
but i finally just said i we are going to start training people to make money with computers so 

Recording: (9257/ 10720)

Recording: (9258/ 10720) 
o ilalways preach get a union job youknow 

Recording: (9259/ 10720)

Recording: (9260/ 10720) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember  wsoim 

Recording: (9261/ 10720) 
uhum 

Recording: (9262/ 10720) 
d they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well there were not really too many other problems i mean the economiis doing really well and forrein relations are always shaky but they are getting a little bit better 

Recording: (9263/ 10720) 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know wis kind of appalling to to the parents and everything i guess maybe that is where i am coming from i mean uh the way some of the uh kids dress you know retro back to and with the bell bottoms and everything to uh and and the uh the persings i just can not get into that you know an some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my guy date at fourteen six fifteen 

Recording: (9264/ 10720) 
maybe it the underlying base 

Recording: (9265/ 10720) 
or they yeah they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (9266/ 10720) 
i actually joined the church in uhs well i do not know it was six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at osou and they were um just asking people if they thought that crist had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i a like well i think so yeah and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while tha i read the book of morm andan i really prayed about it and 

Recording: (9267/ 10720) 
pretty soon you see all the money that they have been making gone 

Recording: (9268/ 10720) 
through downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i would not have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking why why not do that and noh there is also the whole pollution thing and and this types of thing so i thought that was 

Recording: (9269/ 10720) 
second and third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering that is one of the reasons they were not going to move me 

Recording: (9270/ 10720) 
i do not intend to ever leave here so 

Recording: (9271/ 10720) 
soit was one of those

Recording: (9276/ 10720) 
i am going to get done with this i swear 

Recording: (9277/ 10720) 
brang what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff a it does not even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is uh it is a struggle understanding that and uh uh i made it through all four rounds this time and uh  even sat up which was the first time um it is a struggle but 

Recording: (9278/ 10720)

but yeah that leaves he door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (9284/ 10720) 
mosan bilmos he is always saying well this is raious and thatis racious but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know there are places lots worth like the south and so on course uh who who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (9285/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9286/ 10720) 
i do not know just exactly where the others are but theyare here in the collumbus area

r whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these octors also ask for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any appreciable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids

Recording: (9464/ 10720) 
yeah i was cutting twenty pounds in three days 

Recording: (9465/ 10720) 
i wish i knew the answer uh but  reality you know uh i just feel sorry for the the peopler that not only peoe that they have to do that but th an also for the people that are involved in t on the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything the only one i really had to i was really upset with uh was he colembine deal and that was because uh the one kid was making bonds and stuff like that and the basea and the parents knew nothing 

Recording: (9466/ 10720) 
um because he he likes he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yeall but it is hard not to yell i try to talk to him 

Recording: (9467/ 10720) 
ohn nop h i do not feel that at all and they you know we do not hesitate our to get together with other friends and take our kids places i do not remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or so you know i do not remember things like that you know it could have been there maybe but 

Recording: (9468/ 10720) 
in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a metriarky one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would  g goalong with her you know but uh if u if u we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would eand i then and the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life it was 

Recording: (9469/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9470/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9471/ 10720) 
okay how do you how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (9472/ 10720) 
yeah you w a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for an very intellectual interesting environment but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that 

Recording: (9473/ 10720) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a milliaonar with all the lawsuits of different yeah experience with um sexual harassment 

Recording: (9474/ 10720) 
oh you have to nowadays you know i do not understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just does not happen no now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing forty hours a week too so it is it is work and it is a full time job they start she the seven year old just here it is at the end of the year second grade she brings home this project 

Recording: (9475/ 10720) 
i can not argou both sides of that i am at oa luxury i guess where we are in a position where i i trully do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jepardy or he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit and ar be to to to take care of that but having family with him the first year and a half um i do not know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the sixty percent when he was

umhum 

Recording: (9486/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9487/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9488/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9489/ 10720)

it it only took um the last one i did was on richards road which is right across from whetsdon park 

Recording: (9492/ 10720) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like t traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it is more of like ah it is not like an mtv type thing you knoh 

Recording: (9493/ 10720) 
yeah hi actually is is his dad is mother babysits 

Recording: (9494/ 10720) 
o 

Recording: (9495/ 10720) 
i use to think it is a different time now i do not think uh i think everybody is living more for a day in talking about the future you know hoping that the future is there i think there is uh quote unquote uh entime aspect of life you know 

Recording: (9496/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9497/ 10720) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just come in from lyk christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice if they would teach you how to be confident yourself and i do not mean like self esteeme but you know like we said if if 

Recording: (9498/ 10720) 
i really am not educated into that at all so i would not probably say anything since i ould ignorant in the field 

Recording: (9499/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9500/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (9501/ 10720) 
uh it didn did not turn out very well so they switched it over to me uh for a variety of reasons which was not entirely the university is fault uh they had to rely on confidential information which we could not ive em because it was confidential uh by federal law it was confidential we could not give it to them but they needed it so it it was just not a good good way to do business uh 

Recording: (9502/ 10720) 
in what way 

Recording: (9503/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9504/ 10720) 
but it was not the worry about getting pregnant it was he worry about getting aids 

Recording: (9505/ 10720) 
i thought maybe you would like crash one of the with their wedings in 

Recording: (9506/ 10720) 
all the cool appartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (9507/ 10720) 
but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and that will help then permiate the entire society and but it is got to start back here in tet first and i think 

Recording: (9508/ 10720) 
well i am staying on the whole world a they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think that maybe he is found it the same way but maybe not as much as i have i thought when i retired it is going to get this done and this done thand this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got soms done when i got home and i am sure i am doing it just as fast because over and over again people o say i have never seen anybody  wish as much energy you are always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (9509/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9510/ 10720) 
and do not insult us anymore or we will go to trial um so my attorney jumped ut back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth of what they felt it was worth even the arbitrateor was at ashal um but uh that is the way that system works 

Recording: (9511/ 10720) 
my thesis is on the sudatan germans those are the germans who lived in checkasylvakia uh before the second world war and uh specifically i am looking at how they perceved their condition switching from being part of the austro hungarian empire uh and the germans being sort of the the majority uh even though they were not the majority but sort of the the uh the master nation within the austro hungarian empire 

Recording: (9512/ 10720) 
oh doyou mean look there is a tornado over there and right at that time big old pine tree got pushed across you know it is already been broken but it just got nonchelantly pushed across the freeway and he goes that is not tornado that is fog meann it is too far i said what 

Recording: (9513/ 10720) 
but 

Recording: (9514/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (9515/ 10720) 
to their own guilt and um  uh so i have got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh reincarnation the law costs an effect and if a person murders somebody they eed they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made 

Recording: (9516/ 10720) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (9517/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (9518/ 10720) 
i mean i 

Recording: (9519/ 10720) 
which is not far from here so i did that for a while but uh was not very uh satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at huckleberry house 

Recording: (9520/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9521/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9522/ 10720)

Recording: (9524/ 10720) 
from the media uh and i say media broad based as you  be it print media or tv um that has this culture today of um stars and you know media of uh phenomenons and and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not  again i do not know what the the answer is 

Recording: (9525/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (9526/ 10720) 
rigt 

Recording: (9527/ 10720)

Recording: (9536/ 10720) 
mhum yeah it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might ave not 

Recording: (9537/ 10720) 
oh yeah byt 

Recording: (9538/ 10720) 
yh 

Recording: (9539/ 10720) 
that is mean that is why nobody brings it 

Recording: (9540/ 10720) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (9541/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9542/ 10720) 
uh i got thrown out of high school 

Recording: (9543/ 10720) 
d this sort of thing d then you are leaving out a large part of the population so i am not sure it is gong to t give valid resuls anyway 

Recording: (9544/ 10720) 
um i ik i think it fills it is nitch you know i mean i mean wexener has a nitch and the and the museum has a nitch and um i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (9545/ 10720) 
h 

Recording: (9546/ 10720) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (9547/ 10720)

it is about the same 

Recording: (9549/ 10720) 
yeah weh tit was just the usual things to she touched my things  you know  because they were far apartd enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and you know so that and interest so it there was not much of that but there was the usual you know she wis breathing on me in the car he saw a ben too allowed i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have rove net you bent through it all yeah well 

Recording: (9550/ 10720) 
i wonder if that is also of a socialized medicine there it is socialized is not it 

Recording: (9551/ 10720) 
honest i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tubes titers is pretty permanent u but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still nots still much cheaper than they am having kids um and then if they i would give thm more money if they would clean up their act just for them u as far as it being races i do not think 

Recording: (9552/ 10720) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9553/ 10720) 
that is nice 

Recording: (9554/ 10720) 
and tell communication is very much like a highway you need to know what your load is going to be before you constructid or vice you know other was you are planng is a way off well nowadays we are in a position where we are doing more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio and the private network uh as a private sector is still looking atas o looking at us as a show case we are doing voice over ip in a in a netporta call which means weu are doing voice and data over the same pype and 

Recording: (9555/ 10720) 
yeah it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9556/ 10720) 
no and he 

Recording: (9557/ 10720) 
and uh then they h powers thatu be an  american army decided wewill we will grow up to this little area of uh oh it was eirth six month or four months enzo 

Recording: (9558/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9559/ 10720) 
to say you know what i am sick of that is somebong to shoot those people but i 

Recording: (9560/ 10720) 
oh i would say family values customs traditions um divorce moving just looking at my sister my my sister u i mean she is very happily married but myk god i mean they they lived here in columbus he is from dallas they met here they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back now they are in london nd england they

i mheank it is too late i do 

Recording: (9563/ 10720) 
oh 

Recording: (9564/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9565/ 10720) 
i do not think i can answer that 

Recording: (9566/ 10720) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verble and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hampster and i said well you know you make sure you give tim food and water and when it died id i was so surprised that she had not given it been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her 

Recording: (9567/ 10720) 
ell that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is a yo do not need a husband all ye eed is aburn bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9568/ 10720) 
it was not really farming country and he went he went out there from iowa where you throw a corn of like horn out in the field 

Recording: (9569/ 10720) 
oh it is just so evey the environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open ore more receptive to relationships and uh you know i think it is a much friendlier place and then i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just do not have proverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregan it is because they have chosen to live 

Recording: (9570/ 10720) 
just 

Recording: (9571/ 10720) 
y it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (9572/ 10720) 
no i wentten to see her obviously but 

Recording: (9573/ 10720) 
oh my gosh they they do not have any of these like student mattina specials we you  going for like a buck fifty huh 

Recording: (9574/ 10720) 
they they just set up a on a flatbed truck on wall street in new york and do a concert there 

Recording: (9575/ 10720) 
and she was from germany which made it little tough because you know they did not talk about thethu those things over there at all for a long time but um then she became very open with thim and every but everybody knew and that was in the eighties and you know if some kids know it when they are young and growing up you know i do not know if it is best to not say it or to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better than 

Recording: (9576/ 10720) 
yeah i will be starty n twothousand three 

Recording: (9577/ 10720) 
that is great 

Recording: (9578/ 10720) 
r basic where they learn things is theyir peers they do not get everything instilled at home uh that is pretty much what you know i seen talking to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (9579/ 10720) 
k sure you you know youd do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had ta mazage them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dol could have done i am not sure if george dubyau is going to be able to uh because to get the denomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i am pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that i going against what most americans are saying dol i think represented where most americans 

Recording: (9580/ 10720) 
i have yeah i have been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when i moved up to delaware yet is it is a real you know comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9581/ 10720) 
they saw us have difficult times and they saw us saw us our spouses crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you could have be in human relation o they saw thatand they saw their love for one another they saw over night where i  start  caring for my dad because my mother died instantly you know like a short term an hour and now he had a stroke i did notknowhthe  i say all their lives and i had o learnd allf that and 

Recording: (9582/ 10720) 
i think my grandpal goes to church 

Recording: (9583/ 10720) 
ll see 

Recording: (9584/ 10720) 
um honestly it would be i would probably base ha decision basically  political um i can not say i would really hold out against him or anything obviously it is not something i would beack oh good well it s to vote for him since he did that 

Recording: (9585/ 10720) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and en making that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (9586/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9587/ 10720) 
yeah like underground no it is gotten real big like it is still different too there is still like a really big cean and theye are still like a smaller underground cean like 

Recording: (9588/ 10720) 
she graduated last year so uh but she went to she went she was in home study so 

Recording: (9589/ 10720) 
and it only took um less than two months 

Recording: (9590/ 10720) 
instead they pickup on oh so and so as arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age an they sort of give background on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the meedia is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on than they are telling you um so i really do not see a big problem with 

Recording: (9591/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9592/ 10720) 
means then they are just givening them the number that we spent more time doing that uh 

Recording: (9593/ 10720) 
and you have been going to a hih state that whole time 

Recording: (9594/ 10720)

Recording: (9597/ 10720) 
as he was speaking and and as he started to speak i realized to another thing that i really feel has a tremendous inpression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as tha people 

Recording: (9598/ 10720) 
go back and uh u assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values uh i could even so go so far as to say ing chemistry or bottony or pychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and 

Recording: (9599/ 10720)

Recording: (9605/ 10720) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is an insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is ant insane and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind 

Recording: (9606/ 10720) 
if they had a way to care it then fine but leave that up to the people

we do have a mutual thing and young people there you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then you know i think it is kind of 

Recording: (9611/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9612/ 10720) 
i think it is better probably if they do not i meanyo say anything about it you know and most ofhem people will you know like when you get to i lived in to berrics a lot of time but i mean you know a lot of people you know thy get their own places off bace you know and who cares whith that i mean i do not care yo knw like i say i  have gay friends that you know i do not care what they do i mean ii they are old enough to do whatever hec they want to do you know 

Recording: (9613/ 10720) 
i was married but i did not have any kids once youre have kids you anr not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off any time and then when i got my master is i ren into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need toa resource room teacher wunch come up and interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position nd got another position but anyway it all worked out

it is overoff of uh thirty three two seventy and thirty three 

Recording: (9621/ 10720) 
well  and and especially in my situation you know i uh i think about it quite a bit you know if i would have had a more of an opportunity to have a one on one uh relationship with her i probably uh uh being a girl you know could have probably helped her out ind uh ou hat a lot ofsocisocial thing social things you know about men because i i kind of get the impression that she o not really she still ai not very interested in men you know so 

Recording: (9622/ 10720) 
now because like uh i work like i say my supervisor is a black woman now i get along good with her the the other woman is an indian woman i get real allong real good with her the other guy is the black i get along real good with her but my supervisor is got a friend that is a black woman at works in another department now she will come and talk to her and dell have all her work on to us 

Recording: (9623/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9624/ 10720) 
i so i hesitate to see that it would really help them um it would just be better if somebody could you know keep their eyes open or if we had um more counselers or things like that to deal with everything including that 

Recording: (9625/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9626/ 10720)

um 

Recording: (9641/ 10720)

Recording: (9642/ 10720) 
i think they are missing the the point because i am sure there is some runawaywhite teenage girls out there too or mexican or whatnot um 

Recording: (9643/ 10720) 
eh 

Recording: (9644/ 10720)

Recording: (9648/ 10720) 
other person is wrong and  leave it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is eavil he is wrong and i said that is not right dood uh i i honestly do not know um people get really scared there are certain i mean like t there are certain denominations that will take one it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to 

Recording: (9649/ 10720) 
um as far as affiliated with a party i probably repond to um republicans more than democrats but i think given any um given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (9650/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9651/ 10720) 
exactly right yeah yeah and you know a lot of people i work with do not see that and you know they think i am a real cheap skate you know because you know i will i spend money you know an well i i am very selective i mean like uh i would love to go to disney wold and there are people at work that will not go to disney wrold just because of what it costs to get in you know know i drive there i do not fly because i am really that cheap but you know i would love to fly but i just go oh my gosh and you know but you know i will do that but you know like um like at uh thanksgiving time we do not buy a butterball turkey we 

Recording: (9652/ 10720) 
so 

Recording: (9653/ 10720) 
i ended up uh running away from home yeah 

Recording: (9654/ 10720) 
medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in and observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids does not face them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunt your groath and they subdue your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headakes from dexadrine and aterall so i say you know if it works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because 

Recording: (9655/ 10720) 
uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know uh than i would have hat a at a bigger school 

Recording: (9656/ 10720) 
hh 

Recording: (9657/ 10720) 
yeahno 

Recording: (9658/ 10720) 
because i a become unpopular if i have like any time away from my girlfrend 

Recording: (9659/ 10720) 
wariers that are out there men and women that will do that uh more power tone uh all i can do is pray about it and that is what i suggest to everybody else that is the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the nons in high school that taught me had auphoaster on the wall that said more things are raught in this world by prayer than we will ever know 

Recording: (9660/ 10720) 
this little kid who still has a living parent and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line and 

Recording: (9661/ 10720) 
yea 

Recording: (9662/ 10720) 
i know i am  i can not wait because ie the house we live in it is a half double but we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but you know i have like eighty plants in my house now but i just can not wait to have my own space i never plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i am going to leave you know and a 

Recording: (9663/ 10720) 
now wee run an online system where people connect our system and build te data basis or or access the data basis uh it isa the uh  everything os has in their library collection is in our system their records came from us u yeah th well they yeah and we do that for uh tens of thousands of libraries yeah 

Recording: (9664/ 10720) 
uh being here at the university 

Recording: (9665/ 10720) 
but not all of them areh you know are that way 

Recording: (9666/ 10720) 
i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it  you know dealt with in a callm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (9667/ 10720) 
just a job  that is an awsome job 

Recording: (9668/ 10720) 
see ih i he is uh he is just he is in his two s and i like he is got to be in a court or something well because when i am holding his hand taking them he just tends to want to he is not com and collective he is little you know um so like that is why we do not do nothing because when i take hem ton people is houses i can not do that because he will get into everything and i i am i get real stressed out about that i do not i do not 

Recording: (9669/ 10720) 
yes private homes and um actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (9670/ 10720) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (9671/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9672/ 10720) 
i would say probaly the black man 

Recording: (9673/ 10720) 
i have been some places where some men refused to sweat with women sometimes i felt kind of weird about it 

Recording: (9674/ 10720) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (9675/ 10720) 
yeah  that is it 

Recording: (9676/ 10720) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (9677/ 10720) 
right and and also the other thing is you you have to be sort of compassionate because like you know you are you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you spilt something out you want an answer you know each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sine like if i tell somebody you know turna lef tetting three six heyare aland he is spposed to respond ttba three ninety six roger well if it does not respond then i have got to say it again which means instead of ten airplanes i now have eleven i am talking to you because i have to tell talk to him two times each so you know there are some people that get really 

Recording: (9678/ 10720) 
no 

Recording: (9679/ 10720) 
no i mean it is nothing crazy where they think they are got and 

Recording: (9680/ 10720) 
if that happened i would be ten times more understanding and i would say you know i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes 

Recording: (9681/ 10720) 
hey do not do it today unless tha person is a scholler i mean a you kow three point eight road scar or anything hey okay 

Recording: (9682/ 10720) 
m 

Recording: (9683/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9684/ 10720) 
yes but you know what his parents are going to you know really going to let people know that 

Recording: (9685/ 10720) 
and then they physically died before they got a chance to live and whele en their spirit wakes up finds out that they are physically dead and they can not do anything in a physical world any more they want to draw themselves too especially if they were a bad person they want to draw them to the brightest thing 

Recording: (9686/ 10720) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot 

Recording: (9687/ 10720) 
yeah i do not really have any childhood recollections of clifornia yeah 

Recording: (9688/ 10720) 
um well that bathroom i starting to sound good right about 

Recording: (9689/ 10720) 
is got to help here to make the home and i think that that is one of the problems too many people think instead of just getting them to lovelingly help each other because we are supposed to help each other and this goes all right back to thewaty i said do you said at the beginning in school or kindergarten i think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a bottle and rock it and sing to it and put it to bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up teach them how to tige their shooes and take them off teach them how to do  everything ther 

Recording: (9690/ 10720) 
dayso yes in my opinion definitely its eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering a question uh from over the time that tht this kind of thing is roti based apon the word respect 

Recording: (9691/ 10720) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (9692/ 10720) 
p before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and i u there were a few classes that really stood out where you know there was sort of you know you would i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like you know wat what does this american know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers and classes i mean not directly they 

Recording: (9693/ 10720) 
a even republicans were like that 

Recording: (9694/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9695/ 10720) 
it is been completely outrageous story lines and like the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (9696/ 10720) 
just give me a couple of shirts or something you know she always bought my clothes anyway so so just give me a couple  give me whatever you think i need you know i will be here drinking beer watching sports younow 

Recording: (9697/ 10720) 
back there block so it is right near like a lot of  other student housing 

Recording: (9698/ 10720) 
right and i was also robbed about three times delivering pices for dominows in the campus area really uh a couple of times we are down uh a little bit south of campus fourth street and fifth avenue near there fourth streeting seventh and but once was right on practically on campus sixteenth avenue at near high street i was robed there once yeah near 

Recording: (9699/ 10720) 
an i sit theren go you know i tell p fy you lit the ba clinic and everything they got a homeless thing uh over there and i say you know this guy a friend i know you know he is a bein i bet the guys need to get out toimand help him you know i mean you are in more of a uh situation than i am to be able to go out and and an si terim but he wants me take him like marry haven or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is tay te hy sovers up and goes back out 

Recording: (9700/ 10720) 
that goes a lot longer than just giving them that because if they give it they do ot not do with it so i i really i really think uh um a i always say traveling uh people are all of the same world wide they just give them ifferent colors different facial different accents to so god can give them unike characteristics so he can call them his own he knows each other of us but uh we are all the same way satdown 

Recording: (9701/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (9702/ 10720) 
and they fought a lotand there was a lot of violence and then i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i i sweare i have not seen a walt disney movie that does not have violence in it 

Recording: (9703/ 10720) 
they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one doce and they were giving him three doces 

Recording: (9704/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9705/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9706/ 10720) 
i see no i mean it it 

Recording: (9707/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9708/ 10720) 
th drivers are not so insane like they are here like people are a little bit more laid back just because like um i do not know and parts at is really insane but like sometimes just people are just like because it is al because it is nice weather people do not get so like aggravated by like here it is like cold and and gray and you just want to like yellowd people in theur car and stuff or something i do not know i do not know what people is deal with

Recording: (9711/ 10720) 
oh sure 

Recording: (9712/ 10720) 
ell i believe its quality not quantity uh ideally you know uh one parent would be there be it male or female you know man or what mean o uh or lady but uh the you know your quality time is more important you know ymean if you go come home and you ow all you want to do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever you knowand not spend anyu time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are tere for two hours 

Recording: (9713/ 10720)

yeah i was trying to avoid that question rein no but uh i thought you know just get a little insight on what is going on out there in delaware and you know maybe possibly find someone to be with but 

Recording: (9717/ 10720) 
houldno you hve little more knowledge a little more support around you educating knowing self discipline and on what is on  really on top what i is rally beng crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children do not know the dads 

Recording: (9718/ 10720) 
we are having like three concerts the next month 

Recording: (9719/ 10720)

most people i associate with and this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (9728/ 10720) 
there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (9729/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9730/ 10720) 
they went they went to  private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to the high  state um compared to miama university i saw different i see a differences in the standards of the of the students uh but i believe and i have seen it with my son going to high estate that his morals that he is gained through his uh pre college years are staying with them uh and i am very grateful that there is 

Recording: (9731/ 10720) 
exactly 

Recording: (9732/ 10720) 
id not realize that 

Recording: (9733/ 10720) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but you know with aids and at as rampant ed as is now and there is so many more women that have it um started off it was mostly men um women have got to know as at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (9734/ 10720)

but in the winters when you know i mean i do not exercise that much 

Recording: (9739/ 10720)

Recording: (9740/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9741/ 10720)

it is in in education it is it is top they preduce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i will be gone by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for a small schooland they just open up with their phd program in education and they are also knoing for political science but it is a real conservative political science and ike it s a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views

Recording: (9780/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9781/ 10720) 
es umhum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean there there are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know there are cultural things to do in collumbus and it does sort of make me mad when you know people look kind of like  columbus you know there is no not think o to do there i find myself defending collumbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (9782/ 10720) 
rusian beltonbr ug 

Recording: (9783/ 10720) 
not really no i was too proud i would have never i would have never i think my dad paid my first months rent for me though i paid him back and then i never i never wanted to borrow any money i guess t ust growing up the youngest of five i appreciated money 

Recording: (9784/ 10720) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for the kids and but it will not be him running it 

Recording: (9785/ 10720) 
you know compared to any other cities of course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (9786/ 10720) 
they are all at day care th you know youknow they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter who is in a different school scil associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the day care so 

Recording: (9787/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9788/ 10720) 
i mean we went in there one day and you know i explained the whole thing to her and then she puts off some kind of excuse the administrator she says well we do not need problems students like yourself loblabla i said what problem 

Recording: (9789/ 10720) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9790/ 10720) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else it s justt suits me fine 

Recording: (9791/ 10720) 
i mean they they went to the poles and droves you did not have to you know the the the hope there was that they would not go to vote  on the school levey uh but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (9792/ 10720) 
umhum because i want his morals and you know his basic stuff to come from me really 

Recording: (9793/ 10720) 
umhum yeah yeah i would say anything outside like doing that 

Recording: (9794/ 10720) 
you had a harvice did not you

Recording: (9798/ 10720) 
yeah avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do better decisions that help 

Recording: (9799/ 10720) 
well that depends i think i like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites u ind the symphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems u because a lot of the people in that group are paid uh umhum i get i get paid kind of a semi professional a 

Recording: (9800/ 10720) 
and parting sound pretty good so 

Recording: (9801/ 10720) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i houd gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of 

Recording: (9802/ 10720) 
um yeah i mean i have got girls that are that have girlfriends and stuff and it does not bother me i i mean i am not i like men and i i am i am a christian and i just believe that you know you should be you should not god did not put two women on this earth god did not put two men they put a man and a woman to be together to have kids

right 

Recording: (9810/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9811/ 10720)

Recording: (9818/ 10720) 
i talked to all my family my brothers and sisters every day 

Recording: (9819/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9820/ 10720)

some really wacky stuff 

Recording: (9822/ 10720) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (9823/ 10720) 
uh but the dispach the only reason i get the dispaches i do wont know what is going on locally 

Recording: (9824/ 10720) 
answered an ad ind the paper uh but i have sung in the well shan sings in the symphony courus too i have sung in it for sixteen years 

Recording: (9825/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9826/ 10720) 
too much 

Recording: (9827/ 10720) 
like 

Recording: (9828/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9829/ 10720) 
you know my older sister wis a different case she is a little batter but it it is you know as long as you have a good parent it you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father she she did very well 

Recording: (9830/ 10720) 
i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what street it is on 

Recording: (9831/ 10720) 
yeah i do that 

Recording: (9832/ 10720) 
yeah yeah it might be umhum um 

Recording: (9833/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9834/ 10720) 
that was kind of neat though 

Recording: (9835/ 10720) 
so she so i probably di learn a little bit because i i she is still do she is lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i love to cook 

Recording: (9836/ 10720) 
i think that the 

Recording: (9837/ 10720) 
the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just ball them somewhere and di no for but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you i you would kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and you know that would be interestingoh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that um you know if they are if they are caught um in it is any kind 

Recording: (9838/ 10720) 
um so i am sure that ly increases the rate in public schools for 

Recording: (9839/ 10720) 
it is it is amazing and that is something i knew my husb band we always joked about he talks tells his guys at work you know like um you know to take flowers for no reason you know t like like one guy was selling hit was saying somebody was ther aniversary and peter to sad well are goingto take flowers ho am an y guy goes oh i do not know anhe said trust me take some flowers 

Recording: (9840/ 10720) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is it is really he he nurches hem too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (9841/ 10720) 
noer vysic umum 

Recording: (9842/ 10720) 
okay 

Recording: (9843/ 10720) 
and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (9844/ 10720) 
no commitmentif these guys have commitment and you see the guys out there they wan mayby go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe ffill something whatever it is you ask each individual what is that drives you and that is he thing yow i get so perturbt interviewers they aske somebody and then and somebody comes iy saiy you now i mean yeah uh what did now i do not get in side the guy is mind ido not wa what did he mean 

Recording: (9845/ 10720) 
well they are supposed to do more too but by the time they get the fourth grade they are so busy trying to be the class clown they decide it is a lot more important to impress your friends thand it is to fill your mind with knowlege 

Recording: (9846/ 10720) 
oh 

Recording: (9847/ 10720) 
she just used the word penalty uh penalty hasm lots of different definitions each individual has a mental picture what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences ih i want to take just and you say penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left let us come back to about the middle i am 

Recording: (9848/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (9849/ 10720) 
okayi i i 

Recording: (9850/ 10720) 
and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god and believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is very the very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this like yeu said me me me and i got to have this and that status symble stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in 

Recording: (9851/ 10720)

Recording: (9853/ 10720) 
understood what i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that is what i believe my faith is my faith is is faith it is believing that things happen that you can not explain there is it is believing that uh you are doing what you are doing is right so religion is a real big part of my life

it is ai wit is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how tread mill training affects ambulation and people wa spin al quit injury 

Recording: (9856/ 10720) 
i think so i think so um it is it is so sad to see a girl you knowm have so many options closed off ou know i do not mean it is by any streatch sthat it is a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (9857/ 10720) 
definite ideas aboutrnor everything 

Recording: (9858/ 10720) 
you were you were here for a reason and you were herein the unitedstates for a reason of all the biatitudes you have here do not you think it is time to share some of those things the talent and to not necssarily be recognized for those things but you know some some personalities required personality this is the way it is but uh to do things wiout expecting something in return that would be so nice to see that ritten on magazine forents ohh we are 

Recording: (9859/ 10720) 
you know because when you are overseas it is a different environment 

Recording: (9860/ 10720) 
oh i take the little ladies i take to church 

Recording: (9861/ 10720) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal team and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost at much younger than seventeen you know  a eleven twelves like o  we even look 

Recording: (9862/ 10720) 
here is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help exspecially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but you know you it is like a identification thing you know

so 

Recording: (9867/ 10720) 
i should have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for moey or previously do not work for money or something obnoxious and stupid like ay franchise for money i am in favor of that i come up with a good system by which to do things i sell it to you you go do those things i sit tare on and make money off of your efforts yeay that so 

Recording: (9868/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (9869/ 10720)

Recording: (9870/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9871/ 10720) 
ind my own cevillian terms i said why would you want to give an original you know why would you want t give up an original and have a copy because all these others want to be what another would yo you fell christianity 

Recording: (9872/ 10720) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (9873/ 10720) 
the same thing you know i think they are terrific for the right things yeah 

Recording: (9874/ 10720) 
i am going to let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be catholic great if he does not that is 

Recording: (9875/ 10720) 
as much probably 

Recording: (9876/ 10720) 
humum 

Recording: (9877/ 10720) 
and then but the whole band and the cherlers went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart renching 

Recording: (9878/ 10720) 
yeh 

Recording: (9879/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9880/ 10720) 
oh 

Recording: (9881/ 10720) 
yeah um the second thing would be uh the um cultural activities that we have um i wexener center would be one of my primary ones because there is so much going on down there but the art museum and um uh oh right the cultural art center and columbus music hall i mean there is just a million things 

Recording: (9882/ 10720) 
soumhum my you know to me the thing that hurt me the most out of is they want to put caps on our salaries so i am at the highest scale i can go right now as far as job title i there is no other job i can move to untilless i move into supervision or someg upin hat and i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are going to put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now 

Recording: (9883/ 10720) 
it is good money yeah um one idea that i just had recently is medical and farmaticist which is a person who has an md and does computers since those are my two main interests i thought doing both would be really cool 

Recording: (9884/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9885/ 10720) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (9886/ 10720) 
but you are working now janit 

Recording: (9887/ 10720) 
whatever you are going to get away with 

Recording: (9888/ 10720) 
like the continent 

Recording: (9889/ 10720) 
really and it is the summer 

Recording: (9890/ 10720) 
wow 

Recording: (9891/ 10720) 
uh college without the tuition 

Recording: (9892/ 10720) 
and then uh after so long a time after i do not know how long they again the powers that  b you said will we will fool upand we will fog up that whole area with smoke 

Recording: (9893/ 10720) 
a 

Recording: (9894/ 10720) 
they  they definitely struggle they they do i  i think to be that high up obviously you are goingto come in contact with powerfll people rich people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the republicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (9895/ 10720) 
he misses and hits my window tough luck bob yeah 

Recording: (9896/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (9897/ 10720) 
nless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (9898/ 10720) 
stuff and every day there was a new twist on this story that or the c the news was that there was not a news twist yeah i do not care but you could not turn it off because that is all that was on 

Recording: (9899/ 10720) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more than most kindergardeners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedual right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer w 

Recording: (9900/ 10720) 
mhum 

Recording: (9901/ 10720) 
uh and at least it gave you a lot different view 

Recording: (9902/ 10720) 
you know and and it is just i think that in that happens so often there is so many people or even that whole thing with bok it an when you are talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (9903/ 10720) 
being turned away 

Recording: (9904/ 10720) 
i am not real big on the denominations because i think that  i think that is sort of goes against what the original intent of of christianity was i i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and the denominations that are just are ae just  ind of i do not like them 

Recording: (9905/ 10720) 
yeah b my oldest she is the oldest um she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees them um and then they got two other girls and they live togetheri got a house you know they are on they are going through marrage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got a older 

Recording: (9906/ 10720) 
umhum at this point um i am not a uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would  move to a suburban area until collumbus gets their act together they are in so such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the collumbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their scores up um they will you know 

Recording: (9907/ 10720) 
yeah and uh see the darmoe 

Recording: (9908/ 10720) 
at um i think it was mount carmell we went over the weekend and we went there satturday morning and i have got this forty five minte altrasound tape of the baby which is cute because you can only see parts of it but you can really you can see it is face you can see what it looks like and everything but i sid do not want to know thi sax and it is so hard to because we are looking of course we are going through this tape trying to see if we can see anything and you just  you just cat tel i think she was real careful to make sure that that we would not be able to she says i know what it is but i sai all right well do n do not till us so som that 

Recording: (9909/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9910/ 10720) 
they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about thi stick and it was only about painting 

Recording: (9911/ 10720)

Recording: (9913/ 10720) 
i do that every once in a while just like when i get bored 

Recording: (9914/ 10720) 
and they i actually offered an early retirement because the funds i do not you may not remember about three years ago f four years ago the the federal government was not going to pass a budget and all the stuff so when that does not happen on budget actcally cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that which was actually more money than they were going to give us before tha uh so they had to they were  have gong to layoff people or offer retirement so i took the retirement becase 

Recording: (9915/ 10720) 
wriht then they had to after that they had ther lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do ot knowhit it would be worse knowing that you were going to get a notice and being able to prepare for it or i uh because i have had friends that gotten uh numbers and everything you know and and getting a high number and sayting yo ere going ol mye god so 

Recording: (9916/ 10720) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (9917/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9918/ 10720) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dinasty i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourist like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked tho

Recording: (9923/ 10720)

Recording: (9937/ 10720) 
d then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9938/ 10720) 
a 

Recording: (9939/ 10720)

umhum umhum 

Recording: (9945/ 10720) 
i can not see a lot of substance uh he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then tond it backn not really backtracks it is just like it is not anything really firm i mean with mackaine and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what the points they wanted to make and i i do not hear that coming from bush 

Recording: (9946/ 10720) 
um i m iave lived in columbus my entire life thirty four years um born and raised on the west side of columbus um 

Recording: (9947/ 10720)

Recording: (9948/ 10720) 
he was lucky 

Recording: (9949/ 10720) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a level if you are exchanging hours for money or time for money then you are havea you findant amount of time and that is 

Recording: (9950/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (9951/ 10720) 
hum 

Recording: (9952/ 10720) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9953/ 10720) 
 

Recording: (9954/ 10720) 
i do because they were not you know they were not in their children is lives enough you know they were not talking about things being open about things at dinner you know and finding out about school um i you can not blame them for having a side on the nor no not too me parents would know that that they their kids you know um but no i think i i put the blame on the parents 

Recording: (9955/ 10720) 
anow i guess the is still going to build it so 

Recording: (9956/ 10720) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (9957/ 10720) 
that is that is yeah s developetmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now theyhe found out that the full dominance does not take over until about eaige eight 

Recording: (9958/ 10720) 
yep 

Recording: (9959/ 10720) 
not really but i think living an the bible belt as she did she was living there ten years before she married and uh got involved in a youth group and i think that that was very influencial on her decision and so she was not married in the church all my other children were but you know she is she is going her own path and that is fine with me she is very good girl i am she is very conscientious and 

Recording: (9960/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (9961/ 10720) 
it is just ot of your control and i mean like yiu said i mean that is sort of kidis for you i mean they just obviously they are gon no be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (9962/ 10720) 
it was part of that i started restling because a lot of my friends did 

Recording: (9963/ 10720) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it is i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no eas answer uh and you know i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is and i i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily u i i i do not know it is a tough one and i  you i mean your daughter s is daughter is yoaknw it 

Recording: (9964/ 10720) 
oh the japanese come too

Recording: (10036/ 10720) 
uso like there is no there is not a lot you really can really do with that 

Recording: (10037/ 10720) 
i think the latter i do not think it will make any difference the kids that i know in junior hig and in in you know college uh it just does not make any difference to them and they do not like those classes they think they are boring they think it has no relevance to their life 

Recording: (10038/ 10720)

Recording: (10041/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (10042/ 10720) 
putting tat gogether an network itself and we had   you think of a party line system or het t used to call it dasy chaine in industry uh you had to wait and waitn for your turn to get on to a data network and uh we got down to the point where we went to a spoake network where everyone had a dedicated pipe 

Recording: (10043/ 10720) 
umhum uhum 

Recording: (10044/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (10045/ 10720) 
andu so they went up there but the germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot and that area of ensio was just flead us this stable almost for an area back from the middetaranian back probably ten miles and there is ten or twelve miles long to the coast along and uh so wie we had enough area to mit 

Recording: (10046/ 10720) 
ot know because i am sure there are gay boys that are not knowng what is going on with themselves that are in school and and i i have never really understood i do not i never really understood if they were born like that or i i h just never really understood that to tell you truth  so i would not you know i would just i if i was a teacher i would just talk to talk to them and you know tell them to do whatever 

Recording: (10047/ 10720) 
columbus umhum i went to i ended up  in a alternative school system all along i was i got into the lottery they used i i made it into every school i applied for 

Recording: (10048/ 10720)

Recording: (10049/ 10720) 
no she is she still lives down here my other sister has two nice and my nephew 

Recording: (10050/ 10720) 
so it was fun  yeah 

Recording: (10051/ 10720) 
it is not the exact same as they class was in the marksis sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in in real terms and things i think re 

Recording: (10052/ 10720) 
difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (10053/ 10720) 
yor 

Recording: (10054/ 10720) 
high school mariwana acid mushrooms 

Recording: (10055/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (10056/ 10720) 
i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your landlady and then  w it will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was going to move out when she graduate from high school and changed heir mind so i just run that one but it the bottom line is i i just got a second morgage and i have a guy that i worked with that helped me buy those and without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but 

Recording: (10057/ 10720) 
uh the area i live in  now is the westgate area uh we grew up on the hill top area but i now live in the westgate which is a little further west 

Recording: (10058/ 10720) 
umhum 

Recording: (10059/ 10720) 
stuff at christmas but it is not so much you know and and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean therare there is not that at all i mean at least in you know my experience there and i mean i can not imagine because you know western europe i think is sort of as much like america as you can get probably you know most places elsewhere in in the world and i mean that would have been a fantastic experience 

Recording: (10060/ 10720) 
it is not going to work 

Recording: (10061/ 10720) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch ii i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (10062/ 10720) 
that is good 

Recording: (10063/ 10720) 
is i 

Recording: (10064/ 10720) 
because you do have to hive a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (10065/ 10720) 
mhum 

Recording: (10066/ 10720) 
it is it is unifying and i just wish they but i guess there is a rule out there i have ask uh abc news why they can not promote the uh these uh you know they they show the rostraher here is their great point n average engineering major fine tell me what themajors are tell what these kids are what r they plan on doing they are not all going to make it to the professionals then what to do o do afterwards they get token jobs because they are connections 

Recording: (10067/ 10720) 
but they would not youknw because my daughter was like am real bubbly outgoing you know people person and she got by with so much at school but she is you know worked it is worked out fine with her  with both of them actually

Recording: (10070/ 10720) 
t now i amgon to like i am like the press ese like mand i guess a i guesy few months here an now i want to just go you know  is like wan to get siked up i have not decided eke i i because i heard like you there is some pol tole me wellae you know if you wnt to be like a you e you can eaven b like do uh teaching over there like teach english or r yuae going to be a nanny it is like s o you know it is like if i you know the right right right uh position opens up i i may not be be coming back any time soon really

Recording: (10263/ 10720) 
a big mistake i got to college and it just went down hill i had all that freedom and that i had no clue how to study and it just went to hellan hand basket summer um spring quarter i switched my major into music because i am extremely musically inclined is one of the gifts that i have gotten and um that uh that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realized that just like acting you are all good ninety 

Recording: (10264/ 10720) 
i was born in brooklin new york 

Recording: (10265/ 10720) 
there is literally you know hundreds of library publications uh and it is a problem that librarians are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (10266/ 10720) 
and like i say i do not i do not believe that homosexuality is taught um i think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be justified 

Recording: (10267/ 10720) 
i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared  kind of shakeng up by it but um no they are very very serious about designated drivers 

Recording: (10268/ 10720) 
ye the big things 

Recording: (10269/ 10720) 
but there were one or two eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put hours worth of research into then sketch and i mean it was just 

Recording: (10270/ 10720) 
um 

Recording: (10271/ 10720) 
and uh maybe that is why you know it is like that but 

Recording: (10272/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (10273/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (10274/ 10720) 
rightyeh 

Recording: (10275/ 10720) 
yeah 

Recording: (10276/ 10720) 
but it is a uh smaller casslic school you know in saint luis so 

Recording: (10277/ 10720) 
yeah that that is one of the drawback 

Recording: (10278/ 10720) 
if not you just get there the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and this and that but when you obviually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (10279/ 10720) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (10280/ 10720) 
right 

Recording: (10281/ 10720) 
just because you know it was more like they seemd like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the text book they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notts like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um d so i think it it s when people have real enthusiasm and like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not the 

Recording: (10282/ 10720) 
acondaminium or something one floor playing 

Recording: (10283/ 10720)

Recording: (10379/ 10720) 
umhum yeah it is an owowat t was an oli sore that the shuer got rid of years ago but 

Recording: (10380/ 10720) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and trye to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home too because i had friends whose parent mothers were not there and they had to clean they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feeld that they kind of missed out on things u but i think you know kids a lot of them who have when they parents have money and

it does 

Recording: (10699/ 10720) 
too long or a sentence that s a fragment and it is not a complete thought you are not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them  just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you oh well i had a

Recording: (10703/ 10720) 
umhum but that is kind of it it you know it kind of came through where they were like uh when i was growing up we had the uh uh you know you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your uh we were called deds you knoh uh and i was kind of like in the middle you know i i played a little bit of support you know but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads you know and everything so uh so like i say i you know i was kind of a associated
