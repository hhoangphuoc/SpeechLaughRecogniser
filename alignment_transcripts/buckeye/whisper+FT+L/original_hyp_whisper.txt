Recording: (23/ 10721)

Recording: (24/ 10721) 
because you know the sun itself already plays all these adding games and subtracts games and leather games and you know at least the day care all this stuff they had have on their computer as all education stuff it is not game game it it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (25/ 10721)

Recording: (27/ 10721) 
i think that is kind of where i am coming from jan and i know you uh jan and i mean what my sister does i just say to her i just do not really admire it i can not give as much just she gives like i just do not have that same spirit she has but uh it is great to see i mean she is real she really when she just with the people i do not know i have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and 

Recording: (28/ 10721) 
i am the older

Recording: (33/ 10721) 
you know i think a lot of times you know people are not real rational as far as as who they they go for 

Recording: (34/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (35/ 10721) 
you know with the system 

Recording: (36/ 10721) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something i do not wanna deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean people in the same sex or living together or married or what not uh that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that uh 

Recording: (37/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (38/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (39/ 10721)

uh 

Recording: (48/ 10721) 
i mean there people think cars will not run 

Recording: (49/ 10721)

Recording: (50/ 10721) 
it is all of that human being if they want to change if they got their minds set on they do not want to be with you know their other sex i do not think you know can change yeah that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (51/ 10721) 
oh well we really wants to go he lives in california that is for that family i told you about was he and when he is fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back bac so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work in so that we can not even i mean we do not need to have the time but we just should be at least a little out of debt you know yeah something 

Recording: (52/ 10721) 
yeah i know well the disney goes up them but such a shame 

Recording: (53/ 10721) 
something like that i i do not real much about it 

Recording: (54/ 10721) 
and it is if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebel 

Recording: (55/ 10721) 
with that situation 

Recording: (56/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (57/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (58/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (59/ 10721) 
you know i was sitting down uh in my boyfriend is room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone i had my computer on but nobody was sitting at it 

Recording: (60/ 10721) 
so i you know they pile hey you resemb that remark you know 

Recording: (61/ 10721) 
for me to even think about <laugh> 

Recording: (62/ 10721) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like my black ass and all this you know they are prejudice now she is doing this yelling about being they are president if he wants her because she does not boy she do not understand the damn job 

Recording: (63/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (64/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (65/ 10721) 
the ultimate would probably be a part type thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work we have some friends that do that where or they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (66/ 10721) 
except for their names have changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (67/ 10721) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a specialized certificate you are sort of five kindergarten to twelve so i did several years in high school when i was first out of college i did high school first and then i went to elementary well kids from elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that 

Recording: (68/ 10721) 
they have always been there i mean you know i do not really care what the uh guy is specific thing is if he is in the box hole with me you know and is on you shoot a gun <laugh> you know i mean i could carry my i have got gay friends you know so 

Recording: (69/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (70/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (71/ 10721) 
<laugh> it really is great 

Recording: (72/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (73/ 10721) 
they will be naked but they will still go in with a huge tele on 

Recording: (74/ 10721) 
i mean uh like uh what is his name that that we wrote the book i just 

Recording: (75/ 10721) 
which could change 

Recording: (76/ 10721) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (77/ 10721) 
i have not taken him that yet 

Recording: (78/ 10721) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your oriyou can be converted to homosexual you know i personally do not believe that so it i you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this comes comes from but since i think they are wrong <laugh> i 

Recording: (79/ 10721) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she just has a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (80/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (81/ 10721) 
but i am using means example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me wrong 

Recording: (82/ 10721) 
yeah he 

Recording: (83/ 10721) 
i just did not want to do that a lot of people do that but you know it is just such an investment then when you leave and 

Recording: (84/ 10721) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i i do not even know because to start it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is going to be everybody all together that has to right because it cracks me up because we are so concerned about alien this just poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care and here is just 

Recording: (85/ 10721) 
oh my gosh 

Recording: (86/ 10721) 
her house in india is like it is mentioned and they have servants there i mean it is really impressive just the house they just worth more so you can not getting much houseier but yeah everybody is doing well <laugh> 

Recording: (87/ 10721) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (88/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (89/ 10721) 
that is fine 

Recording: (90/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (91/ 10721) 
not as an individual uh well see that is a problem i am it is hard to find a balance betweenika and you know free of information in as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running oh which i i actually kind of enjoy watching them once in a while they get it is it is kind of interesting to watch these people uh but 

Recording: (92/ 10721) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (93/ 10721) 
but the more time i had off it 

Recording: (94/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 10721) 
so i keep it was it but then the move well there we go 

Recording: (96/ 10721) 
but you do not really have to work because they are there apparently 

Recording: (97/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (98/ 10721) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day in time when there is appeal to help me centrating they look at it like well my my friend is out to do it and said well i know i have not have them to do it you know <laugh> they look at it like it is a big pain because i got to run over to the nurse and 

Recording: (99/ 10721) 
you do not you do not use coupons 

Recording: (100/ 10721) 
and apparently that is the way of conditioning in conversation uh one of the guys that i usually go clubbing with he is the one that got me into the little stick dancing and he said uh said there is this like a sign that says come it on me and i am like oh great that that is that is what i need and that does not bother me that does not bother me i just i just i sort of i am just like now you know i am great if they start if they start getting really you know really pushy about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is funny funny because i will get in a conversation with them and they will be like you are straight are not you i am like yeah 

Recording: (101/ 10721) 
and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were i am in each other and uh he sort of pushing me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told them i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that 

Recording: (102/ 10721) 
uh blue diskout 

Recording: (103/ 10721) 
oh not very right now and i twenty twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau i was working statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them how easily they are misinter puted and my wife uh has been the director of institutional research at the university uh data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there uh 

Recording: (104/ 10721) 
like do not go out <laugh> you betty much you are tvs you are entertainment for the year 

Recording: (105/ 10721) 
that it is still really going on you know and his parents accepted him 

Recording: (106/ 10721)

Recording: (107/ 10721)

Recording: (110/ 10721) 
i am not sure it is usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i do not know 

Recording: (111/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (112/ 10721) 
go ahead and she she goes ahead and gets her dishes out and she does but unless i assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of these she goes ahead and gets her dishes out and she puts them right and then on that tank uh with those other dishes makes it a way for us to clean them and and i i i have seen this in many many many incentitive but i am going to be going to be this is a very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society 

Recording: (113/ 10721) 
i was thinking of grandchildren 

Recording: (114/ 10721) 
i think he is in prison and uh he has no driver is license privileges for life and you know it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff 

Recording: (115/ 10721)

Recording: (119/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (120/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (121/ 10721) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (122/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (123/ 10721) 
but neither that they are into goes back to uh you know the quality or the corner or anything i mean obviously just poor kid you know apparently was from this point of his life that he was going down the stairs in the you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his neir van or whatever you know and uh and his parents never close ooh or if they did it did not care you know 

Recording: (124/ 10721) 
again gets back to the ten percent tiding and uh uh i think it is something else in the bible where you know she the lady gives gives only a small course compared to large portion but in relation to what her income was they meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need to promote more of that if we are going pocket things and materialized we need to take more of that but i think right take home and i what would you be doing if you were a third world country did not have choice 

Recording: (125/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (126/ 10721) 
not right now i am kind of job motivated 

Recording: (127/ 10721) 
sfabisant 

Recording: (128/ 10721) 
and it is 

Recording: (129/ 10721) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had apple up see they would lock you in the closet and throw it to key we would let you out most of the parents i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids of the stepparent

yeah 

Recording: (134/ 10721)

Recording: (136/ 10721)

<laugh> 

Recording: (200/ 10721) 
which they have to

i think it is because parents are at work and they are busy making money and they are not teaching their kids any i mean they are not teaching them to say thank you and please and just them normal you know uh thanks for having me when you go to someone is house just the normal i can not tell you how many kids i have picked up and driven home when i picked up my son because it was raining or something and they just jump out of the car and go by by the door i turn to my son and i go do not you ever do that to someone is mother now how bad 

Recording: (202/ 10721) 
it is these uh the that has a set up where um they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (203/ 10721) 
i mean you do not know anything behind it or what is going into it why would you do something like that 

Recording: (204/ 10721) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (205/ 10721) 
so we have a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it

or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (215/ 10721) 
nothing about or or if they did they did not even think anything about and i do not think that behavior is uh appropriate for uh sixteen seventeen year old kid hm 

Recording: (216/ 10721) 
just a little hard to accept uh you know and it is it is it is hard to know what he is going through or how much of it is um normal teenage rebally and and how much of it is just 

Recording: (217/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (218/ 10721) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he would do a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (219/ 10721) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of the kids i mean they obviously they are going to get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parents is fault i mean i do not there are a lot of people i mean i interest in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting cabin a couple of years ago and they just came diverted on it and the parent like left it in the top of the tooshed that was locked in the cage where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked and he ended up shooting himself with it 

Recording: (220/ 10721)

Recording: (225/ 10721) 
of a particular uh facility voicein data 

Recording: (226/ 10721) 
uh originally from indiana but i lived up in uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleveland center which is an air route drive again ball right to all right and i moved from there to i have state airport and i worked there for nineteen years and uh then i transferred to poor columbus 

Recording: (227/ 10721)

Recording: (231/ 10721) 
sure have uh ten or ten oclock in the morning i do not care and there is no compromise with him 

Recording: (232/ 10721) 
yeah they are very quantity as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is held out bottom line in the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like the this and that i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i cannot stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well they will in in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire an new employee and if you have constant turnover and things like that then and if you have a product then 

Recording: (233/ 10721) 
it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was which was which great for me i mean everybody my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom would do fun stuff and then and and i do not i never remember them being negative

Recording: (235/ 10721) 
i worked for a company called highlights for children 

Recording: (236/ 10721)

Recording: (242/ 10721) 
would like to be treated 

Recording: (243/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (244/ 10721) 
i do not know i mean in it was my money so why should it matter 

Recording: (245/ 10721)

thirty nine 

Recording: (247/ 10721) 
uh i do not even think i would want my kid to go to day care <laugh> 

Recording: (248/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (249/ 10721) 
we do not do that here and i said i noticed you know uh there is a lot of black pocket population here or uh creonmixed and that type of thing i mean which i would consider colored not black uh to me black is black if you have anything mixed in your is color um but he said uh we do not do that uh he said problem in the state is gosh you guys got got everybody in this guy he wants to give him his car and give him 

Recording: (250/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (251/ 10721) 
absolutely 

Recording: (252/ 10721) 
that is it 

Recording: (253/ 10721) 
umhum right 

Recording: (254/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (255/ 10721) 
you can know that to possibly you do not you you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you on because you know the the word has to get out that we do not have that much money <laugh> it does not pay yeah 

Recording: (256/ 10721) 
for like summer projects or something 

Recording: (257/ 10721) 
so and i figure i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figure that would be a decent i mean it translatesates over because we are in the past hours it will get on that stuff there but it it is it is like i am halfway to three fourths down with uh with my degrees so if if i wanted to transfer now it would be like because it after this point if i stay any longer then a lot of the credit card will not transfer be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half 

Recording: (258/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (259/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (260/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (261/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (262/ 10721) 
even in the package of information 

Recording: (263/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (264/ 10721) 
but i have been in situations where people of cold races jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny please do not tell them any more in my presence do what you want one you are with your other friend but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blonde jokes i find those sexist and racist in a way and i do not i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working in an office they 

Recording: (265/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (266/ 10721) 
people want a number they do not want to know the methodology that goes into it or the the disclaimeders of footnotes they do not want to read the footnotes they want a number uh when i worked for the state one program i worked on was a occupational employment statistic so it is just collecting uh numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas iowa uh which actually used originally started here at the university you know i it was a federal program department labor at this midwest rate state level and 

Recording: (267/ 10721) 
white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money in involge but it is it is not so much money that it would erratically change your life in that sort of 

Recording: (268/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (269/ 10721) 
it is up to him to raise all the 

Recording: (270/ 10721)

if you have specific questions we are never going to get to them 

Recording: (274/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (275/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (276/ 10721) 
uh because there is not like uh like i could find lead lead person because it is just one person doing it most of the most of the time i mean like people do have groups that play like texan el beat or more in and music but it is not like a beat singer who like you know it is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (277/ 10721) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do i mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an extravagant or who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job um who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then the other people uh 

Recording: (278/ 10721) 
like you are doing interviewsies

acumcumbils or whatever you know and uh you know he is pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because uh i was right 

Recording: (296/ 10721) 
they get caught with that stuff or and nothing happens and it just does not such a horrible example that here you have got you know some regular some eighteen year old kid that does not really stupid but and he is ten years in jail and then you have got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can you get back to the you know and you just it is just it is so it rugs <laugh> 

Recording: (297/ 10721) 
to come in to make came with our neighbors life years ago you knew everybody in in town well the town i grew up from a summer station i do not know if you like oh tenylvania town or not but it is <laugh> a very big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (298/ 10721) 
hi johnny bye 

Recording: (299/ 10721) 
and then it is different businesses like white castle or pizza one of the pizza places and uh some of the super markets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to uncle berry house and they do not have a way and so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know group of volunteers that go out and pick these kids up take them to hunkydary house

Recording: (312/ 10721) 
huh 

Recording: (313/ 10721) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on in high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of bagging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is really easy life 

Recording: (314/ 10721) 
uh but see his father lived right around the corner and they have even had nothing to do with them

Recording: (446/ 10721) 
uh we are more and far less agriculturely related uh we are more and more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation uh so uh a man in uh uh a man or one man in free phrase a woman can do most of the work as being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as agricultural people uh and once again though that would bring people back

Recording: (640/ 10721) 
yeah high school a lot of people are really near minded and work on really trying to fit in college people are more open idea and they go been minded and they are more willing to express their own ideas 

Recording: (641/ 10721)

Recording: (649/ 10721) 
um i have a dakota card it what it does is it makes it dec codes the devd right away rather than sending it through the processor so it is it is a lot faster it does not depend on my process every time like it the movie does not skip or anything it it just goes straight through oh uh oh what do you do you have like meetings and then you talk about computer stuff or um yeah 

Recording: (650/ 10721)

Recording: (730/ 10721) 
i that went that went there for class center in high school and that was something that was exciting for me but that is totally all the question for me now because i have a kid and there is no way i would do that

Recording: (733/ 10721) 
um i mean nothing is happen to them and i mean like you say the getting a high part of it is not so much of the problem it is just what goes into do it 

Recording: (734/ 10721) 
yeah it is well basically it is like a it is about the size of a small hotel room and then it is got separate back yard with like a big back tub and there is like these are like oh it is a room in the little box in the wall about this bag that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is no enough room where people can come in sit down there is like a full out couch bad for whoever in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born

yeah i do because some boys might not wear them because they do not have put them on or i do not know i am not sure because i am not a boy maybe some boys will experience with it before they he originally uses you know i am not but i do not think it is it is encouraging them at all at the same time they should be telling them they should not have sex or a marriage you know but 

Recording: (739/ 10721) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you want to do or you know and and i guess there is different phase like uh massachusetts higherucky what is that the uh the higherucky of needs manly uh massahow anyway 

Recording: (740/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (741/ 10721) 
and just you know sort of doing the same old same old every day there was always something different i guess to be outside and it was just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (742/ 10721) 
guns should definitely be kept in the lock box where kids can not get them besides that there is not a whole lot that government can do it is more of the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids hands 

Recording: (743/ 10721)

Recording: (761/ 10721)

<laugh> you were pastrating <laugh> yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (764/ 10721) 
no well i mean the money you know money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor 

Recording: (765/ 10721) 
well yeah i could of just took them out in the woods and whoop them but what is that going to prove 

Recording: (766/ 10721) 
it it does not have to cost anything but you you can go do it with your family or whatever so yeah 

Recording: (767/ 10721)

Recording: (774/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (775/ 10721) 
it is 

Recording: (776/ 10721) 
but that is what i 

Recording: (777/ 10721) 
and that is really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because i uh i have not said it yet but you know anyone who is listening to this tape you would be able to know i am a democrat and generally vote democratic although i will tell you i i did vote for group regular shock of once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he has not been bad for the city but um i am generally a democrat uh and i have only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early 

Recording: (778/ 10721) 
and uh what we do sometimes when we get into an area and we know that we had had a field out here we would be shooting to we would just on the target out there we pick a 

Recording: (779/ 10721) 
you you would not i know right off the bat i would not be able to make as much money as him maybe if i did this college thing i would back him out of the price range in man 

Recording: (780/ 10721) 
and this is the first time in my whole life that i have them in work and it just like my mom and i go out to lunch you know you can go to breakfast you mean because just so much you can do that well it is yeah what the difference took my mom and then amy and i went to lunch and then we you know and i actually i we moved about three months ago so i have been kind of doing a lot of stuff at our place so that is nice i mean had a i tend to get everything in the wallpaper i am painting and just do all those kinds of things but it is weird you know because i do not have to get up in the morning and i feel guilty you know he lived at six thirty or

well the uh both family and uh the mcdonald is have been around forever you know uh worth and indians industries and and the both families close to spatch uh and you got uh i think it is very dooh and everything and uh they can get to their ways through uh political orientous and everything but i think most of the money was uh was private money but they were given like tax 

Recording: (794/ 10721) 
had kids that have been like really top notch actors in the school plays it it is just not necessarily a school kind of thing and that they are going to be good at but i try to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently is no reason to think they will not be successful in life mark spitz one of them lintic gold metal he has a learning disability share bono can not remember a phone number without transf two

Recording: (828/ 10721) 
can not focus or can not attend anything but what is really happening is they attend to everything 

Recording: (829/ 10721) 
i wish i would these guys going to military school and so forth you know they have had problems before somewhere along the way whether it is academics or social are you ready to take on this additional responsibility no but we do not promote it again you are right we guess uh it percent of them are still we have academic for the the university oh you are going to be a sport athlete over then you have got come over here have got we have got different standard here and i am sure they do 

Recording: (830/ 10721)

Recording: (839/ 10721) 
yes for attention and uh yeah

um 

Recording: (948/ 10721) 
yeah a lot more 

Recording: (949/ 10721) 
you would think but i do not know there has to be something like why you know the first state that does it that does it i mean i after from one i am sure others would follow suit after they see the the benefits of it but that first one i do not know 

Recording: (950/ 10721) 
and he had the same thing happened to him that he has a scholarship row you can both of his knee are shot and everything but uh and he was a good bumper our one of the best ones that i ever seen and uh drive them like a large bird you know back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a nice car you know never let it get to it 

Recording: (951/ 10721) 
pleaders would meet with him once a week and then they come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do that enough for blacks he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say so just on my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see the greater applications of this oh no we need to having moved faster i said you know they would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal you have to take it step at a time whether you like it or not and what you are going to do is you are going to make it look like he is so bad on all these issues you are going to give people a 

Recording: (952/ 10721) 
um i would not know that long 

Recording: (953/ 10721) 
um uh images from star wars 

Recording: (954/ 10721) 
i do not know uh maybe it i think if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um that is more like i mean i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for that you know we have got like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff 

Recording: (955/ 10721) 
so i am not going to get any fairnessness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me their word saying that they decided they are favoring all that crap while you know fine uh but i am not going to i am not going to pay them till they contact me again 

Recording: (956/ 10721) 
or had no real relevantance to their lives i mean did you i think the kids would food valley immediately the issue right now is that there is nothing there 

Recording: (957/ 10721) 
and it stays with you for years <laugh> they do not realize that nobody tells them until after the 

Recording: (958/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (959/ 10721) 
that is it that is what i worry about the larger school systems too that is what concerns me with them is you get such a large variety of people compared to other like where i was in a smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it your parents knew their parents yeah your parents knew their parents their parents they they you know now you know and i walk to my friend is house and half her friend is if she is going over to play they got to drive them almost because they are they are all around so 

Recording: (960/ 10721) 
uh and she we really like her she is really we enjoy being with her but sometimes me more than being with my son uh 

Recording: (961/ 10721) 
i really enjoy one of the things i do not like about living in the big city is is like but i have gotten used to but i i do not like in fact that every time you look up in the nice the guy all that you see is this like orange haze <laugh> you can not see stars very well uh the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every three morning at two thirty in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it is 

Recording: (962/ 10721) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if their parents are unhappy together the only thing that is going to happen is it is going to trick down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more in their fight and then you feel like that your you know people feel it is my fault because this happened and you know and i think for yeah it was easier that they split up when i was younger than i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um 

Recording: (963/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (964/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (965/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (966/ 10721) 
well like a mile down to the south end or something like that but she just pushing your numbers always she just talked with numbers <laugh> 

Recording: (967/ 10721) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room to all to myself you know i do not want to go to some place where i would either have to we deal with something else so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i got home 

Recording: (968/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (969/ 10721) 
umhum i get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out which wrong with them because a lot of times it is a allergic reaction to the things they have eaten 

Recording: (970/ 10721) 
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (971/ 10721) 
it was during school um you would go there you would went there for two years you would junior and senior year and um like your junior go in the morning and you are seeing it go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cruise center then you go 

Recording: (972/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (973/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (974/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (975/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (976/ 10721) 
umhum the reds uh more so than indians back my younger days because they were not worth it then but 

Recording: (977/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (978/ 10721) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her actually her brother is a fellow history history major too and a friend of mine i do not know them all that well at least apparently her family i mean she is she is double major history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports are in this but they have made it 

Recording: (979/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (980/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (981/ 10721) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um i never i never did it and i you know i wish i could have waited so i was married but i you know you are going through that whatever you go see when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people some kids still do that but i think i guess i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (982/ 10721) 
oh i was gonna say it would be interesting 

Recording: (983/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (984/ 10721) 
it has to be a long standing kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than uh i i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh uh this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know i you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gave marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either oh he is um he is um you know they do not even wanna put it in the air they are gonna put it in the air they are gonna put it in the air they are gonna put it in the air 

Recording: (985/ 10721) 
you know crime is a lot worse now you know on the streets than it used to be 

Recording: (986/ 10721) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (987/ 10721) 
<laugh> yeah 

Recording: (988/ 10721) 
that is i mean we would be seventy years old when the kid graduated from high school uh and that would not be fair to the kid and and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so we talked about it decided it was not a good idea 

Recording: (989/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (990/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (991/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (992/ 10721) 
but you know you need to get it out of off your chance 

Recording: (993/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (994/ 10721) 
and this way it comes to die so 

Recording: (995/ 10721) 
i have to admit it when we go to try play golf sometimes and not having to eat time using it in 

Recording: (996/ 10721) 
they just can not think of out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffing up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (997/ 10721) 
because i have heard i have heard stories you know you can it that it people will pay them like that why <laugh> but but it is like yeah if you say it is true i can do it is that okay having them all have you will learn life better than them all from them whoever you they are getting their meal line was rather than i think so you you do not learn the line much perfectly but if you learn it someone who already does not speak your perfectly the you they 

Recording: (998/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (999/ 10721) 
oh because that goes with the disorder they know they know when who is button to push and when not to push the button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push you all the way that is the way teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (1000/ 10721) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people have are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they from the south or something like that so they and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely need people born and raising columbus so 

Recording: (1001/ 10721) 
yeah i did 

Recording: (1002/ 10721) 
yeah it was yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (1003/ 10721) 
yeah one more thing to deal with on the other hand it beats it is you know grown up in fifty foster homes or an offinage or 

Recording: (1004/ 10721) 
yeah that blocks out all that uh an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an anextralia stuff that is trying to pull you away 

Recording: (1005/ 10721) 
that a cat can i love to have her here for a couple three weeks have a or a month or something like that you know during the summer

Recording: (1011/ 10721) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (1012/ 10721) 
they am pretty involved they am pretty involved so a lot of these uh personalum what you get out of the church the community the community uh the church is designed as a community of other christians it is not necessarily this is really good um it is not designed as a congress station comes in and says we

Recording: (1201/ 10721) 
image you present that you have got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place you are going to be out of the loop and you know if if people are just a little more comfortable with themselves you know and i like i am a big one to talk i was like mister unstable for thirty years at least and then if i got the point and i went to the house and you know it is too much work you know you do not like me you do not if you do not go to somebody else and you know a lot of people are really worried and then you know i do not know if boys so much but i know girls are really worried about what people think of them and how they look and 

Recording: (1202/ 10721) 
and their needs were immediate 

Recording: (1203/ 10721) 
that fliped me out man i could not handle that that i am not ready for that i mean that was crazy she was twenty three the first person i have ever dated was older than me and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like dead serious she was hundred percent sure i was the person she was going to marry and also shewlett church every so often and she will come up and give me big hoagies like i miss you um like when i miss you too so not probably the way you miss me but i miss i miss you you know oh oh she is in lunon check you know <laugh> oh 

Recording: (1204/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1205/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1206/ 10721) 
oh no i like the story um 

Recording: (1207/ 10721) 
everyone everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to be going to be able to try that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (1208/ 10721) 
what was going on i mean you know the uh it was just a legend i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh uh eleven years old or something like that well they are accidental shooting and then him and uh uh another friend of mine from the same the same class you know uh he poured a gun shot him you know and did not know that the can not thing was lived at but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid 

Recording: (1209/ 10721) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is rest conditioning from childhood to childhood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is it is an a to even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (1210/ 10721) 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there is some really really acceptable things going on 

Recording: (1211/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1212/ 10721) 
this is there is there is no faulting in it this folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative or responsible to say that this experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and you had two individuals you said you are kidding and then and never mind a person they never send back 

Recording: (1213/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1214/ 10721) 
in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract that they would not be liable 

Recording: (1215/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (1216/ 10721) 
i would get more people asking me for that and the mean it turns out pretty nice to make end about ten or eleven bucks an hour 

Recording: (1217/ 10721) 
gun control i am not really too interested in i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they are one of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they are relatively safe so i mean 

Recording: (1218/ 10721) 
uh it is a pretty pretty it is it and uh you know enough around there to it is a it is a classic school up on the west side 

Recording: (1219/ 10721) 
yeah which cracks me up because if you have ever looked at the parents of models they are not necessarily all that attractive <laugh> yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (1220/ 10721) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go <laugh> 

Recording: (1221/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1222/ 10721) 
that is that is our job is to spoil them so the poor things out of like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground yep 

Recording: (1223/ 10721) 
you know talk to her but uh people do not when i was fourteen i did not care what anybody is home i was going to do it no matter what 

Recording: (1224/ 10721) 
i think so 

Recording: (1225/ 10721) 
oh yeah and you know i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook red meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stopsps it fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups lot of good soups for them with meat and it really does not allow me to cook it you know i am not going to sit home and make it roast every night 

Recording: (1226/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (1227/ 10721) 
he he is in the hard to 

Recording: (1228/ 10721) 
it is just the spirit the spiritual aspect there is around even onlstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematics of our time uh even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody is taking the time or made the time to challenge this area 

Recording: (1229/ 10721) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at a m well an airport has so many runways and so many tax you ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airport well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stay up there on hold while they are you know shooting them in what they do is that 

Recording: (1230/ 10721) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (1231/ 10721) 
yeah that part was no different i mean 

Recording: (1232/ 10721) 
sort of like the definition of need versus luxury uh there was definite change the definition of socialism democracy there is certainly have change over these times well the same thing or true be true with those it still functioning <laugh> excuse me uh um and i think we were also slowly swing our opinion on back to the and and to the family again 

Recording: (1233/ 10721) 
yeah and people do not 

Recording: (1234/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1235/ 10721) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (1236/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1237/ 10721) 
i started this school year off with uh twenty seven kindergartners and no aid 

Recording: (1238/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1239/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1240/ 10721) 
umhum it does 

Recording: (1241/ 10721) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not will think that you can say everything you know you have to everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (1242/ 10721) 
abent for the whole day which would be considered church so they said i what i had to do was go down to guvenile to this certain justity in junior high school and have him file churches so i took my son down to ham and he said it was a school she should have did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son is getting ready to go to the eleventh grade and 

Recording: (1243/ 10721) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my in fact i have been real happy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not liking for anything and they could afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to 

Recording: (1244/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1245/ 10721) 
that uh encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is a accident uh there is a flow of spirit in this world on things or moving at a pace that they are supposed to move that and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is 

Recording: (1246/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1247/ 10721) 
uh it is not really in office he is like a uh supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and then he gets to um talk with the the other contractor and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he he he just goes to the different site 

Recording: (1248/ 10721) 
you know mixed race or or handicapped or you know hard to place 

Recording: (1249/ 10721) 
or um 

Recording: (1250/ 10721) 
at each other is through for this that and the other and you know devisin is not my daughter is the one that i really get put in the middle of it you know and probably yeah it was a blessing that they moved to san jose because they probably could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth to court putting her on the wood and a stand for a stupid stuff you know so uh in the high side it was kind of a blessing that you knew there 

Recording: (1251/ 10721) 
and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (1252/ 10721) 
or uh like the art shows in worthenton or the crafts or even the the irish festival double and double and which can be free yeah in certain days and things like that uh the concerts on the river around the worthentown green really anything like that 

Recording: (1253/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1254/ 10721) 
in 

Recording: (1255/ 10721) 
oh gosh

they did not know 

Recording: (1257/ 10721)

Recording: (1258/ 10721) 
because i mean that is must be how she raises her kids you know and she is i am and that is what i asked her she is got a husband i am like so your husband you believe in sheets yeah i do not believe that i think that is terrible <laugh> 

Recording: (1259/ 10721) 
i would not doubt it i hope they vote against it but i do not think they will 

Recording: (1260/ 10721) 
so it is kind of it is kind of hard when you are looking at the the oil did you watch that debate 

Recording: (1261/ 10721) 
because it stopsbs your heart right away 

Recording: (1262/ 10721) 
they do not have that for clumbus schools 

Recording: (1263/ 10721) 
yeah they will just take one script and they will expand it um and and they will just run with that one script and then they are also churches that will just delete they will in in my in their minds they will believe certain sections of the script that they do not like first currently in chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spursing guess like healing people and and um 

Recording: (1264/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (1265/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 10721)

Recording: (1268/ 10721) 
boy that is a that is a really tough one i had not i had not thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touching about sexualident and and so likely you know so innoccure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has i had a different or in msdow i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (1269/ 10721) 
which you did not want to tell you 

Recording: (1270/ 10721)

Recording: (1271/ 10721) 
we have been land out there 

Recording: (1272/ 10721) 
they did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really i do not even understand the difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appears young and <laugh> and so did clint and so i think for the average voter that does have uh a lot of sway 

Recording: (1273/ 10721) 
bueers and the city of the 

Recording: (1274/ 10721) 
and your display might be different but it is it is basic information and i and we developed the system that people started doing that on sharing the data uh actually it started here i do not own issue campus and they will be independent 

Recording: (1275/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i guess so they mean there are people spend so many percent hours on computers doing this type of thing just going out there and see what they can find 

Recording: (1276/ 10721) 
i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (1277/ 10721) 
they have a little electric shock thing 

Recording: (1278/ 10721)

Recording: (1279/ 10721) 
well my husband is a allergic one we first got together but i have to meet um it is it is they well he he does that he has other allergies um so he gets shots and things but you know they always say it is the pet dandour 

Recording: (1280/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1281/ 10721) 
you know 

Recording: (1282/ 10721) 
um i would like to teach um the the field is particularly decorated right now so i am not holding out hope for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i couldoniaish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am a person is approaching things like whatever happens happens i am going to pursue my interest and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career 

Recording: (1283/ 10721) 
yeah i do not know that is so controversial i mean i mean to the point i mean they shell them out of put kind of money in us and public schools and it is like oh are you voting sex than it as you should do i 

Recording: (1284/ 10721) 
oh dear 

Recording: (1285/ 10721) 
oh i see 

Recording: (1286/ 10721) 
as of the mass people you got to find out and figure out what needs they are going to roll into like when they get older you know you get into the wheel chair companies or something so it is just going to be massive 

Recording: (1287/ 10721) 
so there was a couple people that went but probably two out of five hundred and nobody wanted to move <laugh> so i stayed here 

Recording: (1288/ 10721) 
but then uh it is like that some evil person back there in the screening room put some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that and if i was in church i would i would catch some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (1289/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1290/ 10721) 
umhum

Recording: (1292/ 10721) 
and one of them they talked down to columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well children you off have a high one of the highest dropout down to rates and school they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money so my my feeling is you know there is a lot of programs in school that sponsored by and federal government particularly uh to help the students are that are behind and they it is important 

Recording: (1293/ 10721) 
you know to get a a four or five dollar a year tax cut 

Recording: (1294/ 10721) 
nurge and feed and you know it it meets all of these needs it is kind of like it is just yeah umhum umhum umhum umhum oh i believe it umhum yeah well one of my l into league

Recording: (1427/ 10721) 
yeah well yeah it is just amazing when she went to the miles quite she said i do not even believe it half these that they could not get up off the floor or anything they were i have not trouble and she said there i was with my cup takes and money you know and she said they ought to buy a bottle of water we are very you know but she is like i said she just turned twenty eight she is so

Recording: (1431/ 10721) 
so you know and uh i was just brought up to being an honest person and um unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know so they sell out their ideas and their principals for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially it is used to so uh deals out uh i am not that kind of person that i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetary poor 

Recording: (1432/ 10721) 
we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over for a year so they were trying to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hard wear doing stall it and uh uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and ability overnight afraid things uh if there was any kind of uh special

Recording: (1436/ 10721) 
so they were really hypocritical 

Recording: (1437/ 10721) 
you know and that was and that worked out well but i think too like with my school schedule you know if i am just in class maybe you know three four days a week eat and then the rest of the time in the evening jay is not over there so it is not like i am relying on her every single day all the time to do that and i really would not want to put my child in day care

chopping you know but it is just become a really good metropolitan city i mean it is on its way 

Recording: (1480/ 10721) 
using the money for other using the money for other things and not realizing that they supposed to be putting that money back into business you know but i was running around this bunch of other people at basically we are doing the same thing you know so 

Recording: (1481/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (1482/ 10721) 
i you know maybe i am oblivious to things but i mean i mean it seems like there is a lot of worst places 

Recording: (1483/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (1484/ 10721) 
because that that is happened where he is like i will not do it again and and he did again i feel like once it sheater always sheater to me you know maybe maybe see an ex woman you will not do that to but he is gotten away with it sometimes with me i feel like he would not really do it you know 

Recording: (1485/ 10721) 
we are harassmenting at individual because you are harassmenting our waiting for him to commit this problem and i let us just get one away from that example you can talk about whether you you were carrying uh no i do not want to get into the guns and knives and stuff and school was not up 

Recording: (1486/ 10721) 
uh oh okay well you know the shot is 

Recording: (1487/ 10721) 
not really a national system it is already been put to national if they rate them state to state and city to city but on on the level of the actual needs of the student you know you can not just put down you know a book and say i want you to put five hundred words on this page why you like this or just like this book i mean one person can do it and another one i mean 

Recording: (1488/ 10721) 
yeah they do um i think something like sixty percent

Recording: (1493/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1494/ 10721) 
that would be fine but again i do not it is just another person with a different life style it is like they are they are they are just seam as me it is just

Recording: (1610/ 10721) 
as a teacher how would you in how could you cut down the student to say no that is not the way it was and this this is you are looking from the teacher is guide no but how do you know about asking the person but it is a matter of tradition handing it down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way in that way and it is it is not say written down by this past of all of those days probably written down or not written down by a verbal and extended and so it is that hand 

Recording: (1611/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (1612/ 10721) 
the milk okay so it

Recording: (1622/ 10721) 
by saying that uh cole had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for a chiefly voted for a raise for the the police officers it is just that you know the police he is was tied to his and i do not like people who try to manipulateate facts uh and and that was manipulating the fact that they did not like that she was um uh uh uh against the the the tiff uh impleerous once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with 

Recording: (1623/ 10721) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if they were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns ines in school

ah okay okay it is probably growing up and i do not i have been there done that too but still you have to you have to um notice respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then and they saw the interaction with the other people the school he went to there is a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers oh 

Recording: (1630/ 10721) 
so it is a good money maker 

Recording: (1631/ 10721)

or she she um she does not know about all of them you know like again she found out about the eighty eight just like we all you know i guess like a couple of the kids in the class had had it or on it you know and she was like oh was that and she was like oh i have to figure out that stuff you know she called uh one of the his work is in fit out the whole program and she coming and telling another girl about it and she told me about it 

Recording: (1642/ 10721) 
of uh all the off campus kids to like to the police and so they they start driving around around ten thirty trying to bus them for noise on the weekends so it is pretty active 

Recording: (1643/ 10721) 
and i would definitely keep an eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (1644/ 10721) 
they have different art classes and different speech and uh language classes different levels of science and it is kind of like a college bidge campus 

Recording: (1645/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (1646/ 10721) 
you probably see better uh not that though <laugh> not that one but yeah it is just certain things make person themselves 

Recording: (1647/ 10721) 
you have a name now 

Recording: (1648/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1649/ 10721)

yeah i if if uh there there can not be sanctions for doing the right thing yeah and um uh so i would be i am opposed to that i well yeah i i guess you would have to say that i would i would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything uh in in in that relation that it is just that the effort should focus on on getting them 

Recording: (1652/ 10721) 
yeah i take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it is i do not i meant see twenty nine hours of it

Recording: (1655/ 10721) 
yeah he went to columbus public schools well you know i i am catholic and i went to catholic schools and so i tried that with those my kids bund schools and uh for a couple of years and so he was in uh catholic school a couple of years they got he got expelled because he is uh eight the hd 

Recording: (1656/ 10721) 
umhum sure 

Recording: (1657/ 10721) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (1658/ 10721) 
just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher in that he have learned a lot um and i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so we were always in everything trying to get good teachers and then you know it is always have to do with money and then not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are over work in all these big large classroom it just seems to me when 

Recording: (1659/ 10721) 
um he is a business man 

Recording: (1660/ 10721) 
yeah it it says 

Recording: (1661/ 10721) 
that was real close to my home <laugh> 

Recording: (1662/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (1663/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (1664/ 10721) 
i have got a son and then he is got a son so i guess i am a grandfather i hardly ever see him 

Recording: (1665/ 10721) 
okay well that is a good job i mean because you get flex time yeah it was 

Recording: (1666/ 10721) 
i i will that is a that is a tough one uh i liked that but they were like to borrow their boys and stuff you know or those put them in the still of the hall the fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake you know uh and i never really thought about while i was growing up as it was what was around when everything uh always knew that by i gar again you know by my dad being home 

Recording: (1667/ 10721) 
the way he he went in for less than a year i think and then he was it is hard and then he was called back in and send to vietnam and it was uh sort of a traumatic experience for him that i think he is pretty well come out of the but he was in a rear area he never was up where he was doing any shooting himself but oh he is um he is um he is um he is um you know they are not very good but they are uh they are um good 

Recording: (1668/ 10721) 
i do not know what kind that is because i know they they have traded airplanes since i have been gone 

Recording: (1669/ 10721) 
bizard job 

Recording: (1670/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (1671/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1672/ 10721) 
um i think they might have tried it somehow but obviously they would not have been as uh good at it or you know what i am trying to say it would not have been as much restriction because obviously and the bonds is something but to actually to have that right there i mean have the access and what not i mean i guess the grandparents had the house on broke them they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew how to use them and that scares me 

Recording: (1673/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1674/ 10721) 
these loose sense that they keep having i suspect they probably will not do that they will um leave things open and did for fster tv movies or maybe another uh future length movie uh 

Recording: (1675/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1676/ 10721) 
i know uh 

Recording: (1677/ 10721)

Recording: (1678/ 10721) 
i said there is a big 

Recording: (1679/ 10721) 
and i give it on hope or something like that i am just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh you know there is just uh um it is very limited out there you know and and your education is is an asset but like i said even as a person uh now going through br uh i am discriminating it against my opinion because i have a bachelor is in other words uh bureau occasional rehabilitation 

Recording: (1680/ 10721) 
oh yeah i am oh i always wear tshirts i do not i am a tshirt person i do not like things on my arms like they got only like poor lids or anything 

Recording: (1681/ 10721) 
the part now it takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching 

Recording: (1682/ 10721) 
um yes i have not they talked about that here actually have they talked about 

Recording: (1683/ 10721) 
i am hoping that will be the same experience as it is in the high state 

Recording: (1684/ 10721) 
and i think at some times they do not even count all the voted i mean sometimes they really want it to go do bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen and somehow or they will they will count it so dead or they will you know 

Recording: (1685/ 10721) 
like that like salt area but like on the limited south area that does not seem right either but 

Recording: (1686/ 10721) 
i tried calling them up picking them up doing a volunteer thing and i would get calls all during the night go pick these kids up because i thought they are doing something to help but you know you know and helping them 

Recording: (1687/ 10721)

Recording: (1708/ 10721) 
that is my dad has right here a blue eye so 

Recording: (1709/ 10721) 
yeah you even got these oh stunk guns they are the ones that scare me

Recording: (1711/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1712/ 10721) 
and basically they were three weeks long and they were about four and a half hours the first one was really long you know james man you know could not take to the <laugh> last night was not so bad so i mean the person was a lot of lot of information classroom kind of stuff but he knew well he was much i he is just so sweet he is just wonderful he was much more interactive then then a lot of the other guys were just kind of you know they would sit there and they were not breathing and they were kind of rolling their eyes and they just would be cutty bunch above to you know it is going to come down to it 

Recording: (1713/ 10721) 
oh well they knew all all different things i mean i mean culturally you know with different different music it was it course i am i am in a suburban high school and since that you did not get exposed to much uh so that that was the the biggest thing well of course they talk funny in the east but um that you know other than that in the culture shock um it was not it was not that different 

Recording: (1714/ 10721) 
right if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i i think almost anybody can be poor right now but you know in in election and times of the weekend is a couple of centuries uh a year is an eon you know so anything could happen between now and then but i think a door had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate will go with the moderate candidate uh which is basically where clinton placed 

Recording: (1715/ 10721) 
because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the height of oregon uh years but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not no but it is not a minds that i have so it is hard for me to understand

Recording: (1721/ 10721) 
right the same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older pokes right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else is having their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible to be situationations got that way but i do believe that the older people including our government people and everybody that is at the top has to set the example 

Recording: (1722/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1723/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (1724/ 10721)

Recording: (1736/ 10721) 
um um 

Recording: (1737/ 10721) 
yeah i think the population uh in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area uh i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know more aware of what going on and i really am going to be some kind of red for uh i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things

Recording: (1991/ 10721)

Recording: (2000/ 10721) 
and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just you know because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well b you know at face about it 

Recording: (2001/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2002/ 10721)

Recording: (2080/ 10721) 
well i think that my opinion is that if you can go to school and you are not going you know at work and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know you know a lot of kids that is all they really want to do nowadays is just cause an aggravation opinion 

Recording: (2081/ 10721)

because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and in a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just dependingity or what not just in a split second you know we we might have that once in life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go oh you know

yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people um bitch in complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political inconsulting for the ohio education association i used to go around and try to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important and john kennedy won umhum

you know so 

Recording: (2222/ 10721)

Recording: (2223/ 10721) 
i i do not think that it it goes into like valleys i do not associate like rising crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i mean if there is a correlation i mean uh i am i am more of the you know like parents have a greater influence on the children than tv ever could i mean i watch a lot of tv but i feel that my parents taught 

Recording: (2224/ 10721) 
i remember mcgee lane i do not know if you know who they are yeah 

Recording: (2225/ 10721) 
so there was a big fuss about that and two years later they came out with another study that says well they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuild them and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like by if you are going to shut us school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (2226/ 10721) 
do you 

Recording: (2227/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2228/ 10721)

Recording: (2229/ 10721) 
yeah i like to go up there and play pool once in a while 

Recording: (2230/ 10721) 
so that is a huge amount of the money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra ah so sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh but once in a while i will get wind players play in it also and uh sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something 

Recording: (2231/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i do not see you figure that out i think it is on i think it is on fix 

Recording: (2232/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (2233/ 10721) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourselves it is they were others and i think as you as we become older you start thinking about how uh much your witnesses are but really your witnesses are the strength you pull from your faith it is not not the o toalistic things that the university here uh professors to be the thing 

Recording: (2234/ 10721) 
oh yeah um yes and no they are kind of  weird like that um once that of grandparents who are they can not hear whoever says anything there is it said on the other side that they are a little bit more racist uh but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up 

Recording: (2235/ 10721) 
in the family he came from a buffalo new our working class he left he never looked back either and so it is kind of like you know our both people i say say you know how we are it i i do not know we go the schools are always so grateful to us because we organize the state check tournaments he started a baseball league for the spelling you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids 

Recording: (2236/ 10721)

Recording: (2257/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2258/ 10721) 
all i remember is them talking about condom is i do not think they talked about anything besides that but um then again i could be in the wrong uh but yes that i mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have 

Recording: (2259/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2260/ 10721) 
uh how do you picture it

i 

Recording: (2263/ 10721) 
before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something done with it now you can not get backing on it 

Recording: (2264/ 10721) 
<laugh> yes that is our 

Recording: (2265/ 10721)

Recording: (2274/ 10721) 
umhum all right 

Recording: (2275/ 10721) 
uh they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimately injured in their lives have been affected that they do not deserve money from one ever is not uh and it i do not think it is fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it has not happened to um i do not think that is fair uh because it does affect your entire lawn has otherwise i would be full time employed 

Recording: (2276/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (2277/ 10721) 
uh it is a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot in there how hot who knows but it is been such a strengthening sparing thing it also physically purifies your by so much sweat that pours out of your body become or that heat uh it gets all the crap out of you

you know 

Recording: (2279/ 10721)

Recording: (2281/ 10721) 
because see this is a great area around here to live and people you know like in clintonville realize that and then when you get a little more over around i uh my daughter was on war fight you know and i wanted to buy a house over there but i was single

the efficiency see tests that they are now requiring you can not graduate from an ohio high school with a with a diploma unless you pass all the efficiency tests and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time in the eighth the end of the eighth grade then you get two tries in the ninth grade two tries in the tenth 

Recording: (2283/ 10721) 
you know they can do it over they want 

Recording: (2284/ 10721) 
boy like action oh bite the bad guys yeah and now it is uh you know like looking and um sort of postulatingating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a medical for it for things in real life uh and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child in a ponder culture i think it is kind of interesting 

Recording: (2285/ 10721) 
and i do not know that is quite that bad <laugh> but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are not i have proved up and i am not real up on that 

Recording: (2286/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (2287/ 10721) 
and there was one where they were going along and there is a little uh spanish you look and dog about so only about that i kind of fall on long after though i am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for to forthall worse off than i am

Recording: (2293/ 10721) 
just changing the language 

Recording: (2294/ 10721) 
and it is probably not as you know like you know as a convince of the fact that like the mister is there is because he is a you know you are straight as a little out of the way yet so you know you know spend some time to get there you like you like you would florida california and so it is like if you want to get to the beach you do not want to say oh like memorial day it is like forget it you know just forget it it is like but that is right at least you do not have to worry about it you know fighting it to her is

you can not isolate yourself from them it is like americans americans do not have a have a have a strong hold on it <laugh> 

Recording: (2303/ 10721) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over here that that that is okay that or the person does it to you i mean there my mother used to say for every law that was written there is another law written over here that will actually is gonna actually nolify that and i and actually as i growing older i found it in it is worse than today is world as i said as the silver rights moving and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it

yeah yeah 

Recording: (2308/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2309/ 10721) 
course with ours if you hit you did not have to hit them direct you hit them right by slipping over 

Recording: (2310/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2311/ 10721) 
yeah this was three years ago about three years ago in august they will be three and yeah i was however many was that in eighty nine or ninety or something like that well it is it gets more and more um like uh it is not like america but more and more like a regular democracy gee every year i mean not really but closer and closer <laugh> a little bit

yeah 

Recording: (2313/ 10721) 
um i prefer i have done it by myself but i prefer to do it with my husband and stuff 

Recording: (2314/ 10721) 
it is story elements 

Recording: (2315/ 10721)

Recording: (2316/ 10721) 
well it is good now uh while the webably it is changed that there is computers have made a big difference uh it is more exciting now for people who can at a uh uh they were interested in it is more emphasis on information not books and things that go into the library to get any information

Recording: (2318/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2319/ 10721) 
right uh under the u s a today syndrome 

Recording: (2320/ 10721)

Recording: (2321/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2322/ 10721) 
you know her and her being at him what what is the what we are going to be looking for right now that i belong uh

right 

Recording: (2332/ 10721) 
right <laugh> 

Recording: (2333/ 10721)

Recording: (2368/ 10721)

Recording: (2369/ 10721)

Recording: (2416/ 10721) 
i was not born here but i was raised here 

Recording: (2417/ 10721) 
i am finishing high school um actually heard about a program where you can finish college on the 

Recording: (2418/ 10721)

Recording: (2424/ 10721) 
neat 

Recording: (2425/ 10721) 
i think for the most part people can handle it uh obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that have the bigger problem with that the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movement and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like like more of the generations today or whatever like basically anyone down to the age of about forty or fifty so i think that they could they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it 

Recording: (2426/ 10721) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (2427/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2428/ 10721)

Recording: (2431/ 10721) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (2432/ 10721) 
yeah um and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very uh conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed in the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working at the free answer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (2433/ 10721) 
you know a a check magnit

Recording: (2439/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2440/ 10721)

yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come a i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not going to condem them uh at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out than maybe that child um is having a problem and then sending them to counseling of some sort 

Recording: (2450/ 10721) 
and and she is very determined uh she has said that having this being pregnant and having this baby is made her focus on things a lot differently she does not she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking

Recording: (2456/ 10721) 
i am not real up on everything that is been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused in and you would be able to say you know this is what there is these three things that i think are really important and then i am really going to work to make sure that they get taking care of and and i do not i just think people kind of body die and say well this is it is like that you know oh well see what we can kind of do about it and then i am gonna you know 

Recording: (2457/ 10721) 
everything and i come back and you know where my parents live they were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know just like giant anyhow i mean it just was so overwhelming theming even though obviously i would grown up with you know i come my whole life and you know not that i sort of china is completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to east and then i

yeah they will not buy their 

Recording: (2540/ 10721) 
yeah it is been month out every year 

Recording: (2541/ 10721) 
so that like it is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (2542/ 10721) 
you know any schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a south people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know in checking everything and 

Recording: (2543/ 10721) 
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that had beenbeen kept up 

Recording: (2544/ 10721) 
uh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (2545/ 10721)

Recording: (2547/ 10721) 
definitely so my daughter definitely because she was working for camp scouts able christ and she came home one weekend from uh xtford and uh 

Recording: (2548/ 10721) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged in them but i decided to 

Recording: (2549/ 10721) 
it is been it it is been remarkablyably well i mean i have it had any problem i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and and i had a check up and my doctor really thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an allter sound well the thing is they did this allter sound they did not find anything so which was really kind of creep because they did not know there is that whole two little pregnant thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did them my interest home was not my regular doctor and he is kind of well he he he does a little 

Recording: (2550/ 10721) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh not so much uh the type of work that i do but i think she is very cheroable very begetting very uh 

Recording: (2551/ 10721) 
yeah i mean i can not say that they would be any difference with them 

Recording: (2552/ 10721) 
convicted white men of uh killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (2553/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2554/ 10721) 
because i have seen things that are not physically possible 

Recording: (2555/ 10721) 
bassacoustics really 

Recording: (2556/ 10721) 
well yeah we got broken into uh i think twice and stuff got stolen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into and gas life and pretty much everybody around there is been uh criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (2557/ 10721) 
so the money is just kind of wasted 

Recording: (2558/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (2559/ 10721) 
well when i was growing up there was not that much violence and i could go and in and i have done it now my name in on this report so you can not do nothing about 

Recording: (2560/ 10721) 
but they do not use some brothers i mean they just go through it they just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket you know because it is not a hard rain and the first year i was there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there is no cold real cold winter and uh and then from july august sevador october just gorgeous just so gorgeous but i like i like that fall getting that missed and 

Recording: (2561/ 10721) 
the real um slap in the face for him so he was really mean after that so i laughed i just i walked out and picked the kids up with the bus to off and they were like oh what do you know i said we are going somewhere are you because it is getting the car so but um yeah just a couple of experiences like that they will make you do other things so you know i stayed tough when i you know got other jobs and 

Recording: (2562/ 10721) 
but it is mind boggling that is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking to whole high schools two football teams you know it is just mind boggling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a half a half of people and do not know anybody else you know a lot more of uh tightening group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (2563/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2564/ 10721) 
i that certainly possible there are lots of ways that my friend does it work <laugh> in ways that other people do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with been comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real a lot more temporary we always joke you though that that predictableible and some of those things are not uh even temperate or not things you would use of just grab me you know but but but but 

Recording: (2565/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2566/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2567/ 10721) 
very different uh just been a lot of invasions 

Recording: (2568/ 10721) 
um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever uh just because obviously they you would basically men make your parents as far as what you do when you are young and things like that and obviously if you still had to male parents or whatever you might be thinking <laugh> more towards like dating guys and things like that um i 

Recording: (2569/ 10721) 
i do not know if it is where it is but i definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments in the channel 

Recording: (2570/ 10721) 
her her little boyfriend who was the the captain kirk commander reagan like stud person uh i see in many ways uh i mean i agree in dsp doing a big deep space in my van so i do not dislike voyager i just do not like it to the same degree um in dsp and i in the head major cure uh who was a sold just are in the revolutionousian area and if i in many ways she like completely broke out of traditional it goes i also like 

Recording: (2571/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2572/ 10721) 
you know because you you are learning more about yourself and uh you are you are also learning more about like you are experiencing a lot of freedoms that you did not have obviously you know you are  driving 

Recording: (2573/ 10721) 
i had three uh they are all grown up maybe kids as own i have grandchildren from that age <laugh> 

Recording: (2574/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (2575/ 10721) 
right right 

Recording: (2576/ 10721) 
but they should do is just tell people if their kids do not get to go to school i bet the attitude changes pretty fast <laugh> 

Recording: (2577/ 10721) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot me and i am going to be shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they i know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money and did not have any food they when it kills so many animals and gave it to them they do not have a problem with that uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charles h withst in tells it 

Recording: (2578/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2579/ 10721) 
uhhuh uhhuh well and you know that song by itself probably if i just heard it once or twice i said okay yeah and she is an interesting character here i guess i mean i do not know everything about her but i i remember that she insulted the <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (2580/ 10721) 
<laugh> and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because after i am speaking up and they want to do things with mine so they are not bing cravie or was it no um 

Recording: (2581/ 10721) 
and the is doing expression of the expression on that phase can be equally effective as the smack of on the bottom uh with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know the money the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and you know it 

Recording: (2582/ 10721) 
even if my kids are not there they will stop by my house just to say hi 

Recording: (2583/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (2586/ 10721)

Recording: (2587/ 10721) 
yeah right <laugh> 

Recording: (2588/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (2589/ 10721) 
because it is more open uh and you couch it in terms of civil rights uh my boyfriend is thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against and he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent in the way to do that as through you know talk into them religion wise um i do not think it is the same i think it um your sexuality is gene c based

yeah 

Recording: (2591/ 10721) 
than i 

Recording: (2592/ 10721) 
he has to but that the more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is been because of the loss of up parent their children so yes do those things do again and they always have some but that is a very small percentage that has got 

Recording: (2593/ 10721)

Recording: (2596/ 10721) 
and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (2597/ 10721) 
it is a nice thing well differently i think as you talk as you would be talking it is gonna be talking to some older people i am saying people in the in the eighties that by our how the progress of life it is and how you think because when you go to a state sales all you are talking about is the problemotives that sit on the ones the quality of life is in the mind the person you are you you avoid it all the time 

Recording: (2598/ 10721) 
yeah but just had to have something to go by this as opposed to say you know we have others go with it you know i mean you can not go back and try to raise i do not know if sometimes somebody was trying to rearr a calendar one time were not they 

Recording: (2599/ 10721)

Recording: (2604/ 10721) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe and oh i think it was a high school in marion we have built on um in old weapons depot and so like leukemiaism and so like that is their main campaign now is going to form the public and trying uh get that changed they have also done other things uh other they they do anythings doing the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (2605/ 10721) 
that once you have built through it through something it looks different but previous to it yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you have never listened to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i would like okay i will go to europe

Recording: (2710/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (2711/ 10721) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um colling data 

Recording: (2712/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2713/ 10721)

Recording: (2720/ 10721) 
i guess that happened just here in town a couple of them a week ago or something like that you know or a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just sensless crimes really uh and who is really is a fault and who is really they are he is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh been not state ever would have been a one of the two that you that could long buy and you know if they would have they sort of wound up like

Recording: (2723/ 10721) 
medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take the medicine every day just so i get is mind take mine every day and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility onsusbility which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is uh there is uh some law that  six people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case 

Recording: (2724/ 10721)

Recording: (2729/ 10721) 
being cut um i think the fact that things like at responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know think as far as people getting paid and then and then this person goes off and and we have then you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and

umhum yeah yeah 

Recording: (2792/ 10721) 
a wide window to thousand at all costs stick with ninety eight much better much better operating system

Recording: (2794/ 10721) 
yeah i have been thoroughly spoiled you know they catch a dish so it is those are good 

Recording: (2795/ 10721)

Recording: (2796/ 10721) 
well i do not think they should be responsible but i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties you know the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they 

Recording: (2797/ 10721)

yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (3093/ 10721) 
well i i starts with with allowing uh here there are two mommy is 

Recording: (3094/ 10721)

Recording: (3096/ 10721) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and just like to have that relationship and so i i think that even if i were working you know as my oldest daughter i worked by range my life around her so that even i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with with her all day now when she started school i switched over to lunches um

Recording: (3098/ 10721) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to them because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one and you go uh you know there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back go and you you need me left or right there and i go he yes it is a direct turn left you know you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kind of goes a long way and the pilots the same way they most often 

Recording: (3099/ 10721) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (3100/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (3106/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3107/ 10721) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want some you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about so you know i am am everybody to prevent them from going to the same idea i want some companies doing what research they that is a that is a right on the web too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you 

Recording: (3108/ 10721) 
<laugh>

Recording: (3116/ 10721) 
um i am a lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3117/ 10721) 
well my son started yeah son started in public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social however say he is the one that talks too much <laugh> it is a teacher say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you getting near a bunch of other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play 

Recording: (3118/ 10721) 
this it it is in a t shape and the the side of the building all the sounds is rolls right up the wall and this trash truck made so much stinking noise it is ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i did not i i developed uh i developed the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that is that is uh one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because because there is no noise there 

Recording: (3119/ 10721)

Recording: (3120/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3121/ 10721) 
yeah see they adjusted that but then they did not have anyway to um enforce that so 

Recording: (3122/ 10721) 
hopefully 

Recording: (3123/ 10721) 
and and it is just 

Recording: (3124/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (3125/ 10721) 
reason to vote against them then if any big issue comes up that is just going to be added to everything else and what you need to do is after you have this meeting with them is come out in to raise him in that he is doing a good job and that we are moving along steadily uh and i you know i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means um i made that mistake when i was president of the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy pass so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all 

Recording: (3126/ 10721) 
no <laugh> actually i was uh going to get my ged after that

not the neighborhood thing as much and you can not let them run around as much as we did it and we you know we rode our bikes everywhere we rode to the pool we rode down to the tour and now your scares let them right around town because you afraid they are knock on the comeback you know so yeah it so many different things oh my one bad it was 

Recording: (3131/ 10721) 
we are still working those problems out yeah 

Recording: (3132/ 10721) 
right <laugh> 

Recording: (3133/ 10721) 
right it is just like like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like in i especially in lessen still like really influence like how you are as a person and like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subject you are going to hate that subject you know and like if you have good teachers i love it i mean it really influences too like how like what you want to do with your life and and people is do not really have knowledge that too much 

Recording: (3134/ 10721) 
or take me to court again you know they got the money i do not

well yeah and yeah my and my my daughter my daughter is the opposite uh but he would do that and so he was not he was very he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble and it is like i i do not know we would be told he was a problem but he did not understand what was going on and they were not that was not structured he would go to school every day and not know what to expect because i was not like this will do this and then 

Recording: (3205/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3206/ 10721) 
that is funny they start showing close i guess so they can lock in <laugh> you mean when this is it when this is it you head i would order <laugh> come across the oh it 

Recording: (3207/ 10721) 
swe had to go back to the hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was and this was not unusual it was a horrible period in a i think what i mean my wife and i do agree so it is he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (3208/ 10721) 
oh no no no i mean she is a she is a great person she is a good christian but there is some things about her that i would not want in my life <laugh> it bakes now on that but uh i have been single since uh probably march and i am probably going to stay that way for a while mainly because i do not like anybody nobody likes me i i get that way i do not 

Recording: (3209/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3210/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3211/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (3212/ 10721) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because they because of the drug and alcohol they will not put them on some of the medication so but as far as i can oh he is been pretty clear and clean on that and uh you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to psychology and uh uh we have been paying for it but we do not have a problem with that because he is going <laugh> he likes the 

Recording: (3213/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3214/ 10721) 
oh yeah i have no idea <laugh> 

Recording: (3215/ 10721) 
like that war divided people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting robvers is weight and not and in protecting choice you know um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign or i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to a point two to three supreme court justices and if that if you want to protect that right you have got to 

Recording: (3216/ 10721) 
and it is like i i like how check i thought about going to anyork but it it was really expensive and like um i do not know but just because it is that and and schools more of uh nonsraditional uh type where they give you like evaluation and you do not get grades like and so so then it let that is what that is what i heard is they get in there of where the professor rates uh like a couple of page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that i mean that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved and noticing what 

Recording: (3217/ 10721) 
umhum yeah yeah 

Recording: (3218/ 10721) 
northland mall 

Recording: (3219/ 10721) 
because they kick me out for some dumb reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking a blame 

Recording: (3220/ 10721) 
part of the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one instead america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just 

Recording: (3221/ 10721) 
no not at all i would have rather vote him from a can but over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which i am not saying he is wrong because the kennedys were very big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like he everything is been handed to him in the nice and uh the issue of like whether did drugs and that is that is a big issue but i do not like the way he interested you know that to me just if he did drugs okay everyone 

Recording: (3222/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3223/ 10721) 
so i started watching him got and i do not want to say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the uh i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective uh so it was not like my first couple of year years of college from sort of the second half of high school to the first couple of years of college i just sort of 

Recording: (3224/ 10721) 
he has different levels of things that people need at different age and things like that and you know and and at forty you you think wow you know and you really need to make a difference or do something and and i can see that because i have gone through all the phase that he is talking about so 

Recording: (3225/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3226/ 10721) 
she will be nineteen september 

Recording: (3227/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3228/ 10721) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going to have a a great time with their kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize that but like this it is worth it 

Recording: (3229/ 10721) 
um actually i guess it is something that is always sort of been there have always been real big on just building things i mean been real big hands on and last summer i helped my dad uh put a garage under his house um make him mean literally i mean we have poured the foundation and everything i i mean it turned out really well and i mean it is really fun to do i mean it is i like it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time 

Recording: (3230/ 10721) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (3231/ 10721) 
it 

Recording: (3232/ 10721) 
uh like uh say going to over here they will you have to call for released times to these different airport and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like it twenty seven passes they are so he they know by looking at the entire picture of how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is air mine is that causes it to himself it is like uh you know like you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room uh ten oclock today well rather than say 

Recording: (3233/ 10721) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like to design um i mean a designers but you know like i went to uh uh i was in police uh uh law enforcement 

Recording: (3234/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3235/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3236/ 10721) 
uh so there is always something going wrong with the wiring or the plumbing or the something and uh it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house that  older house but no i do not know not anymore <laugh> 

Recording: (3237/ 10721) 
you know he says it eagles mc square and i say it is eagles mcc ubed because the world is three dimension it is not too dimension uh two the dimension limits and everything but you look at history of relatively relatively all of our mathematicalinical they have been based on that 

Recording: (3238/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (3239/ 10721) 
play and like like just things that are different and like my sociology and psychology teacher who who he he was the same guy taught history and he was real good too like it was really usy obviously but like it is just like interesting um like the sociology of high school and they coming to sociology class about it you know just uh 

Recording: (3240/ 10721) 
like on the fair they regular basis even 

Recording: (3241/ 10721) 
right right it probably went out of business when he left 

Recording: (3242/ 10721) 
it was it was especially it was my job but you know the parents always get stuck 

Recording: (3243/ 10721) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like <laugh> 

Recording: (3244/ 10721) 
um i guess that would be a slightly different part of them then not really sure how big a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she in of course they will go into public school the next year 

Recording: (3245/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3246/ 10721)

Recording: (3254/ 10721) 
and socially too i mean mostly eighty eight d and ld kids are emotionally immature as well so like the songs that their friends are listening to and our friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they are still i feel like a fifth grader you know they are not interested in girls and they are still listening to music that younger kids would like they are just generally socially they mature a little slower takes them longer to catch up 

Recording: (3255/ 10721) 
uhhuh in the watch those yeah you kind of like you know look it up and says you know it does not even you know got their sites on me yeah because that is uh so you know that is like the world war two stuff you know there is like the remains i am sure it is like we get to see the wall it is like they are i mean i am sure they just like this there it from what from what i understand it was like 

Recording: (3256/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3257/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (3258/ 10721) 
yeah yeah yeah i should not have to do this i am not responsible for the her happyness of the family 

Recording: (3259/ 10721) 
and they used to have the laser light show downtown they they do not have anymore uh you know just even if you do one thing for your mind 

Recording: (3260/ 10721) 
uh i have i uh you know there are kids in the neighborhood and uh the grown up stock and i talk to the kids too i there is a a girl lives next door right we talk a lot she just started at um everett the uh arts middle school 

Recording: (3261/ 10721) 
no i would not 

Recording: (3262/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3263/ 10721) 
well i mean most of it was me going over it with them and just you know i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and you know just doing the things that worked for him as an individual 

Recording: (3264/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3265/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3266/ 10721) 
yeah and then when it did the blood test they found out a a carber tension plus cardiovascular disease and on due to drugs 

Recording: (3267/ 10721) 
there is so much negativeity on the national news i do not know if they will just be funded in or if people will associate that was called this 

Recording: (3268/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3269/ 10721) 
but like if you said i drive a bus service will go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them like it does not even have to be hot you know i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you run three shifts you can just you know here is a box of dough or something you know and that does not cost the company that much can 

Recording: (3270/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3271/ 10721) 
or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and in the dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university in the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that 

Recording: (3272/ 10721) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are gonna have a lot of people who or you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends but they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were yeah 

Recording: (3273/ 10721) 
oh really that is awesome 

Recording: (3274/ 10721) 
it is it is kind of a fun game it is just strange because uh like we are on i came down in semester so there is still months where everyone was down here and now there is like nobody down here here so it is myself my two roommates and maybe a handful of like other people that mean now so it like the social aspect like has is limitedished a lot but that still i mean for fun we uh play a lot of video games too like i guess we would think like the natural i mean things you would expect from a college guy

i saw a lot of stuff like that and met a lot of 

Recording: (3291/ 10721) 
i 

Recording: (3292/ 10721) 
i think one of the thing is that we when when you are backtides that you are really supposed to help other people to the like if if somebody gives you a gift you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like old of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think oh what are those weird oves you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we have we have wear makeup

Recording: (3328/ 10721) 
that is a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out and my opinion when that stuff happens when i she well i see someone light the horns of a bul on fire and spaying interment the bowl and then all of a sudden the bowl gets the flame put out and the bowl runs gord through the person is leg and throws them around and kills them right near death i do not have any sympathy for them 

Recording: (3329/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3330/ 10721) 
is not 

Recording: (3331/ 10721) 
and then how they would execute them as is now 

Recording: (3332/ 10721) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i mean uh i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizens chip in the in the english and maybe the science because i like science when i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass them math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know add subtractable 

Recording: (3333/ 10721) 
which made it a little inconvenient when he lived in the uh the twin tower in the dorm because if i needed him to come home or something you know the oh i do not know i got to get it get to my car some kind of way you know

Recording: (3339/ 10721) 
yeah i thought that was interesting uh so it it is a values you know the the christian values thing uh i do not have problem with we had a little problem i am just like my son had to learn the hill mary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us uh right it down for us because we did not know and they run it down run so he learned it wrong and he had a money and we and we did not tell you know a little things like that but it was not a problem uh there was a problem for with our son for a while because 

Recording: (3340/ 10721) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (3341/ 10721) 
when i started dating it almost seventeen um so now i think i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are um um i i personally do not think a school can do it 

Recording: (3342/ 10721) 
do whatever i want to some degree 

Recording: (3343/ 10721) 
i said this will never work i am not interested to take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with it just work with it so i end up giving him for a higher forty four but it was just funny because i thought i thought they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (3344/ 10721) 
and that is what i am saying it toning for thin quite a bureaucracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgive this one what they would did i mean in the church inf came up where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door the church as a picture of christian for climas with a missionaryary a pleased and all his men with his sore drawn a dead native american in his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now

Recording: (3347/ 10721) 
and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year would have been november we would take those shoes out and depending upon who is supposed to be the person at home it would not be the one who had worn them in the spring because he is growing in the meantime and uh and it may go to another another and i can remember we pass shoes down as many as four we children now my dad also repairing shoes 

Recording: (3348/ 10721) 
and when i started just an apprentice in the shop they said we will we will start at a dollar and a or that sounds pretty good you know in nineteen forty five in the fall one nineteen forty five so then it seems worked out in washington dc they came bill the geoh i build them right we found that that that would apply to our fordnesses too 

Recording: (3349/ 10721) 
i do not think they get the attention they need 

Recording: (3350/ 10721) 
the uh the doorknob and 

Recording: (3351/ 10721) 
no i i do not want to like i do not want to suspense like i just want to like i know trying new different things like like because the most music i listen to is like i am in base of it it is like base lines and like

Recording: (3367/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (3368/ 10721)

Recording: (3370/ 10721) 
they do really okay 

Recording: (3371/ 10721)

Recording: (3373/ 10721) 
and uh you know mothers have to work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that uh you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on uh that needs to be rest structured so 

Recording: (3374/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (3375/ 10721) 
no i mean like i said i think little kids are going to be little kids if that stuff was not on tv they are still going to act the same way they are still going to be walk around with toy guns and things like that playing in war or whatever 

Recording: (3376/ 10721) 
two year i off of the degree from marketing take all those figures and add up with see it is added up to a hundred percent see when i bought a house the finance year came and i went to his office and he said uh i wish no problem no problem you can get that house i said i can

Recording: (3378/ 10721) 
i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys hold in hands or what not it i guess it is just more because it is so different than like what you normally see or things like that 

Recording: (3379/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3380/ 10721) 
oh i am telling you

Recording: (3383/ 10721) 
say people who are rounded from their home or their office you know to remind it to go vote will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was it is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberto i am calling to remind it today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most bother freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way uh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for us such in such a school levy and if you need a ride let me know we have got them set up for you 

Recording: (3384/ 10721) 
i went to ou for about three months but i was just got out of school you know to 

Recording: (3385/ 10721) 
i think he really does 

Recording: (3386/ 10721) 
that is wrong for him to do that and he you know he is a man and that would tell him god did not put too many minutes on the earth and if he would still choose to do that that that i would not hate them or this own them or anything like that 

Recording: (3387/ 10721) 
it really does not look like i mean 

Recording: (3388/ 10721) 
at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play and i thought is he expecting uh to play this the solos or is he expecting can you bring in somebody <laugh> 

Recording: (3389/ 10721) 
that is an embarrassment for a college this size 

Recording: (3390/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3391/ 10721) 
and that the the the people who who most face that lie are the supposed beneficial areas of civil rights legislation um so uh i mean civil rights was an an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today they are are uh i mean it a see a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and 

Recording: (3392/ 10721) 
um actually oddlyly enough that is what i am putting in 

Recording: (3393/ 10721) 
tests yeah 

Recording: (3394/ 10721) 
and now they have the little tiny grape tomatoes that are so cute how would you see they are they are the size of grape yeah they are garly 

Recording: (3395/ 10721)

into the hill top area 

Recording: (3398/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3399/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3400/ 10721) 
oh <laugh> 

Recording: (3401/ 10721) 
um i do not know because i have not kept in contact with them i think i know of a couple that have 

Recording: (3402/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3403/ 10721) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefit it a lot from it now 

Recording: (3404/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (3405/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (3406/ 10721) 
but uh as i said i went to summer school too and 

Recording: (3407/ 10721) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (3408/ 10721)

Recording: (3409/ 10721)

you know there is things about my dad that that i went to work with and and he he is great and he is wonderful to meet i mean my dad it is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like where my mom had me he he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you would think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (3412/ 10721) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognized school so a degree from the house state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize because the big it is a big big name actually it would be more of a sell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credited but so 

Recording: (3413/ 10721) 
oh uh please watch some land what is wood is in news yeah water things like that 

Recording: (3414/ 10721) 
right which is what we look like 

Recording: (3415/ 10721) 
if if you did not own let us say on the school i mean you did not you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent uh at least it it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord <laugh> uh and i i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after school every past and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing 

Recording: (3416/ 10721) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (3417/ 10721) 
oh lots of people travel all over uh you know i mean that is i do not lots of people do you know i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but uh you know i i do tend to well the year

Recording: (3420/ 10721) 
better than us i guess <laugh> 

Recording: (3421/ 10721) 
oh <laugh> i do not yeah i think i think that that we both just i think is correctly together i know just in life they need a little bit better but um i do not know about boys names and i just he said one like when i was about three months that we both really liked but that was not really names were not really what we were gonna think you mean about that 

Recording: (3422/ 10721) 
but it just depends upon it still comes back to who you are now 

Recording: (3423/ 10721) 
a lot of pool actually uh we go to a bar called the other end because it is cheap and it is fun though 

Recording: (3424/ 10721) 
mavericks is gonna be ruined and she have felt guilty about it <laugh> not really <laugh> not really i mean i had this grading on it pretty much of it come to i mean i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was that was attempting to do the work uh i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off and uh but in terms of the curb i had a is and i had bees i had a few c is <laugh> yeah so 

Recording: (3425/ 10721) 
oh i feel funny that uh i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years until i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (3426/ 10721) 
yeah you have you follow the script and uh that is real funny too like you know you get uh they they listen to you like they monitor the calls and uh you know they listen to you and it is like the sheet like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know sent it in this way and like if you used this or whatever you know and like um i do not know it is just real weird 

Recording: (3427/ 10721) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (3428/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (3429/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3430/ 10721) 
so yeah i think um as a whole we have all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary i mean we do not have the same beliefs system and anything anymore so it is kind of like oh jeez <laugh> 

Recording: (3431/ 10721) 
yous spelling 

Recording: (3432/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (3433/ 10721)

Recording: (3434/ 10721) 
so uh men the security cops were up uh above us and they are predominately black you know and i do not know what happens on that and one time there is on like twenty i think people in our the whole uh put it in it was all in the same parakes and uh some guy said something off the color to one of them or something like that that you know and it it got kind of out of hand for a while but you know but god nothing really happened 

Recording: (3435/ 10721) 
i forget they have uh like way more than like they dwarf in the other state i think so that to me is not that is not adroable and then i i so that is one reason i would not vote for blood this 

Recording: (3436/ 10721) 
get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting the time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medication that are out in the time released and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time released and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to do so they go back to the six hour dosa you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they like to the lunch line and you know they just hate it yeah 

Recording: (3437/ 10721)

Recording: (3438/ 10721) 
right i mean paul is booming and i think and i think and i think i could not have put him in a family when he was in then fit and i think i would have quit if a family would not have been available but since the only one was available and i think he he is very social i i think he was ready for then or actually with the other kids and three days a week is not right 

Recording: (3439/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (3440/ 10721) 
and i am going to continue that for a long for a long period of time and become very up on 

Recording: (3441/ 10721) 
um you know you have to you know you do not have a choice but at the same time you do not right you do not want them to suffer but you want to keep them but it is whoop whoop i hope i did not move

Recording: (3599/ 10721) 
the bad plays of television things that they have on that programs they have on and i think that they have had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much for vanity there is too much sex there is too much just doing what i want i got to do my own thing that is why the when the i want to do my own thing he starts he says with the women is feminine this movement <laugh> <laugh>

the trouble is he does not get wise too much he is used about forty years of age and he said gosh i wish i would listen 

Recording: (3604/ 10721) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over 

Recording: (3605/ 10721) 
it is very hard

civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an allusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect

Recording: (3719/ 10721) 
and it was threatening kids with it and so they suspended in 

Recording: (3720/ 10721) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i was thinking it should be consider basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you run into for that um but but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (3721/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah 

Recording: (3722/ 10721)

Recording: (3727/ 10721) 
so that is why i just see it right now i should look 

Recording: (3728/ 10721) 
one thing okay go ahead well one thing uh i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe like lots of people do not is how columbus is grown up 

Recording: (3729/ 10721)

Recording: (3955/ 10721) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well that is my choice you and your husband it is like what are you making these things maybe not back specifically much just like general rules for good living in your church at the same one thing but realistically you think maybe something a little bit different but what do you mean about all that conflict oh 

Recording: (3956/ 10721)

Recording: (4052/ 10721) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is that is what happens to a lot of them they they come out of school all i dealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management there is you want the tax breaks you want the thing you know what i mean and then they like i have an uncle he is a vice president on the wall street from maryland she said you know he he got out of school he is very idealistic but now he

well all puttoing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff as as far as bringing it too together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (4064/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4065/ 10721) 
where they where they were going and and uh he worked in a trailer uh out in the yard you know

umhum 

Recording: (4074/ 10721) 
yeah they could be wrong yeah 

Recording: (4075/ 10721) 
that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is what we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are uh a parent getting giving allowance you do not giving the your kids uh money to do chores they normally expect them to do but you get them to sing in addition to develop more responsibility but we do not talk about responsibility on society they i i i darely are saying we are in the heck they say public 

Recording: (4076/ 10721) 
you can not see it in a day 

Recording: (4077/ 10721)

Recording: (4087/ 10721) 
get back to god get back to leaving in god in the values that the families should have i do not know how is that connected well god did not he should have go out and shoot your neighbor and he did not go out and tell you to steal from him and he did not tell you to uh ignore him the rest of your life he did not tell you that they are down there bleeding into the uh they are going to turn the other way i mean he wants you to help and be loving toward each other and and it is liking a lot of people today as i said it back that old me me me

Recording: (4177/ 10721) 
anything or i i i i really want to say i really think that that is most of it and i do not know how people i got a letter the other day and i can not remember from the name of the personality that was doing it just saying it about how you can find out to taking them right in and say do not have these kind of tv programs on any more where they use their poor penalty where they use the drinking where they use them doop and uh we are the use of all goody and i understand this thing about him being a

Recording: (4204/ 10721) 
you know what kind of an answer is that even if your answer is i do not know why you can not do it it just makes me uncomfortable you know that is a lot more fair than because i am the boss be or something like that and i think if you raise back to our kids and and just kind of sit down here with them you know kind of try to be i do not know that is the way that is the way my family has always been and it always seems to work really well for i 

Recording: (4205/ 10721)

Recording: (4213/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4214/ 10721) 
but if you love they do love someone you want them to do what you right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this is not over here i am not going to let get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one i am sorry you have done that dearly but and i love you dearly but i tried to teach you different i do not know where you went wrong i do not want to just wrong it every but you got to pay the penalty you

Recording: (4216/ 10721) 
you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4217/ 10721) 
that is when you take him to grandma like his house <laugh> that is what we do i do not know he is got together he is criminal night back we live with my mom and dad so he gets to see my side all the time but he does not get to see them as much so like when that night comes along good good or grandma <laugh> or like we take them to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets uh those free

oh on that on that do not care they got money people that got down 

Recording: (4219/ 10721) 
the birth controls issue became so personal and uh it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with uh what i thought was a clear conscience in what i did i do not have even regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (4220/ 10721) 
i guess i almost that i wish they would celebration every holiday so then they are exposed to all of it instead of none of it 

Recording: (4221/ 10721) 
calpley high schools but even there you know there was you know a a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on she does definitely not i have been going on and that was only on a very small over they were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students that just happened it so 

Recording: (4222/ 10721) 
they are growing up we push all this in you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government in society and and what we are allowed to to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people 

Recording: (4223/ 10721) 
but um 

Recording: (4224/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (4225/ 10721) 
i think there spends a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think and even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking them away from the uh the cousins i mean the the cousins have been stressing all over you need the family he needs something well there is a much closer family than your father and that that they love this  country and this stuff well then except the laws and follow them whether you even agree with them or not uh i i 

Recording: (4226/ 10721) 
so he would not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4227/ 10721) 
that is probably what i do i ignore to them till like august starts are just lying and starts paying attention 

Recording: (4228/ 10721) 
to be careful of that i asked my manager the other day she told me i am supposed to do this certain bank and i asked her i said well they told me i was not supposed to

Recording: (4234/ 10721) 
although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people playing and they are playing with their heart and they tell you because of the how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart on a bunch of your old fancy words and and a real comfortable setting you know that that he 

Recording: (4235/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4236/ 10721) 
um i have it personally good but i have seen uh i would personally research it if i was president uh documentaries and what not and things on twenty twenty which i do not wholeheartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes in your out has really seemed to work in california because 

Recording: (4237/ 10721)

Recording: (4244/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4245/ 10721)

Recording: (4246/ 10721)

Recording: (4247/ 10721) 
i did get better grades last nine weeks did not i wow it is not amazing you were taking your bill then some connection here <laugh> so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let us just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we will write them down and say oh well that is nice wish you did that without any problem at all this nine weeks that you have not been able to focus on that maybe does not does hope you some maybe you just you know not giving it credit

Recording: (4258/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4259/ 10721) 
so indirectlyically it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (4260/ 10721) 
i have become visual decentized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather worse events in history that still are very i still find disturbing um and uh also hang out and cool i 

Recording: (4261/ 10721) 
i think that is that would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4262/ 10721)

Recording: (4266/ 10721) 
and uh oh did they 

Recording: (4267/ 10721)

Recording: (4269/ 10721) 
for felthers and everything but i think you know they get along these kids and they do not care about the school but they will they lead it early because they know they can do it 

Recording: (4270/ 10721) 
and uh you know it oh we have got our we are talking to that you know 

Recording: (4271/ 10721) 
well it is like the i 

Recording: (4272/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4273/ 10721) 
you know and it was in the but do not get me wrong he told me he was going to have me i locked up for child abuse so i would do the house in the car and take them downtown and took them inside and told him to tell them people because they are going to lock him up 

Recording: (4274/ 10721) 
you know but you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is twenty two i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to the look for a perfect you need to look for what you need to check out and you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work study job <laugh> you know 

Recording: (4275/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (4276/ 10721) 
and poor people can not do that um so after all of a sudden on with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that the attorney and the firm got a third plus she had to pay office expenses so really she was probably let with only about three hundred thousand dollars which have used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person uh but a very stupid person 

Recording: (4277/ 10721) 
what a one million dollar check they hit the the door shut you know 

Recording: (4278/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (4279/ 10721)

<laugh> what would they have to gain <laugh> um 

Recording: (4287/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4288/ 10721) 
a policeer computers that my plants sit in the corner and then have my little paper sack 

Recording: (4289/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4290/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4291/ 10721) 
you know or a conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my here is my dog my labrador and he uh full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting in uh uh they were objective you know and and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and chunting things up and 

Recording: (4292/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4293/ 10721) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the outside and then you got all these people you know have been in the fights in my neighborhood and well my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out out landish behavior i mean i caught i actually wrote up on uh a couple people 

Recording: (4294/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4295/ 10721) 
yeah she is almost in the family 

Recording: (4296/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4297/ 10721) 
well i get the sense that if there are disciplined problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun in ways around the school you know that the big thing now but just that you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support across through the even news  administration that they do have is that they have to wait until something is pretty pretty regious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (4298/ 10721) 
oh every all focus changes it really does 

Recording: (4299/ 10721) 
well i think all through growing up there is always been you know different kind of kids 

Recording: (4300/ 10721) 
um yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up with john because i would of like failed everything anyway so but um and i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like you know i no mean her and my other friend live in down meanered 

Recording: (4301/ 10721) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of you know america just being like the country of access like access positions access food access food access food access aid access money you know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back back you know this is i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and 

Recording: (4302/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4303/ 10721) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have uh a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spend it in the second half of the day just hanging out so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know 

Recording: (4304/ 10721) 
so you are 

Recording: (4305/ 10721) 
doing their seventh and doing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendant certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (4306/ 10721) 
uh i think they lost they go to the state lost because they just out there renting and leaving and after a while got out of hand i 

Recording: (4307/ 10721) 
b twu also uh radio on music in mid ohio uh our recording last year yeah a beethoven is ninth gun on music in middle ohio <laugh> yeah we used the other line college choir umhum 

Recording: (4308/ 10721) 
i do not know i i do not know if it was drugs or <laugh> something ridiculous and they they done a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force our son a lot of other officials are are pretty much in agreement that he should be dine and he feels like like he is just not going to and that we do not have any um the the the mayor can not nobody can actually make him resigned that that is something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as you know to work it was peter was saying i am going to make him do this which is something that 

Recording: (4309/ 10721) 
well when i was a senior in high school i wish my parents would push me to do something practical but i am glad they did not because it gave me a chance to make my own decision 

Recording: (4310/ 10721) 
oh no 

Recording: (4311/ 10721) 
i do not know i mean i think it is kind of ridiculous for kids to pay did you go them you know or if they get caught doing like d sales my all my cousins went to the new sales and if they got shut caught you and um they have their pay 

Recording: (4312/ 10721) 
well like um i knew uh one of my friends from somebody was uh because cat does a lot of acting and stuff and like um my one friend uh uh new newver like they did plays together like down at like columbus junior theater or something and like that so like um that is how we got introduced to whatever it we spend friends for a while couple of years yeah 

Recording: (4313/ 10721) 
of the people that land it there is in this the saramoney calling it an e b which is a sweat large and a lot of people will talk about sweat large um involves heating up stones in a fire and uh putting the stones in uh lodge and pouring water over them and closing sing the door and singing songs it is not a songs it is not a uh steam room 

Recording: (4314/ 10721) 
should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that uh many the uh the gaves like they turn people against uh the busting action programs and the busing did that people is going to turn people against uh thegays like they turn people against black backs for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties 

Recording: (4315/ 10721) 
was it true this year about it you know it is like you know 

Recording: (4316/ 10721) 
um i mean they did not really do anything too expensive on it they basically as far as religion classes you know they would basically told up the catholic church believed about it and how they feel about it but i mean they did not really today am more supported or anything like that i mean they they basically did realize that it is more up to the person i mean 

Recording: (4317/ 10721)

Recording: (4355/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4356/ 10721) 
and getting back to the profality and stuff that was another one was in the favor some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something almost they are little kids maybe six or seven rate walked in there and said what the h you done four letter words is this four and the father is standing looks at the front end after the kid is water out off says a minute well where in the east do they all learn to talk like that these things came so away right away see see it is the ones it is the ones that are teaching the kids and it it is all

Recording: (4365/ 10721)

Recording: (4378/ 10721) 
camp half tank gas

i think example is probably the best uh they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionateated school uh very spiritual young man uh more so than his brother that is and they always have to tap away that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel 

Recording: (4380/ 10721) 
so you know and i mean we have more fun on our own uh where i grew up i grew up like i said right over here on on cange you know there used to be a pond over here at the military we would go fishing there every  everyday or

Recording: (4385/ 10721) 
and until the consumer becomes on the equal knowledge level as the uh it is always going to be an equitable and you are going to have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress an age it becomes a liability but then the developer i said well let us see well we can make condos down size let me was just want to make this we want to make this margin of profit yeah we do but what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (4386/ 10721)

Recording: (4433/ 10721) 
okay well a few years ago there was this big fuss that you know we have got to close to some schools so we did not you know in rome and droping it is you know just the way the population goes and fromin is dropping is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so it is close and it is just big studying they target us on to close well there was a big uproar from the people this kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close to the board back down and change its money the next year they came out on the studies they need more schools but there was not a money for it

Recording: (4435/ 10721) 
yeah i run into that on i think part of it was the high school at that time and i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealth here type people who either they just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (4436/ 10721) 
like a double standard for black people they are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are races towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously they are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just a obnoxious and you do not wanna deal with um i mean it is basically the same thing <laugh> right

Recording: (4441/ 10721) 
well i i think we oh yeah we are we are church gore is but just to be going church of course is not uh is not being faithful i think it is just uh sharing yourself uh with one another and daily lives uh listening to someone out reaching to someone where it might be that is uh the mystery that uh i think our our our lord is giveness 

Recording: (4442/ 10721) 
we throw the book away onto some of these other guys i mean they throw the key away on some of these guys and you know we want to set them and an an example and you know this one guy had one do you why two years ago so we really have he is got to be in jail for five years you know then this judge i mean he is got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he is still and he is still attached <laugh> monday morning he goes to work

umhum 

Recording: (4444/ 10721)

Recording: (4445/ 10721) 
because then you know what is something major happens that first and then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to to help them ohs and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many actions happen to children like he will always breaking arms and stuff

Recording: (4451/ 10721) 
and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student on some school uh it would be nice if we had more of an open environment schools and the teachers really had the time i can to notice that maybe somebody had a problem in the talk to them about it and then sent them on that counseling one way um just because if you are going to teach it to a a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them would probably be making correct 

Recording: (4452/ 10721) 
maybe 

Recording: (4453/ 10721) 
i know the only thing that was really down there before i moved out was the lincoln le back tower <laugh> the is the shortest one <laugh> but but of course the university is just about the same in some ways the stadium and all that

Recording: (4519/ 10721)

and it just sort of sparked an interest in me i guess and and just grew from there 

Recording: (4528/ 10721) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them about our school um i think a lot of it is it is it is really you way as far as you as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they it took it being ap classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think they have options

well it is not that there is been too much gross i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (4584/ 10721) 
or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and trying to get them out of that hopefully even if you save has of them it is better than yeah 

Recording: (4585/ 10721)

Recording: (4594/ 10721) 
to back it up but so i suppose put them on uh trial for another year which would be up to be uh you know but that is exactly what they were planning on you know wearing me down like i said knowing that i do not have the money to throw in there and say hey you know um but they know for a while that we had all the evidence that we had too so uh that just push upon it for another year 

Recording: (4595/ 10721)

Recording: (4674/ 10721) 
boy 

Recording: (4675/ 10721)

Recording: (4676/ 10721)

i think it would 

Recording: (4678/ 10721) 
oh i can not think too much of them right now but uh 

Recording: (4679/ 10721) 
yeah but i have gotten more influence i think maybe i am not sure i am hoping i have got more influence over him than his father does 

Recording: (4680/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4681/ 10721) 
you rather call the north show actually 

Recording: (4682/ 10721) 
people can not on their 

Recording: (4683/ 10721) 
hum 

Recording: (4684/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4685/ 10721) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take it  advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay on that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had that i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work 

Recording: (4686/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4687/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4688/ 10721) 
if if you would take all of the the votes you one by and spread it out across the nation by one vote person per poor precinct one vote per precinct you know they are just been one additional vote either way and any of those precings you know he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and they used to have a list of elections that would decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school level campaigns and many of them are decided by one two 

Recording: (4689/ 10721) 
anything else is a hard way failure you need to be fixed somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (4690/ 10721) 
hit the mark sometimes though <laugh> he gets to clean the toilet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (4691/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4692/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4693/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4694/ 10721) 
would be would be interested in i mean i mean not just for the kids sakes but would be interested on their own be half in in teaching the child what uh 

Recording: (4695/ 10721) 
right and they they were actually able to select a couple from a they talked to a lawyer who range his options and she had a file and they you know threw kind of a bunch of questions in the answers type thing able to limit it in to three couples and they like the first couple they met so 

Recording: (4696/ 10721) 
yeah uh i got a service my parents were older and uh kind of felt them over getting uh deer around i am going to help take care of them so 

Recording: (4697/ 10721) 
i mean i i was very good math um very good math i mean i was i did pretty good in all of the subjects jeez 

Recording: (4698/ 10721) 
but it does not always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the the guy that they uh uh bacucuted here in ohio last fall did you know about it you 

Recording: (4699/ 10721) 
that uh they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their poor is opinions because i i for one example the pokey man craze my son did not know what pokey man was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know 

Recording: (4700/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4701/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4702/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4703/ 10721) 
it would be nice but now um so 

Recording: (4704/ 10721) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4705/ 10721) 
i keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young i have five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking eleven years oh 

Recording: (4706/ 10721) 
yeah and he is got control over that because i i mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman uh that baby sits and she did very very well she did all that stuff that i would like to be done she took them to the library she had nap time at a certain time they were in you know the lay down and that is just totally different uh uh the grandmothers 

Recording: (4707/ 10721) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (4708/ 10721) 
you know when i just fight i just do not i just do not like this it is not because it is something that when i look long term is just something that i want to do with for the rest of my life and i said no interest in it you know and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible at somebody before you know people get into situations and they marry people that you just you from the outside you can look at and you can think hey you are nuts you know that is never going to work <laugh> you know so they think that you are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to that is going to work and be positive yeah 

Recording: (4709/ 10721) 
it was just so i did not object to that one at all 

Recording: (4710/ 10721) 
i i i would find that hard to believe <laugh> 

Recording: (4711/ 10721) 
<laugh> yeah 

Recording: (4712/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4713/ 10721) 
i would say of uh i think the the the bb a generally sees on the average five seven ten something like that a day he another all of them homeless 

Recording: (4714/ 10721)

Recording: (4715/ 10721) 
she said that it is like uh some people will work there like i could not imagine working complete nights you know i mean i like working two thirty two eleven i think i would rather work like maybe like new to eight i would be better because then it is like i mean i am more tend to stay up late anyway it is just because it is like oh it is whatever but like i do not want to have to get up early either like i can never imagine having an nine to five child like that that feel horrible 

Recording: (4716/ 10721) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (4717/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4718/ 10721) 
the government is always good for money <laugh> 

Recording: (4719/ 10721) 
<laugh> but it was interesting uh they did have uh assembleies where they they had religious some beliefs um religion was not uh all in it was not all in the base of in the school but they did have some blesses and uh for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking uh 

Recording: (4720/ 10721) 
umhum umhum but uh it was i could say i say uh she probably probably thinks the same way now she would been hearing on that i am trouble with boys and everything you know she is growing up and in that part would uh could probably would have been in a house about that kind of stuff depending on the how bad 

Recording: (4721/ 10721) 
um it is pretty dangerous drug i would say for the most part um not so much they getting high part of it but just what goes into it 

Recording: (4722/ 10721) 
well we were i we have read that but we were invadinged over so it is not that far away we did not hear about it for a couple of days but i heard that the fall type was on every aspect of his life every aspect of the search but do people really need to know that to they need to have it driven home and i think then and i think at that point that is where the media or just they are sensational usually is using it and 

Recording: (4723/ 10721) 
to the other side 

Recording: (4724/ 10721) 
it is a law that uh you have to pay for your accumulatedulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me four so i came it back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but but uh i i know that territory i know where i am going <laugh> <laugh> 

Recording: (4725/ 10721) 
yeah i think i have to drive on the stress <laugh> i think it keeps me uh going or something but i do have to do something that is accomplishing something i do not want to sit in an office if i already done that day in and day out working for other people that i do not even approve of that are making way too much money anyway you know and 

Recording: (4726/ 10721)

Recording: (4732/ 10721) 
yes 

Recording: (4733/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4734/ 10721) 
<laugh> i started at the real bottom of it <laugh> 

Recording: (4735/ 10721) 
uh the younger kids would not think anything about it 

Recording: (4736/ 10721) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch times that is a big meal a day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (4737/ 10721)

Recording: (4758/ 10721) 
in <laugh> i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but she what she is bringing about is developing a character person to bring about this spirge howard in a person that is going to carry them all through life she is also um tighting more than tighting probably which uh i always uh the author that said ten percent tiding new inflation he knew great amount economics ten percent and ten percent and 

Recording: (4759/ 10721)

Recording: (4760/ 10721) 
well and i think it really still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid things would make their mom and dad happy you know would i to act this way with that make my mom in because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know oh and they learn by watching you do it too i mean my 

Recording: (4761/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (4773/ 10721) 
i have to get a job and supporting myself so 

Recording: (4774/ 10721)

Recording: (4775/ 10721) 
getting like you know nineties and above but twenty five percent are getting f is and d is 

Recording: (4776/ 10721) 
five years 

Recording: (4777/ 10721) 
yeah it is a really disciplined school but a lot of rebionate at the same time 

Recording: (4778/ 10721) 
yeah we did we had a uh the cold land parties they are parties where everybody takes the computer and you hook them up to into a network and then you play games 

Recording: (4779/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4780/ 10721) 
all right 

Recording: (4781/ 10721) 
so you knew it you have heard about that probably 

Recording: (4782/ 10721) 
good 

Recording: (4783/ 10721) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much rain as a matter of fact if you are my supervisor i am lamble and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4784/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4785/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (4786/ 10721) 
that that is going to be a problem they said bring bring water you are going to definitely they they have no dress code which is nice so i am just going to be sure it is some good walking shoes and and it is easier because it could get rough yeah real rough i that 

Recording: (4787/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4788/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4789/ 10721) 
i think it would help i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people 

Recording: (4790/ 10721) 
you know i got to where so i was raised 

Recording: (4791/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4792/ 10721) 
always had these uh repair old notables and she stopped them getting an idea for a poor maybe she she wrote quite a few times some of them real good book boutary i thought most of them of more or less uh religious nature and moral nature and 

Recording: (4793/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4794/ 10721) 
so she is doing that and uh 

Recording: (4795/ 10721) 
yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4796/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (4797/ 10721) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they will probably be exposed to you know the gave must be in i i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in jobs you know about sex and your sex classes were pretty but on the other you know for me that fine i do not know our friends that have eleven year olds that is going to public schools i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry 

Recording: (4798/ 10721) 
not at all <laugh> he is always had very definite opinions of how his life should be 

Recording: (4799/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4800/ 10721) 
to protect people that are wealthy and they commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so uh i wanna going to the wall <laugh> did not want to go into paralegal i was looking into that and the lady kept hounding me and telling me you know uh maybe you could get in it to make a difference so i am like i would i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a lawyer i bring them 

Recording: (4801/ 10721) 
like 

Recording: (4802/ 10721) 
you do 

Recording: (4803/ 10721) 
so i do not know i i think a lot of it is the family unit breaking down in general you know and secondly i think to be honest i think the media is gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it um and i do think uh you know they know they are going to get recognized they are going to have their name go down the history unfortunately uh i think that has something to do with it too uh and it is frustrating 

Recording: (4804/ 10721) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (4805/ 10721) 
i see i mean you see the computer can not be wrong he said 

Recording: (4806/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4807/ 10721) 
no i we actually have season tickets that people that went clear up and the seat back um but we enjoy it because we a lot of times we walk in 

Recording: (4808/ 10721) 
oh because uh some of the newer would yet there is like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it they are proper planes that are like five times less noisy 

Recording: (4809/ 10721) 
and then a couple years later he was working on a job in a plumber coated fabric plant which is that makes oh coda fabric they make uh the main thing is uh auto up on the street car up on the street anyway they had big rolling machines that roll this stuff out and those fumes came off but so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (4810/ 10721) 
yeah i remember was all swall back when i was a kid uh like i said i grew up down here it was mostly farm lands when i grew up around here 

Recording: (4811/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4812/ 10721) 
some of them are athletes they are pretty much just preppy student council i am good at school but bad outside of school they go out and party on out of school but they join all that uh students against drug use programs 

Recording: (4813/ 10721)

Recording: (4815/ 10721) 
it is a good place they even stop playing the gett of music they had this juke box and it was horrible they played the same three songs of like poorly offensive lyrics and no melody oncever 

Recording: (4816/ 10721)

Recording: (4819/ 10721) 
back in the early seventies and then i transferred to worthinton in seventies six and i have been there ever since 

Recording: (4820/ 10721) 
i bet yep 

Recording: (4821/ 10721) 
yeah he is yeah he is twenty six 

Recording: (4822/ 10721) 
yeah exactly that will solve the problem 

Recording: (4823/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (4824/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4825/ 10721) 
they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if a if a kid has bad behavior or you know about it and that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting blowing you know hot wiring 

Recording: (4826/ 10721) 
oh wow 

Recording: (4827/ 10721) 
okay i think if you are able to cook two back pick up pretty cool you know 

Recording: (4828/ 10721) 
oh yeah they should they cut up in their are pulling this baby out in this little hole of this lady is stomach and i just uh i had heart surgery when i was younger and so i had had lots of needles in those type of things and i when it comes to needles and and that kind of stuff and just kind of squeamish about it you know so that stuff i just i just do not want to see it 

Recording: (4829/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (4830/ 10721) 
of the year i mean it just got to the point where i had enough and i did not want to go anymore 

Recording: (4831/ 10721) 
but right now with his attitude the way it is i would say that me and my family are better off not having him stir an up above joges conflict or whatever 

Recording: (4832/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4833/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (4834/ 10721) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was well maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school <laugh> because there were pregnant girls in my high school yeah 

Recording: (4835/ 10721) 
and uh well actually a neighbor boy who is draft number was smaller than mine 

Recording: (4836/ 10721) 
sheesh does not sound right to the airwaves or to the riding some of those mysteries going on here and you found they do not they have them difficulties well the voice became acceptable before i was a no no you know it is acceptable and then you had uh the celebrities is becoming more is another oh hey we do not we do not we do not get no okay then we have the idea of doing away with cash gold total the italian backing i think it was kennedy was the one that did that 

Recording: (4837/ 10721) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (4838/ 10721) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know of pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out or some of them being worried about i i a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it about it so yeah but you know i it is i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (4839/ 10721) 
okay one two three four five testing testing at the <laugh> yeah when i was did you have my father got this paper car and the days when they were those big you know the wheel 

Recording: (4840/ 10721) 
can you hold any 

Recording: (4841/ 10721) 
that is what everybody when i tell people i play that is what everybody says but it seems to me that in the instrument can be hard depending i mean i can not see how anybody can play for example but they are something that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with single fingering 

Recording: (4842/ 10721) 
and you uh it is just like the game battle ship pretty much you know a four a two eight seven and uh well off a three dollar one i have won one probably four out of five you know in that i have not bought that many of them but in that rate right there four out of five not too bad got my mom one on her birthday she got fifteen dollars and umhum 

Recording: (4843/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4844/ 10721) 
uh maybe maybe i would like i said like it is really weird most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because i have lived in ohio for so long but when here is little is when i think you learn noisy like i love the old detroit tiger from the eighties and like that is what i learned to to like 

Recording: (4845/ 10721) 
umhum yeah yeah if it is nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (4846/ 10721) 
it is always gonna be somebody can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toes but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because 

Recording: (4847/ 10721) 
and they can not find it and and you know and you know like our i look on the catalog where it says m e m number that that that would be a membership number and people i call all right but <laugh> i do not know they i i they do not i really want to get a job that is like in a warehouse or something something really easy where i can just like load boxes or something because i never have time to really i mean like i trying to do like that and i trying to do it ago but it is like but we work two thirty to eleven so it is like by the time you get home it is 

Recording: (4848/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4849/ 10721) 
i mean i i i do not know enough about it to really say but it i can not i mean it i do not know where they got that 

Recording: (4850/ 10721) 
she was but i admire her more <laugh> because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going the bit of litigious test it was just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of democratic party they would nominationate such people as uh mcgyvering who had you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line  left 

Recording: (4851/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4852/ 10721) 
but our belief is that it did not it it needed to be restored and we believe um i do not know if you have heard about jose smith or 

Recording: (4853/ 10721) 
sure um i grew up in limohio and which is only about an hour and a half from here north uh i came here in nineteen ninety one i believe here being columbus um i got married about three years ago and right now i am in the process of generally love everything i have worked all my life um until about the past two years and i have just been working like part time and um doing crafts and things like that because i am 

Recording: (4854/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (4855/ 10721) 
been them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they are doing 

Recording: (4856/ 10721) 
yeah but 

Recording: (4857/ 10721) 
in adequate but that was even through nursing school i mean those were not things that were discussed you get special conference to get information on that 

Recording: (4858/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4859/ 10721) 
get i do not know it all works itself out he he is have another day he started them on tax and he will just start fumes 

Recording: (4860/ 10721) 
kids start dressinging and getting it click together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that that is not really she would be their role but uh if they care enough they should call the parents and they would look for worrying about your son he misses a lot of school or he starting to dress really you know i sometimes when it should not be the dress has a lot to do with them but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress 

Recording: (4861/ 10721) 
double e major 

Recording: (4862/ 10721) 
okay so uh he got it dispelled from catholic school for behavior problems 

Recording: (4863/ 10721) 
do they 

Recording: (4864/ 10721) 
<laugh> yeah 

Recording: (4865/ 10721) 
not i not really i mean i do not think they would come to any more difficult conclusion than guys had coming up to 

Recording: (4866/ 10721) 
hope the curb <laugh> 

Recording: (4867/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (4868/ 10721) 
i do not know i the the kids or uh they are like something in the rub bringing and i do not know what it is uh thank goodness now my kids ever took that sort of attitude and uh i would like to i would like to think that my wife and i set them a good example hm 

Recording: (4869/ 10721) 
um yeah that is what they suggest doing is two years of medical get a phd and then do last years of medical 

Recording: (4870/ 10721) 
so we walked across the street to the church 

Recording: (4871/ 10721) 
he is 

Recording: (4872/ 10721) 
yeah and they are also talking about because uh uh the actors the reason they are ending it is in fact the actors do not want to do it there was talk i do not know if they are still pursuing this that they would have new characters take over the role and i mean the character developments the most important part i think uh so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that they are getting these things kind of open 

Recording: (4873/ 10721) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that lee way <laugh> but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more or i am in a finity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of uh not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much <laugh> yeah yeah 

Recording: (4874/ 10721) 
and uh 

Recording: (4875/ 10721) 
so they knew that this bush name would bring out a lot of money which it has he is got a lot of money to work with and you know that does not seem fair either i do not think you know the average person in the united states the average person uh does not think to your phone leticians should be bought you know 

Recording: (4876/ 10721)

Recording: (4900/ 10721) 
and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and thing for myself and so i am exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle that and so when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in a lot of trouble about on the whole racial thing because uh i remember them in school where i was in the sleep the white students were 

Recording: (4901/ 10721) 
yeah yeah and that is the thing about the schools too you know i i totally disagree with uniforms you know unless it is all slacks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms in their short and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said hey you know here this is you know he would not met me in

Recording: (4993/ 10721) 
they are they are wonderful everybody always even the individual i just do not know what you are doing we have come and take care of mine for me and it it is in fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value there your opinions and i treat them everybody said she am home is weird she talks to a strange it is because i talk to them like i talk to you at at whatever age they are you know i do not yeah i do not talk down to the kids i

Recording: (4995/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (4996/ 10721) 
that was rough 

Recording: (4997/ 10721) 
and then they are going to say they want to nail their parents you know their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what that kids doing 

Recording: (4998/ 10721) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the library is connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of good access in any system in what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out into the public look in the public see and do it it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the way it you know people you know people anywhere can connect we only worked with library is before and now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody 

Recording: (4999/ 10721) 
they know more knowledge i would not say they are more socially mature or more um um i mean there is even sweet little preschool girls that do not say please and thank you you know you have to remind them 

Recording: (5000/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5001/ 10721)

Recording: (5003/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5004/ 10721)

Recording: (5005/ 10721) 
they should have on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they still wanna move on 

Recording: (5006/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (5007/ 10721) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a psychology undergraduate so <laugh> yeah 

Recording: (5008/ 10721) 
um no which is um very grateful he did like go pass my parents parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though the public record like who owns the house um luckily we have not had that because we purchased the house my husband and i before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the he he just has my made made money on it but uh no luckily 

Recording: (5009/ 10721) 
so it brings that down and it is like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the tests at both schools i will betcha they are all about about the same 

Recording: (5010/ 10721) 
yeah oh i do not know thats one you stay away from yeah 

Recording: (5011/ 10721) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain <laugh> it is just coming down all over the place hale and lightning 

Recording: (5012/ 10721) 
i mean you could probably write about thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your how many years do you have two three 

Recording: (5013/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5014/ 10721) 
forties like the limit 

Recording: (5015/ 10721) 
i think they need to educate me on what is important to them and i will you know oh i do not even respect as much as i can but even people with in different i mean a catholic is not a catholic to my opinion i mean there is some old time catholics i mean like my mom <laugh> i mean that they just are very 

Recording: (5016/ 10721) 
well now they do not 

Recording: (5017/ 10721) 
does not happen overnight 

Recording: (5018/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5019/ 10721) 
so really that is about it i have a dog he is outside right now and that is it for my kids 

Recording: (5020/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5021/ 10721) 
to be a lot more accepted i think here even though it might be kind of i would not do that on the other but if i i felt like that was what i was doing all the time so <laugh> full time 

Recording: (5022/ 10721) 
<laugh> you know what i mean it is uh i mean we are i hope we are getting to the place we know that that uh 

Recording: (5023/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5024/ 10721) 
there and everything that uh they will tend to talk to maybe you were talking to somebody else then uh like in the thorties if they are not believe it anymore they say 

Recording: (5025/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5026/ 10721) 
<laugh> yeah exactly 

Recording: (5027/ 10721) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background of some sort they can not see anything real difference i mean from the most part they have beable to do anything else than a guy can do so 

Recording: (5028/ 10721) 
yeah so 

Recording: (5029/ 10721) 
i want i do not want somebody i i want them to be able to feel like they can punish them and they can pray and they can 

Recording: (5030/ 10721) 
you get aggravating i mean you get to be older you know this is some of those issues <laugh> can be very aggravating 

Recording: (5031/ 10721) 
see i do not want that to happen to me because i just that is i mean i had a guy that i did start dating one of my son with a baby but um it just he got he fell in love with me 

Recording: (5032/ 10721) 
i can not imagine that it would have i mean i am sure brazil would have been an even more different experience but i think it was more just a resentment for sort of everything about america and what what their fed it was a real love hate relationship 

Recording: (5033/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5034/ 10721) 
um i i certainly spent most of my time in the areas that i grew up i mean i do not 

Recording: (5035/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5036/ 10721) 
bond card trips one one uh other families is in uh let us see oregon the coast uh forget the name of the town i do not far it is it is along the i think it is along the coast in oregon uh neer hugeine or something like that and uh the other is in louisiana 

Recording: (5037/ 10721) 
i am on the last line and uh uh leave it to bea 

Recording: (5038/ 10721) 
yeah basically for the entire summer and then if i like it uh i will be i will be en rolling so 

Recording: (5039/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5040/ 10721) 
he was tough but he was he was always tough and we did not realize that for years we did not have anything to compare to his the only one kid we got uh he was very this i call it just total you know we were talking about things that happen to him he said you must have had a terrible time for raising him because he was not an easy kid we did not know any difference 

Recording: (5041/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5042/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5043/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (5044/ 10721) 
but but at that at that at that phd was given to you if they lower the standards if they lower the standards for you to get into graduate school it would not that be challenging for you to great they lords it for me my sister did not oh she had a rough time getting the button now i can get any of that i have got a little more of her 

Recording: (5045/ 10721) 
those are unsaddlingling times though you know 

Recording: (5046/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5047/ 10721) 
they probably would have been about seniors in high schoolers though 

Recording: (5048/ 10721) 
but that is because i am not home a lot and like i said my wife is here now her mom is just moved to texas so she is living down to texas and she is got brothers and sisters all over the united states 

Recording: (5049/ 10721) 
not in my lifetime he would have to probably be a classic a 

Recording: (5050/ 10721)

himself in the two elections he ran in uh most real democrats the warm babies of the world many you know congressmen and and senators just like clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough uh i like clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either just get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a moderating 

Recording: (5095/ 10721) 
it is probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (5096/ 10721)

Recording: (5097/ 10721) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in uh setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up and so then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (5098/ 10721) 
umhum

Recording: (5108/ 10721) 
you know you can not say and now and it is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract area is like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at 

Recording: (5109/ 10721) 
yeah

Recording: (5191/ 10721) 
that is that is what i would i would think in that case i mean i mean because the dominant culture i i mean is always going to be accessible to them 

Recording: (5192/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5193/ 10721) 
i think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister is wet stinking hair because it is called the cigarette smoke for some reason so wet stinking hair white because i was driving into it and uh and then more time passes so so i mean in determine length of time later um i i look over at the police officer just standing on one side and the cops are there basically to make sure i do not freak out and then finallyunk in and i was like the cops are here so you do not freak i am like well i am not really in any danger breaking out and 

Recording: (5194/ 10721) 
because they like it they like going that is the way they came to college football was secondary 

Recording: (5195/ 10721) 
yeah that is how we get so much money he says i we will be paid this much and i will be given this many this much minimum per day or i am not working for you and they usually say no no no we will not do that you know and then they will call back a week later okay we will take you he has some really good stories about that oh yeah yeah is quality is not the best and also with uh unix which is 

Recording: (5196/ 10721) 
anyother you know using the kid as a medium uh or their two television do not listen to their kids or they did not um i do not wanna say selfish but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog take some time out of your your your schedule and um and not spend enough time with the kids you know they are working whatnot and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and 

Recording: (5197/ 10721) 
have you ever met somebody like that any 

Recording: (5198/ 10721) 
well it is well let us put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off of government agencies if i wanted to i wanted to be a crook i could i could be a crook and uh i could have people run me at house and let me come back to the movie in there 

Recording: (5199/ 10721) 
mick got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it is like oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming so i i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who were messing around with it have come back in so i i do not know exactly what you mean yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (5200/ 10721) 
coupe is uh campus you night for the faith that is um she had gone graduated from indians university of ohio and got familiar with uh camps because they were nice and so ford and went out to to calibut work for northern illinois they went back working for the inner city area of chicago and found ourselves they should like students feel better and when i be looking at her people say you are crazy young lady you are twenty five and you are moving to the city they are for my gritty alley here 

Recording: (5201/ 10721) 
and you you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now for a columbish you could not do that the much you could over there because you could walk around on the ramp over there and that always you 

Recording: (5202/ 10721) 
that we should have never been in we were you know they say we come around the mountain like they are in the mountain here 

Recording: (5203/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5204/ 10721) 
oh really 

Recording: (5205/ 10721) 
no i do not 

Recording: (5206/ 10721) 
to make me healthy or whatever because i vote again really healthy 

Recording: (5207/ 10721) 
which every kid in the world plays with 

Recording: (5208/ 10721) 
it was mostly caucasian and very few asian another ethnicities 

Recording: (5209/ 10721) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational on keep them they are making it even more sensationaly type than uh uh john kennedy type 

Recording: (5210/ 10721) 
oh man <laugh> 

Recording: (5211/ 10721) 
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up you know uh lot of the nurses even who are former addicts you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they were not doing phone pro to call and of course me i would be the one saying hey you are not phone pro to call and they would say well you know i am i am a former i am a former addict i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (5212/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5213/ 10721) 
i think that basically that is that not shows a brief a point in their life where you know their their hours as far as going out and killing themselves but do you want to kill themselves slowly by drink in themselves of death or uh smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh per crack or whatever and uh they just living in the house i mean 

Recording: (5214/ 10721) 
yeah exactly and it is just uh it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way i do think you access it would help us access where we are or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that they are on place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing umhum 

Recording: (5215/ 10721) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time uh and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh so i think some of a is it gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and uh you know it is just a matter who i vote for they are going to lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was interesting to me uh our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to 

Recording: (5216/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5217/ 10721) 
what i am saying when i talk to them or my mother very nice human being and a bunch of people i do not know 

Recording: (5218/ 10721)

uh that like you have to do something like it is more of a this big recession to do anything you have to put on like all these coats more and more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like go to the park and sit and it is fine but like here you know you get flash everywhere and i think if it says something to do you just can not like drive around and waste time because it is because it is miserable 

Recording: (5260/ 10721) 
you are from where 

Recording: (5261/ 10721) 
i really do not think we did for the most part i can not see any real big problem or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president uh honestly um although i do not really see too many sex problems i definitely do see guys still being 

Recording: (5262/ 10721)

Recording: (5273/ 10721) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5274/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5275/ 10721) 
so i can sleep in 

Recording: (5276/ 10721) 
no i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous uh but i think that comes with the with the bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems um but now i mean that is really that is really all that i notice it is obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (5277/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5278/ 10721) 
and you learn what you have to do to get through the test of course i did that while i was here at school 

Recording: (5279/ 10721) 
it like his life <laugh> 

Recording: (5280/ 10721) 
and obviously a lot more dangerous and i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like  college or whatever 

Recording: (5281/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5282/ 10721) 
there was a little bit well quite a bit of it was you know some of the people in the group did not play sports but it was not all from one sport or another it was football ball wrestling it was usually like the best football players the best wrestling 

Recording: (5283/ 10721) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (5284/ 10721) 
that is just today but when we as a society say oh gee he struggless i would say well let us lower the this thing let us throw it in bar a little more let us let you know gosh oh hey <laugh> scooney he did not make that last shot by last night eight eight eight time out let us get a screen two way minutes to make <laugh> listen wait a minute let me shoot he gets two way minutes to try it

Recording: (5286/ 10721)

Recording: (5289/ 10721) 
no this all started along before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that guess the baby is going to be born right i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but he is off of your hobbies now uh and she is she is great 

Recording: (5290/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (5291/ 10721) 
against them in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5292/ 10721) 
yeah they went and won the super bowl and they went back and lost the super bowl so 

Recording: (5293/ 10721) 
that was always too subjective for me 

Recording: (5294/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (5295/ 10721) 
yeah i was going to see most of them are 

Recording: (5296/ 10721) 
for the rest of my life and so be it you know i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscious or dangerous out there by that yeah that is basically where i have been you know um i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college and played baseball um due to injuries you know um meves and shoulder i just i was very i was procalber you know uh i played baseball with uh with paul on the other end of the 

Recording: (5297/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5298/ 10721) 
believe the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew ised baptism and my grandparents feel and that is the only time they will find me in there you know i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow them now and uh an actually scene any things for what they are and it is frustrating not being able to explain to it to people but that is okay um the law suit uh 

Recording: (5299/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5300/ 10721) 
in his own mind regardless it is part of that bad spirit that people have created the devil not satan to the native people he does not exist in to me another thing that is a bsured but he is real 

Recording: (5301/ 10721) 
um either world playing games 

Recording: (5302/ 10721) 
<laugh> you know you know like you know that the the typical american tourists 

Recording: (5303/ 10721) 
and she did but we were out 

Recording: (5304/ 10721) 
and uh i do not know i think having just having the word honors gives it some kids enough prestige they do not totally freak about it i am not going i deal <laugh> 

Recording: (5305/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5306/ 10721) 
would make any difference or not 

Recording: (5307/ 10721) 
not too far from here 

Recording: (5308/ 10721) 
really i have not noticed that yet hum 

Recording: (5309/ 10721) 
because it was also in the last like a hundred to such a pretty round number 

Recording: (5310/ 10721) 
probably it is you are right i i asked him what language did he have to learn to cook 

Recording: (5311/ 10721) 
then when i found out there was so many openingsings in special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language froms they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not keep process things correctly auditorly so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (5312/ 10721) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form to yeah there is a group and almost be upheaance to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school in his access is the computer or they get in a group of kids where they are parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and 

Recording: (5313/ 10721) 
you know and they work hard you know to make it easier on the students you know they totally rest structured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (5314/ 10721) 
all of that plus by the time you get to first grade you are supposed to have but oh the numbers used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them in order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred you are supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (5315/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5316/ 10721) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (5317/ 10721) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody i got mad somebody you know you they might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred and a some people for no reason 

Recording: (5318/ 10721) 
so family uh humiliity and uh just community i think crime i think is going aup and traffic is run but they want but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is spending so much that we need to 

Recording: (5319/ 10721) 
yeah <laugh> ooh and um um you know at the time i was like i am not going to get anything out of this and it was misery and uh what not but i have met people that have been in much worse situations and at least i can kind of relate to them 

Recording: (5320/ 10721) 
uh you know just always just active and he is always been very active in sports but when i put him on the and he was um laying on the couch you know just zombiey to 

Recording: (5321/ 10721)

Recording: (5322/ 10721) 
to melt in soft and the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire cap for a long period huh it will be hotter than any kind of fire you have ever touched or been around and then far our it is sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down 

Recording: (5323/ 10721)

Recording: (5324/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (5325/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5326/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5327/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (5328/ 10721) 
oh yeah and and i i probably step on your toes here but i i am not a firm believer if mom and dad both working i my wife works until we had children then she stayed home and once they got in in to school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was at home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself or reading okay there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you 

Recording: (5329/ 10721)

Recording: (5340/ 10721) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in the neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it

Recording: (5402/ 10721) 
yeah much too fast for me uh uh 

Recording: (5403/ 10721) 
yeah that is what it is the marketing thing 

Recording: (5404/ 10721) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (5405/ 10721) 
there were things out there was nothing like what they have today you know the small little handguns and things like that that are real easy carryable and considerable i mean like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things like that i mean i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (5406/ 10721)

umhum 

Recording: (5410/ 10721) 
but you can also you can also grow with respect you can work with a community and still gain your respect from community and you will have religions but you know now these we do not have a lot of liability at all it is out the window and that is why i feel the most you are seeing the other day hey yeah big deal you are going out the way you are not well maybe some people are not oh cause the only service okay no disposable that is a problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to commute it 

Recording: (5411/ 10721)

yeah 

Recording: (5414/ 10721) 
most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked uh yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail now on the street so anymore so they do not have to catch them and like the process um et cetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really 

Recording: (5415/ 10721)

Recording: (5464/ 10721) 
i mean there is always been the nerves and uh i do not know when i was growing up in the seventies there really was not punk or anything like that and i think uh unfortunately i mean there is always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they have just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i watch all these shows day line and 2020 all those reforming on shows 

Recording: (5465/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5466/ 10721) 
yeah that 

Recording: (5467/ 10721) 
i do not know i had not thought about that uh just in the value sense or anything to do with what they are doing in the school 

Recording: (5468/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5469/ 10721) 
not gonna make as much money the people are gonna say gee i am not going to them uh in the other words play themselves they gonna get back to weaknesses in our standards in society we we care less about anybody else we do not hey if i have problems the government is going to help me out that is a mind set that is been transferred for forty some years it is a mind set that you talk to the older sometimes that is uh we would never had in our lifetime it is a rural national country and if you were old enough to remember cruise ship i believe cruise ship is 

Recording: (5470/ 10721) 
umhum i did 

Recording: (5471/ 10721) 
to be getting them in <laugh> yep um group in up arlington not far yeah really those five miles mixed because i yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (5472/ 10721) 
but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide education so maybe rough in like my high school they they put up cameras and they like they lock bathrooms like at certain times you can go in on it was getting and they had like we were on the front page to actually i can be comfortable because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dog is threw and they found i 

Recording: (5473/ 10721) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help 

Recording: (5474/ 10721) 
yeah i mean but i mean uh we are not in a depression and and you know the employment rate is fine and health cares we have got some improvements there and like i said that it is hm you know but i just i mean so i was not saying he is done a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time sing on other things and looking at all the money that we wasted the money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5475/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5477/ 10721) 
we laughed about it and i let her um i let her stupid <laugh> because i just decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5478/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5479/ 10721) 
um he was in so much trouble and he was that was the main reason why i did not stay with him was he was just draining on me and pulling me down so he was never really there he was in and and i would go through the whole um child bureau child support that whole thing and that was a total mess you know the way through all the time to go down there to court appearance and all this other step well it turned out he could just move 

Recording: (5480/ 10721) 
yeah yeah that the worst part they are a lot they get really double they took our neighbor is in the sixth grade and they took a whoa elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade 

Recording: (5481/ 10721) 
a couple or three times too but on the phone and everything and then i sit there said well i am in the you know you can call me every name in a book to whatever heck you want to but i am scared of my other so 

Recording: (5482/ 10721) 
it was adjusting on us and we could not we did not catch on to where it was right away but by the time we started looking for h <laugh> which were not deep enough we realized that he was in a clump of of cactus 

Recording: (5483/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (5484/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5485/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5486/ 10721) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age is not they would be adopting them they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (5487/ 10721) 
eighty so we just uh we just sat around our love and twenty university yeah 

Recording: (5488/ 10721) 
with oh being with them 

Recording: (5489/ 10721) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial financial world has come up and everything else the way cost of living has increased at almost they two parents in that homes you want to really live a half way decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live in only have to be able to just use like you said all i have the necessities 

Recording: (5490/ 10721) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but uh they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (5491/ 10721) 
and columbine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but uh what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not 

Recording: (5492/ 10721) 
today society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would talking talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing and that our uh early life uh we did not even know what a nickel or a dime was uh those uh that was unimportant and we also were talking about how uh how we uh went i i he was telling me a little bit by the said let me stop your paw i said paul what 

Recording: (5493/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5494/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5495/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5496/ 10721) 
and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three or four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (5497/ 10721) 
umhum right 

Recording: (5498/ 10721) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is driving force by of our of our government and and even like because without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations they could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they become fairly powerful but i do not think that is absolutely a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because 

Recording: (5499/ 10721) 
umhum personal versus universals on the communications and uh and oh dear and oh this is not over here but whether we are in this universal or no war back here whether your first world is appropriate uh johnos this year yes he has not the same as opposed to janeos as over here all in the personal you can do them this person right over here they can you know they are not going to be out of the third they should not be back to the second house they should not even remember those uh <laugh>

Recording: (5539/ 10721) 
less dare uh part of it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so that is probably one of the biggest problems they had but uh

Recording: (5570/ 10721) 
no right person they are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (5571/ 10721)

vandalism yourself serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases they have been changing up in beach in public for it um i think not to sound too ventual but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it uh i think just the fact that the elves are so overcrowded now that they know that they can get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you know you are not even going to get thirty days in jail and you know 

Recording: (5666/ 10721)

well he he is yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum just like he taught seventh grade they gave him math science um supposedly social the studies all the stuff that i mean it was just it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids i did not know if you heard that they he had not bought them books and so we had to buy them and uh i mean they got reimbursed but yep

yeah she did that yesterday 

Recording: (5782/ 10721) 
a cleanest position on it well he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hope that it would drop and i mean it went which you are hearing again is that everybody has not changed much uh and that but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready is some level to accept but in case in the military it is one thing but then people are talking about getting rid of each person 

Recording: (5783/ 10721) 
get the lady was an astrofoam in she was claustrophinia in her mouth and he could not breath and breath and all this sand and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native saramony shows is how native american spirit quality should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh whoai religion that is out there native americans all they ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantum 

Recording: (5784/ 10721) 
i mean it goes back more towards a curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5785/ 10721) 
that should not be on the other hand i hate to see a thirteen year old have a baby because you are afraid yeah 

Recording: (5786/ 10721)

Recording: (5787/ 10721) 
and uh i just told them what i have to do with my belief system say air of violation on the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me yeah so i just decided uh since they were not going to change those it is going to leave them but so it is you know it is it is a hard way it is just uh walk uh if you are an idealistic person it is i mean just in yourself 

Recording: (5788/ 10721)

i have been going to say loud enough that you have the right to why we have never called the right you know i have never called it lately to make the phone call and if they can convince them and the for a policeman can i think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything they said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and then yet they they have got that thing in the lot they are illegal so they are right you can not tape them on them so you would like if we signed a paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are

Recording: (5850/ 10721)

Recording: (5861/ 10721) 
um going out my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs and so i have always been registered in the food industry but more so ploting of the parties and deciding you know what the clients need are and uh i really like working in that aspect with you know nice shops and really creative food um it is nice because every basically every job is usually different um i am doing a function tonight for three hundred people 

Recording: (5862/ 10721)

Recording: (5864/ 10721) 
<laugh> right 

Recording: (5865/ 10721) 
but what what does it tell us about our people we are so naive we have got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that could be or ben official and most of the time it is listening 

Recording: (5866/ 10721) 
yeah it just but i can not understand is some people live in up for arlington and some of them get to private school

Recording: (5872/ 10721) 
n mass communication to everybody with <laugh> other personal communications that is the key my opinion personal versus international community ocations and and it is zero over here and we are almost a hundred percent over here but when we are in this other personal or global or massive whatever term is almost a john doe who speak here he has an the famous idea of who jane doe is over here 

Recording: (5873/ 10721) 
it is gotten to the point where there is there is more than five million outside 

Recording: (5874/ 10721) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world is nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think i you know i i mean yeah they should not be they should not and she does not spend six weeks on abortion <laugh> or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant uh but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing 

Recording: (5875/ 10721) 
<laugh>

Recording: (5889/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (5890/ 10721) 
all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really goes back to that and what can we do to change it i think as i said it basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person and what is good for everybody not just me me me 

Recording: (5891/ 10721) 
i i i do not think it is necessarily that i think it just comes back to the lack of selfdiscipline 

Recording: (5892/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (5893/ 10721)

<laugh> 

Recording: (6071/ 10721) 
well and it is not just in the schools it is in society uh the environment seems to be an answer to a lot of things and uh it is yeah i just can not it it is hard to imagine that there is an easy fix or there is a fix i do not know it is kind of frustrating because you can not point to one the thing is say this is what needs to be fixed again this pervasive uh it is like the i do not know if you heard about this and then this woman too woman around me in an argument one 

Recording: (6072/ 10721)

Recording: (6077/ 10721) 
she said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was award i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a best of u was 

Recording: (6078/ 10721) 
yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff and like i do not know i do 

Recording: (6079/ 10721) 
right and just going over it and over it and over it 

Recording: (6080/ 10721) 
not necessarily but you know i would like it to be the candidate 

Recording: (6081/ 10721) 
so it is like each neighborhood is got a little different personality 

Recording: (6082/ 10721) 
that goes to a better home 

Recording: (6083/ 10721) 
we want to clean or anything they would probably say you know they might think it was kind of weird but they would let you you know but they would be like you want to do this and we do not have any the money to pay you oh but we do not you know we do not want money that is the whole point where 

Recording: (6084/ 10721) 
my wife was a uh very conscientious hard working woman she established a sector oh business they started all right at home for several years and uh anything that went down to there was right uh i mean <laugh> and uh she does well quite a lot of giving for students over here graduating students 

Recording: (6085/ 10721) 
oh that was some monica lewis 

Recording: (6086/ 10721) 
yeah yeah she is been known to do that too yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (6087/ 10721) 
no that 

Recording: (6088/ 10721) 
they are doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided i would take the easy room 

Recording: (6089/ 10721) 
in example in in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took john between algebra you would think you know i he is teaching in and out in your book when i got to jump and i thought why am i taking this the way they were teaching it now and they are reteaching it entirely different now and and i think linda explain to how they were doing with matthews that she could not even help him um see you know it in the same way of politics it people people 

Recording: (6090/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6091/ 10721) 
and so much from whatever and then you would tell them and then you know on the same turn they would just sort of like snake and be like oh you are not whatever of this european thing you are you know oh sort of 

Recording: (6092/ 10721) 
and uh where my mom was a a young high school student <laugh> just graduating from high school and so they got together there moved to california <laugh> 

Recording: (6093/ 10721) 
<laugh> he is got this thing like thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all 

Recording: (6094/ 10721) 
oh you get you know you are kidding me if you know well that is 

Recording: (6095/ 10721) 
yeah that could really bite you in the back though when you are all that money i would be well i would be quite consent with one million dollars but ten well maybe a couple of people yeah 

Recording: (6096/ 10721) 
yeah when i first went to auburn i was a performance major in the french horn and looking back on it i wished i would maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and uh although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh 

Recording: (6097/ 10721) 
so i am kind of doing that and then i figure i am probably going to wait able to night <laugh> and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (6098/ 10721) 
because that is like me i watch the three stages and you do not see me putting a crew bar up nobody is knows 

Recording: (6099/ 10721) 
now i i um have very little contact with them and so that would be about the last thing i need to learn okay where are we 

Recording: (6100/ 10721) 
yeah i am like uh keyboard and like the phone and you put it on the head set and enough and i know i okay i mean people call in and um 

Recording: (6101/ 10721) 
um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see see over there that prevents it you know they are a sort of from the little line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is you know seventy five pounds you know it like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them in limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but you know really if you buy that 

Recording: (6102/ 10721) 
no <laugh> 

Recording: (6103/ 10721) 
yeah we have that many animals you know people

Recording: (6109/ 10721) 
the wrong more so road 

Recording: (6110/ 10721) 
oh yeah fine now i comes back to your statement what do they tell us we need well now what you need you need a refrigerator you need frost free you need all these things and you know what you go down the street see them at garage sales you have and then you ask people why did you buy them oh we thought we needed them 

Recording: (6111/ 10721) 
yeah yeah and her authority figures at all you know she is she is really strong about that though because um she does not look at anybody being uh you know maybe more wise or we experienced and things but you know certainly should not trust anybody 

Recording: (6112/ 10721) 
not 

Recording: (6113/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6114/ 10721) 
umhum ten thousand dollars fine <laugh> oh man talk about cutting the coupon there i mean

Recording: (6121/ 10721) 
i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it i feel that i have it distinct they just uh a very clear there is a boil between what is uh back in what a friction what is true and was a magicary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references 

Recording: (6122/ 10721) 
um yum uh lordy um grew up on the way side i went to my husband went to um approximately wise probably within a mile of each other where we were kind of high school three hearts and the whole bit um his dad still lives in griff city my mom was still at our or the only house there on the west side and we moved um off the on the way side probably a couple miles from my mom

caring parent you know maybe not even one of the parents you know they might have a foster family or you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there is a lot of the people that that are boster families that only want the money you know and and there is all that so it is it is really scary and i think i think that it has something has to be done real fast i do not know what i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh 

Recording: (6126/ 10721) 
people and that is very hard to negotiate for anybody you know when you are talking raises and lots of money like this what is what they were going for and the majority of the people in this ght trades are not real big participating in the union you know we just ride along and from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here is it seems that that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longer you know and 

Recording: (6127/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6128/ 10721)

umhum diversity 

Recording: (6421/ 10721) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken need to appreciate you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just a it is really not that hard 

Recording: (6422/ 10721) 
umhum umhum yeah but those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although our conductor tries hard to make it interest for orchestra members by bringing in some music that that is interesting challenging or whatever for orchestra he um and we are lucky to have him he is he is a associate conductor for the uh columbus symphony um 

Recording: (6423/ 10721) 
well i can not they fake ours to make it easier for us to understand but you know but not usually there is no problem the only problem usually you have it the like somebody like yourself who had never flown and it is taking lessons and you have you have about ten or fifteen hours and we tell you to do something and you like um well i think i know what the means all just keep flying in it that is the worse thing you can do the best thing can do is say okay i heard what you said but i am brand new at this and i have got no idea what you mean can you try it again and they will go okay 

Recording: (6424/ 10721) 
i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but you know but it is not uh uh i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university anyway yeah 

Recording: (6425/ 10721) 
yeah we are getting in patient and we are getting um it it is sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now although the old be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are we are really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say my friends i say teach these kids well because they are gonna be 

Recording: (6426/ 10721) 
but historically you know women were not you know it was a man is field and and you know even women who were doing it and doing it well did not get the attention did not get

now over by north broadway as i said 

Recording: (6428/ 10721) 
yeah but uh just to see the church might be fun uh we about how many years it goes seven or eight yeah because we were really too too big for the hum 

Recording: (6429/ 10721) 
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and 

Recording: (6430/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (6431/ 10721) 
a drive and the only problem she has she did not have a job to supporting herself other than that she could have taken care of herself but she she uses to be still at home and be a part out of our life and uh my son he is both of us kids have four points i mean they are really worth garden school because they know it is important and my son was uh he was the only only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the mature that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i am really 

Recording: (6432/ 10721) 
oh really uh it is like oh milk and swisslers 

Recording: (6433/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6434/ 10721)

Recording: (6437/ 10721) 
someselves had flaws and that costs her better drama so i like that do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it is something that would be even grittyier they they had the potential for for excellent character conflict but they gloss over all those immediately was in the first season uh and that really bothered me and then it ultimately it ultimately like they are trapped 

Recording: (6438/ 10721) 
and it my husband sometimes i mean we have taken jury out to the military a few times to go to the grape side of his mother and he says you know very often boy she would really have liked to have been here and done things with him

Recording: (6441/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6442/ 10721) 
oh yeah it is so much better than having an alley or sitting or on your deck and looking your house the neighbors right behind you you are staying at them sitting on their deck we have got old woods and a creek and in the golf course uh so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside two seventy still so 

Recording: (6443/ 10721)

Recording: (6449/ 10721) 
you know that access is just there is almost nothing hard and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of yeah and onversation talking about oh yeah you know getting it gotten for security and all this stuff it is like you know year chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know half in chance that you

Recording: (6679/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6680/ 10721) 
uh where we put all kinds of information out on our own web site which is very hard to find what you want you know it is that is a some problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it uh it it get is a problem for us for the library is because there is just a barage of what they are getting and it is not just from us it is from the literature uh there is 

Recording: (6681/ 10721) 
uh i was in the cub scouts 

Recording: (6682/ 10721)

Recording: (6688/ 10721) 
yeah that they all get the option but i i understand very few exercise it so you know if they were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are using and then giving the two dollars an hour you know but then that could then you could say that always use helping to keep people down and so you have to still it is it is the odd balance there it is and like something like that does not seem too skilled to me so i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but 

Recording: (6689/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6690/ 10721) 
anything that is more just a family preference i i prefer family uh

Recording: (6770/ 10721) 
i think so he is he is not being forced to go in any direction that he is not ready for yeah i was going to college and and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so oh he was very independent but i am not sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adopting to his environment and where he was put

Recording: (6779/ 10721) 
i mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and they able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tech paper corner not a big real to real thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalogs funny enough that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh library of congress has it oh just to write about

Recording: (6787/ 10721) 
you could but you could take it 

Recording: (6788/ 10721) 
yeah and i said i think the freshman class just right along i think the freshmen would be a little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to beat walking around you know in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million holes around me and just up once and i said there was less and beat in the that way that is too far from our part 

Recording: (6789/ 10721)

Recording: (6791/ 10721) 
come on you know people i do not know i would hate to be in the predicament of having to change anything because it would be hard to change from one group and on another 

Recording: (6792/ 10721) 
um probably would have been about six years ago i mean in six or seventh grade

<laugh> 

Recording: (6799/ 10721) 
i do not know um like i said i mean it something that i basically see it almost as being the same thing it is like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tar into things like that but as far as what it in effect it does to you it is no worst than anything alcohol can do to you um so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if they should actually go as far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time and 

Recording: (6800/ 10721) 
yeah his mom could not take care of him anymore and he was like i think he is about fourteen and he just he he you know have really anywhere to go and luckily this families had taken his different siblings different families took them i do not know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families took care of them but um it was good for them because he is got that example

yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (6803/ 10721) 
umhum yeah yeah it is being glamorousized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and that is seeing somebody gets shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something out with you and looks at you know it was not real and i do not think they i think 

Recording: (6804/ 10721)

<laugh> i 

Recording: (6820/ 10721) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because your black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean at the same thing with like i heard people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from them 

Recording: (6821/ 10721)

Recording: (6849/ 10721) 
anymore and you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down in the pieces or teaching a different way it is like teaching them ask problem if you get the same answer but one way works better for you and well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn while by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing

Recording: (6938/ 10721) 
um well i have had the house excuse me um for probably six or seven years and we just need to move it is kind of small it is a smaller house and uh my husband works in gahina so we were going to look for some houses up that way and maybe some land we have been looking at some land up north too 

Recording: (6939/ 10721) 
no they were from all over the world i had um one companion who was from russia but she was on a temporary mission i mostly all over america but but there was a girl from mongolian uh there was girls there who i never was companions with them but they were from russia different there was a girl from moscow um my mission president was actually from saint peter isburg and his wife they they did not speak english at all 

Recording: (6940/ 10721) 
oh i was a little bit on the test side yeah i 

Recording: (6941/ 10721) 
um one of their requirements is we have to be in the oner is college during undergraduate really before still all their requirements there 

Recording: (6942/ 10721) 
like they see them what was going through their heads you know but that is something we have never now 

Recording: (6943/ 10721) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade in the last they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are gonna have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know oh i am going to play in a rock band uh you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drummer and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life 

Recording: (6944/ 10721) 
um about yeah the weekenders we have had her for two years yeah we did about six months we went to hawaii and got his brother married and then when we came back we need to that would be the last long trip um we were going to wait till this spring but we could not so we went to rescue service and got our 

Recording: (6945/ 10721) 
would have been a lot better i think for myself for and everything you know i mean for you know if we would have been able to had uh john casty with her and everything you know which he was growing up because by her being out there i mean you know you can just imagine she is you know been being a girl not saying girl in any bad about girl or being my daughter you know boring about things in school weekends and stuff like that so where my wife is a closer tour

Recording: (6950/ 10721) 
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting behind 

Recording: (6951/ 10721) 
think that i do not think that is going to ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think this so cold divorce rate program as i talked about a while ago like uh every or fifty percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

Recording: (6952/ 10721) 
i mean there is nothing bad about them or anything that they 

Recording: (6953/ 10721) 
ruther gym

Recording: (6980/ 10721) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirit you know they are people in terms of someone said they eyes the mirror did not solve that is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings 

Recording: (6981/ 10721) 
oh they always give it the first i am i do not want a thirty six years old 

Recording: (6982/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6983/ 10721)

Recording: (6984/ 10721) 
oh yeah um we just do not really talk about that very often and i am just 

Recording: (6985/ 10721) 
nobody really admits it but oh i grab the paper because i want to see what the agreement was and it is pretty much the same thing and they are looting positively for it this time 

Recording: (6986/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6987/ 10721) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not too on that 

Recording: (6988/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (6989/ 10721) 
and outside of english french is a horriblely popular language for different countries to have the second language so i think it would be extraordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french 

Recording: (6990/ 10721) 
that is true 

Recording: (6991/ 10721) 
oh i said the gun and well obviously that is not true you know uh my personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms uh if you are of the legal way and everything i am not really sure the background checks really do that gradeable job 

Recording: (6992/ 10721) 
so i guess you i mean that one well that was really really hard for me i will just call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crime spell but he did go to that where he just then got quick crime 

Recording: (6993/ 10721) 
and they fly checks like if you run a check today and you deposit it at the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearing house and that is all they do all night long

Recording: (6995/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6996/ 10721)

Recording: (6997/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (6998/ 10721) 
china we just had a van who took time to

Recording: (7002/ 10721) 
i do not think you read about it for it myself but uh it is interesting uh uh you know when they when they first one day uh we are time began you know of course in life uh what i believe and then everything you know is man on one and got married you know and the reason they got married is because of proag byation you know keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so 

Recording: (7003/ 10721)

oh see 

Recording: (7015/ 10721)

Recording: (7018/ 10721)

oh they are very good they call i usually just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there the subject ready 

Recording: (7020/ 10721) 
and there were people that were opposed to the wild light refugees mostly people that live there near their farmers and but it seems like the one thing that almost everybody there agreed  gone was they did not want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments and uh that we somebody was talking there about the difference between development here in the united states and in europe uh and how development in in europe tends to 

Recording: (7021/ 10721) 
right and you know all the babies in the hospital become under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not going to be very big 

Recording: (7022/ 10721) 
and a lot of them have been getting off the hook lately you see this guy on uh hard copy he kills this woman is husband because he is in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly capable of making his own decisions now i think that there is there is uh things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide yeah 

Recording: (7023/ 10721) 
i i like to talk about columbus <laugh> 

Recording: (7024/ 10721)

Recording: (7028/ 10721) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am a reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial infoluents upon the political uh influence that it it is almost a four gone conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or in the in the next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (7029/ 10721) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (7030/ 10721) 
i can have a gun i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an in you mean now that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that cut and dried um yeah that would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit 

Recording: (7031/ 10721) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did but that is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to and just doing he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he wrote a lot and 

Recording: (7032/ 10721) 
whereas i do not know luther and it is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (7033/ 10721) 
big bulver do they have like little babies that are in their ouches like kinga is 

Recording: (7034/ 10721) 
we do not know who is in the airplane and there there are c planes that do come in out of there 

Recording: (7035/ 10721) 
and i think allmanah uh well i really like the rising military because it says discipline responsibility respect for you go to a what columbus public school and the kids will last out on substitute teachers i think it is really crazy um i think you should have a lot more respect for your elders your adult 

Recording: (7036/ 10721) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh they kentucky and maryland color broadado all their school shootings and can not believe in i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (7037/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7038/ 10721) 
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where you are going to put it 

Recording: (7039/ 10721) 
um that uh well well i knew about the girl of up <laugh> and uh you know i it is uh a women is organization uh to promote women artists and and to uh object to the to the male high a working you know that only only men get are in the museums and only men get the big gallery shows and stuff like that 

Recording: (7040/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7041/ 10721) 
you like the university level 

Recording: (7042/ 10721) 
you look forward to coming home you know and the pet is waiting on you 

Recording: (7043/ 10721) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying attention a lot you know like i read this about every day and i read usd from a economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (7044/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7045/ 10721) 
you know what i mean you can not do this you can not do that 

Recording: (7046/ 10721) 
and i always understood each of the noise to stop playing so my father and i i am going to start getting phone calls here in a little bit i will just push the phone so my father and i you know we spend the third time on the street each other much better than my mother and i did um we were able to communicate in uh very similar fashions we did not agree and in fact i probably a more bea and so 

Recording: (7047/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7048/ 10721) 
and i do not know whether i am not i do not think the second sister ever went to school out there but uh they used worse tough but and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and uh got her teacher is certificate so i guess in they would agree that if they could find someone to they would ask answer to 

Recording: (7049/ 10721) 
so um there is from what i hear one of the experienced kids was in a car with a drunk person had quite an experience with it 

Recording: (7050/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7051/ 10721) 
there is too much information and too much change uh library is that this is against probably what the image of library is that they are very very eager to impress change uh internet came out and you know when it and when it got out of the area it was being used by universities or whatever for research that sort of was at first my brain are right there and they one in more and more and they one in figure out what they can do with it uh with pcs yeah we 

Recording: (7052/ 10721) 
that is where my father is from 

Recording: (7053/ 10721) 
but the last majority of engineers i like math and science so i figured well engineering i do not have any other options i must be engineering so i came to college and i got into the honey engineering freshman the freshman engineering program called the getway program engineering is the hardest field to study so i am probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really 

Recording: (7054/ 10721) 
no no it does not 

Recording: (7055/ 10721) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral belief if and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his he said his dad told him about condom is you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus

Recording: (7090/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7091/ 10721) 
when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and as an under current it was not a very good in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion and very a vice issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divisions them you know it it is ainly almost like in vietnam almost 

Recording: (7092/ 10721)

like this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scary here back in like ninety four ninety five then uh i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent s successful the the opposition is criticize the advance 

Recording: (7326/ 10721)

in the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scramled somehow and i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you probably have a lot of apathy for them 

Recording: (7336/ 10721) 
duff right 

Recording: (7337/ 10721) 
like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or catch school and stuff uh <laugh>

little league and you know uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad shock boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people got this  schools were so bad they said we are not going to support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite check we went in and we said you know eighteen months later on the board put another they are um about uh the levy on the the ballet we said these are great school we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement

Recording: (7340/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7341/ 10721) 
i was going to say i i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to be at home and the husband support him in the the situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is out alimony and all that kind of thing and that can be if you can never go out and have another life or have it on their wife and you know 

Recording: (7342/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7343/ 10721) 
that is what we figure in a few years they will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean as kind of as we did not know where he was for a week or a time uh a week at a time here i just drive in the main avenue once and so i am bagging money on the street and that is it is it is pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (7344/ 10721) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (7345/ 10721) 
no that is not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that but a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (7346/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7347/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7348/ 10721) 
uh so she does not want to take the baby home so they are arranging some other things we have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time but what do you think of it is gonna be too hard for us 

Recording: (7349/ 10721) 
well and do not you think too the that the more they have found out psychological speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the uh throws of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the that experience from being one of eleven children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (7350/ 10721) 
and there is people who are like that today still you know but i think people should go to uh retirement centers uh uh and uh sit down and make a visit to them every week make a part of their life and give up a friendship 

Recording: (7351/ 10721) 
white and breck 

Recording: (7352/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7353/ 10721) 
you know because i just think it looks so often when you can not you can not even admit to what you what your opinion is 

Recording: (7354/ 10721) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could fill me crawling out the door as an oil issue employee 

Recording: (7355/ 10721) 
years ago there was a citizen i do not know if you ever in you or what is your background is where you were it was here but you are not but citizen journal was the daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the respect was much more liberal they used this it it was a morning paper in the past was an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same pretty many pressing and everything and then to spatch one of their lease experimented one and three new at least 

Recording: (7356/ 10721) 
uh she is real good yeah yeah everything is healthy and great um she and then my daughter i mean i think she is just going to be real good influence she is i think oh mom and um the father is in another relationship and probably on his way to beginning married and you know it does not look like he is going to be in the picture that much and she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him to be too so because you 

Recording: (7357/ 10721) 
<laugh> yeah you should be we are all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (7358/ 10721) 
yep 

Recording: (7359/ 10721)

Recording: (7360/ 10721) 
because somebody has totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and she is going to go she she is going to quit her job and go to um uh um working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him

his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed no that is not necessarily his opinion is what i am trying to make a point there <laugh> he would sway them basically upon the influences that he had had from uh uh various people within this community whether whether you are talking about a town ship or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then 

Recording: (7393/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7394/ 10721)

Recording: (7400/ 10721) 
yeah years ago because it was something well it was right there worth with with a lot of people population and everything and then like i say if you know if you got basically the people moving and uh to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff you know that is they are moving away from us they are still getting into it but uh the just their perspective huh uh then you you talk to if you build it they will come they say you know so umhum umhum 

Recording: (7401/ 10721) 
even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university they do not i am you do not hear them any like whole like universal negative things about this about the university you ever

Recording: (7408/ 10721) 
um currently unemployed umhum 

Recording: (7409/ 10721) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college vacation uh but like a trade or a skill or something that will give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of right i mean to bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up on their head okay i can either go become a welder or 

Recording: (7410/ 10721) 
uh well i paid for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we would wait till the sarge went in the shed and we would just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out

Recording: (7413/ 10721) 
yeah <laugh> can not really take it with you <laugh> yeah you can not get her in <laugh> you can not get her in it would be eighteen any to get into dance clubs now but um that is uh those are the two really really really tough ones that a lot of people will will well 

Recording: (7414/ 10721) 
oh george oh tell me i do not know i have not really formed an opinion i can not 

Recording: (7415/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7416/ 10721) 
but obviously you would try to stair them more in whichever direction they are most suited for you know as far as far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much fun on tearing to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you would think that you can you know there is something you know hopefully that i do not know 

Recording: (7417/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7418/ 10721) 
couple restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you got to hang out but here it is like campus and he or more of uh 

Recording: (7419/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7420/ 10721) 
that way at least we could move around a little bit but uh 

Recording: (7421/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (7422/ 10721) 
umhum have a few ideas um i am thinking i might be know be too and 

Recording: (7423/ 10721) 
 main campus the same 

Recording: (7424/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7425/ 10721) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (7426/ 10721) 
but of course whenever they need it or right or anything i got a chance home of the men 

Recording: (7427/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7428/ 10721) 
developing things as they accommodate to our own selfish beans not to the sacrifice of what we should be doing and we are all oh more too long more i will go on be in that and i am not saying no one makes those errors makes errors it is always there the problem is just trying to stay focused on that not a jump ship you know you are seeing this country oh you do not like leaving 

Recording: (7429/ 10721) 
and they do not wear like the lot of the way in shirts and and you know the shorts and the camera is that that they do they do they say they um do they 

Recording: (7430/ 10721)

Recording: (7453/ 10721)

Recording: (7468/ 10721) 
oh god 

Recording: (7469/ 10721)

Recording: (7470/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7471/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7472/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7473/ 10721) 
i did i did 

Recording: (7474/ 10721) 
but maybe if it if it would have stayed small maybe maybe i could notice some kind of difference that way but but i i never i have not noticed anything 

Recording: (7475/ 10721) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy becausey i have a 

Recording: (7476/ 10721) 
all of them can order their house to they get bored to a book in the book now they will go back book occasional to start looking for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent and however my one son is going to do it he is got one room she is going to be lying with books and a hall way part of his just book i do not know if those kids ever go to the big those up or not because roys do not i believe so you see it is what is taught at home that really counts but we do not need all those material things and i am sitting back and thinking well which 

Recording: (7477/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7478/ 10721) 
what do i want out of life 

Recording: (7479/ 10721)

Recording: (7487/ 10721)

Recording: (7488/ 10721) 
their day care oh i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of day care offered it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice a cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a toss up it is a real

oh 

Recording: (7490/ 10721) 
have only she had <laugh> then i told her but was me completely alone i would be in the middle of the city somewhere you know where you see people and i do not know you know it is just you can always see what someone else should do or could do or whatever

Recording: (7573/ 10721) 
to get them to do what they do to even to help like mind people or to uh help people that have other physical disabilities um you you can tell from the way the dog is in terms of uh with with the way the dog behave with the person that has the disability on that they have been trained for um you can tell whether they have been trained or trained the right way or whatever so

Recording: (7726/ 10721) 
just really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values but but good values i do not look at any whether they are older do good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that uh devoted it spruly for this so that those students can 

Recording: (7727/ 10721) 
and i just sit there for a minute before i take it out i take it on out and sit on top of the time and i said well mommy said a bad word i guess that uh mommy has to have that still going to her mouth do not you i get up the soon as we hear about money

Recording: (7735/ 10721) 
no human is or violent by any true believe i mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it it is more or less dreed that causes violence that is not media just like the of the of the to see was an advertisement showing what you could do tv is showing you violence that you could do if you are driven to it 

Recording: (7736/ 10721) 
they will say oh well this sounds is going to be he is two right now that is you know you know changes his so it so it does not come out to be be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (7737/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7738/ 10721) 
yeah but it got out of control 

Recording: (7739/ 10721)

Recording: (7743/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7744/ 10721) 
um this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting it is a lot more practical yeah it is a little more problem solving less right around the shooting things you know um it is like problem solving they you know little puzzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it is you create your own entertainment oh 

Recording: (7745/ 10721) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and uh and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict in friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself when you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we 

Recording: (7746/ 10721) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the anywhere uh even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um

Recording: (7761/ 10721) 
i think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself raises at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things like you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough 

Recording: (7762/ 10721)

umhum yeah 

Recording: (7771/ 10721)

right i think that is pretty neat 

Recording: (7780/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7781/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (7782/ 10721)

Recording: (7786/ 10721) 
short north in the short north but um it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird um you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you got access you do not get hit on my girls you get head on my guys i dance with blue sticks and i have had i had like seven guys come up to him in one night and they are just like can you like can you do that for me

Recording: (7863/ 10721) 
i have no idea i remember where i was too in the collin dine shooting because like my friends and i were sitting around drinking a few beer and you know we were channel <laugh> and you know we see that kid fall for the window and we are like oh my god what is going on so we just left it on and it was quite like it was disturbing because i look i was recent out of high school myself in lake shore they were fighting it was always like you could avoid them or you know what i mean 

Recording: (7864/ 10721) 
um but the little girls sitting there going oh i mean you need to go seven like seven nine times nine sixty three you know per time table and stuff you know so uh yeah i see like younger kids to with kids you know and you know many years no matter what you are wasting you you you screwed up your life you are going to you are also screwed up your kids you know i was twenty well i was thirty one one of them was born so 

Recording: (7865/ 10721) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but uh i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example and we have refer kids in arlington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know is that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve systems or 

Recording: (7866/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7867/ 10721) 
and he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure the situation like that thing is they are gonna come up but we will we will deal with it 

Recording: (7868/ 10721) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am than i do not have a problem with it and i was in the men is league club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are uh that are good as well and that is and and i have really made friends with a lot of them i guess i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not even though i am not wanting 

Recording: (7869/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7870/ 10721) 
that was grade school 

Recording: (7871/ 10721) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be another thing above you know if there is that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (7872/ 10721) 
i got told you i can be an idiot 

Recording: (7873/ 10721) 
so you you pretty much have to be you know it can not be middle class and you know it have got to be you have to be rich or you are not 

Recording: (7874/ 10721) 
but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it is pretty easy i guess pretty straight forward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (7875/ 10721) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called bread and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids and 

Recording: (7876/ 10721)

Recording: (7881/ 10721) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (7882/ 10721)

Recording: (7899/ 10721) 
i do not believe that 

Recording: (7900/ 10721) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they 

Recording: (7901/ 10721)

Recording: (7907/ 10721) 
right right right 

Recording: (7908/ 10721) 
what i liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is right i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (7909/ 10721) 
yeah and just a couple things i remember when i first started going to the unitary church up here on uh well when i was in sunday school we we drove there from reynoldsburg by going up i think reynoldsburg near walley road up to uh more slowed and then over on more slowed to high street so it was it was from the back roads you know <laugh> and that was before the mid sixties 

Recording: (7910/ 10721) 
i do i think they you know if you are open with your kids nowadays you would have to be with everything that is in the world i mean my parents never talk to me about drugs or anything 

Recording: (7911/ 10721)

Recording: (7912/ 10721) 
oh uhhuh 

Recording: (7913/ 10721) 
umhum yeah because i could not imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (7914/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7915/ 10721) 
uh 

Recording: (7916/ 10721)

Recording: (7921/ 10721) 
you know we take them to wild out lake or you know the zoo or all type of things well yeah we have got a the best thing you have got to get a membership to everything that is what we figured out we have got coast to and we got the deal and got wide outlook and that way you can go whenever you want if an hour into the show they are not participating properly you can leave and you you are not out in it <laugh> in it yeah you know that coast that is great we really like that they have really 

Recording: (7922/ 10721) 
uh the reason that it was one of the best years of my life was it is an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate right and that where very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly i am uh i mean your questions and their conversations talk about opinions <laugh> from a 

Recording: (7923/ 10721) 
talk to them like you know this would be nice down um 

Recording: (7924/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7925/ 10721) 
yeah they they will not increase until the tax law revise itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we were just deductions it went down to yeah yeah and then again uh you say well you know like uh maybe some excellent uh person would donate in his public size

Recording: (7927/ 10721) 
yeah my brother is well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones that i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (7928/ 10721) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now uh i think the world would be a lot of place the lot better place and along with the politicians they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public i said what we think to make our ourselves look great 

Recording: (7929/ 10721) 
yeah it is a qualityative type an ounceous 

Recording: (7930/ 10721) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference uh i can not say from what i have seen the people that went cathy schools uh they are a little bit more disciplined and they know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the medicine that they have to do here 

Recording: (7931/ 10721) 
and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when i was about like six years old i think and then they moved up uh to clintonville it is about when i was about eight and now my dad lives in up in clintonville too so 

Recording: (7932/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7933/ 10721) 
i think the news media have typed it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba united states has found it see is immediately turn to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is that is that is the premiseating on uh you know in the news media they have not really been up it is just have not been real objective about it i mean uh you know 

Recording: (7934/ 10721) 
oh i said no i 

Recording: (7935/ 10721) 
i think columbus is really interesting how how it developed compared to uh like i do not know just like how indianapolis like how columbus is different it is it is a or a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and made out compared to like philadelphia you know or just like when it was settled and and when it was made just out like more the streets or more where it is all like planned out more as opposed to like in in phillie where places like that more east coast it is like the roads um parts of them are real small and 

Recording: (7936/ 10721) 
and uh as our our engineers the engineers per se but they are techies uh are really into this they they enjoy their work and it is a poor it in the forefront of ohio government along with the technology there has to always be the paperwork and i know realize we have a peopleous environment um quote unquote 

Recording: (7937/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7938/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7939/ 10721) 
well i lived on twelve maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but that was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couch being burned us that is new 

Recording: (7940/ 10721) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation and they there is probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students 

Recording: (7941/ 10721) 
umhum the yeah 

Recording: (7942/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7943/ 10721) 
but i think it should be an option you know i am really you know for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a oh it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it ultimate ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every especially when you are young little girls should have to go through you know pregnants and everything even if its a mistake or whatever i just you know 

Recording: (7944/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7945/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7946/ 10721) 
and they think those little bunch of people they just do not want to spend any extra money on anything so we are already paying for enough of things you know i do that 

Recording: (7947/ 10721) 
um the first year they made it in state only um second the second class they are going to be starting to house some people from michigan i think 

Recording: (7948/ 10721) 
yeah real bad and and it was you know mainly um no one talked about it

so 

Recording: (7950/ 10721) 
can feed them and i get them so that is our life is mister mom 

Recording: (7951/ 10721) 
well my question is who is more important in the basketball team the fifties or six man coming off the bench ask it ask it ask it ask it ask it ask you ask george reese is he warm is he less important this year than he was last year 

Recording: (7952/ 10721) 
now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (7953/ 10721) 
yeah so and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (7954/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (7955/ 10721) 
it can turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (7956/ 10721) 
you know my favorite character on that show had always been chicoah and i do not like how i do not like how he is are noter has been portrayed in the recent couple of seasons um i like the fact that he was someone who had been a star flight officer and but because of a matter of principle uh left to ourfully join the lockhe but we are still uh fundamentally an honorable person 

Recording: (7957/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (7958/ 10721) 
no what what really um when aids started i had a a one of my best friends a brother had died of it and that and that really after that i like till you know was like i have to work on them because i was scared to death so they get aids you know so i did work on them you know probably after a few years of having sex has out comes but 

Recording: (7959/ 10721) 
to be something that is going to make them change you know what is it you know what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than you know the government saying okay this is your cut off limit but i mean the statistics they 

Recording: (7960/ 10721) 
well yeah me either 

Recording: (7961/ 10721) 
convening <laugh> 

Recording: (7962/ 10721) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (7963/ 10721) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (7964/ 10721) 
um i mean 

Recording: (7965/ 10721) 
see i am a i am a i am a professor i am doing studies here and uh 

Recording: (7966/ 10721) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up as as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (7967/ 10721) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be heeled from things that they could not be heel from uh so everybody today is i mean uh basically as today as our future were back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i was not really thinking about the idea i mean you know i was gonna about tomorrow 

Recording: (7968/ 10721) 
like i know it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (7969/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (7970/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (7971/ 10721) 
okay it does not have like the equalized are thingy 

Recording: (7972/ 10721) 
i will buy herself 

Recording: (7973/ 10721) 
i think i would say the same thing because um of course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her self lessness and uh 

Recording: (7974/ 10721) 
they have uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (7975/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (7976/ 10721) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (7977/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7978/ 10721) 
do it i wanted i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up at picking up that child and cutting it and and having and having uh a baby touch your skin uh and uh uh teaching uh what love is uh uh did you you know especially teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother the little brother and 

Recording: (7979/ 10721) 
oh i think that is good 

Recording: (7980/ 10721) 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you are going to tell me that fall push that two foot pine tree across the way i mean neil is a thick tree too <laugh> and uh we get up to the next gas station he fills up and listen on in that county i turned around and said now see who is this 

Recording: (7981/ 10721) 
i can see that i you know i like i said for me i kind of i could not stay where i am so it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more so i move into ther to affect me personally to me that is bad i do not even sure i feel guilty about that but 

Recording: (7982/ 10721) 
you know will take that as an assault 

Recording: (7983/ 10721) 
i do not even know it just it was just great <laugh> it is just embarrassing 

Recording: (7984/ 10721) 
i think if it is a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which also been to of course then 

Recording: (7985/ 10721) 
may to face their uh their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminalals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (7986/ 10721) 
no really i mean different cultures and everything uh uh i i went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big a thing except prove it and plus of the you know i never in the real age how many were being drafted or being in listening to the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (7987/ 10721) 
see so see i would rather if i were going to buy house than clintonville to hold them and rent them my problem is i do not have any money so i that down payment it has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bevelled road for my kids to live in so my oldest girl when she was getting ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable they will 

Recording: (7988/ 10721)

Recording: (8084/ 10721)

Recording: (8085/ 10721) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but uh if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination any more

Recording: (8087/ 10721) 
oh they were here there are many people that were bad eggs man 

Recording: (8088/ 10721) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only a logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know in that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and education than a lot um you know than most of probably the people that 

Recording: (8089/ 10721) 
or board games but board just anything that you appeal 

Recording: (8090/ 10721) 
yeah it is and it seems to me that they do not keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of uh like just below the absolute best in and it keeps a lot of them here 

Recording: (8091/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8092/ 10721) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago but that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (8093/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8094/ 10721) 
um my sister had gone a couple times and basically took me aside and i have but one siblings and um it is it is fun to have a siblings because nobody is more similar to you than that siblings because they had to deal with the insanity that is your family

Recording: (8106/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8107/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8108/ 10721) 
well i have been at a lot more different cultures seeing how lot more different people lived found out how lucky i was 

Recording: (8109/ 10721) 
they are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (8110/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8111/ 10721) 
he specializes in like so laura is and hbox

Recording: (8113/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8114/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8115/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (8116/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8117/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8118/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8119/ 10721) 
and they perceive to sit i think they set two over guns on the battery i mean the tire is on the fire 

Recording: (8120/ 10721) 
you know she goes dad 

Recording: (8121/ 10721) 
just 

Recording: (8122/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8123/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8124/ 10721) 
well you always hear about the beat again 

Recording: (8125/ 10721) 
yeah i do not <laugh> well that is fair maybe that is true too i mean i do not feel because you know when you are younger you think oh my god twenty seven you must be you know and now that you are here you like us i i felt fun i do not feel like <laugh> we are responsible but i <laugh> 

Recording: (8126/ 10721) 
in high school yeah i have friends with most of them 

Recording: (8127/ 10721) 
at the beginning he did perfectly but now he is doing this i want up at four oclock kind of thing and give him a bottle that goes back to sleep but you know i do not want in a walk around the big bottle for the four oclock they can not see you feel in my way through the hallways and stuff 

Recording: (8128/ 10721) 
so it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (8129/ 10721) 
so but that is you know i ended up selling the attorney got most of the money so little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went out off my medication and uh you know blew it <laugh> you know so that was my responsibility on my phone that uh you know how it was just uh years of tend up frustration and i just 

Recording: (8130/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8131/ 10721) 
so the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (8132/ 10721) 
so that is i think that is a problem too you know everybody says well i do not want to get thirty eight thirty you know so 

Recording: (8133/ 10721) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um yeah i you know i really really struggle with that because i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going to do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um <laugh> it sounds like my dad but it seems like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids yeah 

Recording: (8134/ 10721) 
be really rude not helpful 

Recording: (8135/ 10721) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really function around was nurses getting them from good day care because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before it was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or something in it church when it first started but and uh it is just not you know people are always saying i can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to 

Recording: (8136/ 10721) 
um <laugh> with all i have learned a lot it is been interesting i have liked mcdonald is 

Recording: (8137/ 10721) 
once you are in it you have been in it and that is it i have thirty two points 

Recording: (8138/ 10721) 
about it is a bit much much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me just all the sorts of changes in there things like that going on but other than that i mean i seem to like it i mean it is definitely changes for the better it is a lot more just for you i mean to get to do whatever you on i mean there is no one watching every saying what you have to do all the time and everything like that 

Recording: (8139/ 10721) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they will not allow dogs so <laugh> she is not allowed to go over there so she is always said oh but <laugh> but it does make a big difference i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8140/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8141/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8142/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8143/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8144/ 10721) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for him to try and think of ways to say and just there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate there was a he needs some of this piece of information at the same time there is no way i could tell it to him so yeah <laugh> it is like oh so i am yeah you do not know and there is nothing else to do about it and continue on maryland he i he said eventually he said it was sometime later and i actually found it always going on he said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party count and figure out who is not there and it seems something bad it happened but um but he said but it was a while before 

Recording: (8145/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8146/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8147/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8148/ 10721) 
for him to not make the honoral every time i could not even imagine what was happening with him and now he is completely back on track and doing really well and my eight grade daughter is um she is you know i guess you are involved in all kinds of different things she is real involved in theater uh and she is everything that comes along you know and she wins in science there she gets the power of the pen she is on student count they all have lots of different kinds of things that they are involved in and that i am credit proud of them because they are just 

Recording: (8149/ 10721) 
much in school was that 

Recording: (8150/ 10721) 
sends to what thethous you should be like <laugh> so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour or choir director uh arrangeed it to about six or five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we like the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church oh he is um he is um he is um you know they uh they uh that is one thing you know they uh that is one thing you know they uh that is one thing you know they uh that is that is that 

Recording: (8151/ 10721) 
yeah it is a good growing area the job prospects or uh little scares you know because of the smaller town but yeah there is only about a one percent unemployment rate there 

Recording: (8152/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8153/ 10721) 
most of the trouble i have uh i got one neighbor that hatesates me in his is share 

Recording: (8154/ 10721) 
no huh 

Recording: (8155/ 10721) 
um my two eleven together things like that 

Recording: (8156/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8157/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (8158/ 10721) 
uh that is right well they do not they do not they do not give them uh i do not know maybe they give each one one free ticket or something the rest of them have to pay <laugh> 

Recording: (8159/ 10721) 
i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and the teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring a crowd where the kids ask and said do you and he is ever going to home so no no we have them but they are always there they are not there just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are there after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy 

Recording: (8160/ 10721) 
that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that just shocks fast people go nuts people would rather see a tight game it was like seven to like shake other than much like uh a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8161/ 10721) 
neither was i i really was not and uh it is funny i just this summer went to my twenty fifth uh high school reunion 

Recording: (8162/ 10721) 
hum how would you up in ohio 

Recording: (8163/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8164/ 10721) 
i do not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations and i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what oh the kids are being in uh show on and and have access to 

Recording: (8165/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8166/ 10721)

get into school and they get violent and they they take it out uh you know and everybody is surprised you know i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and um and going to school it is going to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different background and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they they are not going to have one 

Recording: (8576/ 10721)

exactly but i do there there is the other side um that uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from it well not exactly your giving up your children and and then something has to be done but but there is also there is also that that i i mean i think it is probably the legitimate fear that children uh children of that group are going to you know going to be a lot ofized out of out of their heritage 

Recording: (8594/ 10721) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (8595/ 10721)

Recording: (8600/ 10721) 
yeah you just find it i do anything i want it yeah 

Recording: (8601/ 10721) 
and and it am going to hold you to this confidently because very few people know about this 

Recording: (8602/ 10721) 
yeah but the same time every day yeah 

Recording: (8603/ 10721) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (8604/ 10721)

Recording: (8607/ 10721) 
yeah that is interesting though because i think i think that that my whole i i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (8608/ 10721) 
for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be real interesting and help me feel like you know helping people um they give uh new directions for abused uh wives and mothers and uh help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that 

Recording: (8609/ 10721) 
right down 

Recording: (8610/ 10721) 
can not can not believe it i do not i i you know i that that just that just blows my money you can spend on thousands of dollars just for a wedding

Recording: (8614/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8615/ 10721) 
yeah i mean you know <laugh> signing oh here you are going um the one i think is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that should not happen and the other one about yeah you just let us face it at that age and at every age we want to lead her um and i guess it goes back if we choose to or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we will make better decisions of who is going to lead 

Recording: (8616/ 10721) 
<laugh> whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple of years if you do not go in that area yeah and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up that is all and three fifteen door things like that 

Recording: (8617/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8618/ 10721) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know oh which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (8619/ 10721) 
oh i so um whoa christian i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got it in my hand that i did not want anybody to caught to see how your dad doing and so the best way to do with that situation was to callgloably across the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go because how often did you get to tell people <laugh> in the united states going themselves this morning so i uh i mean hi how are you doing and now i have talk to

umhum 

Recording: (8622/ 10721) 
down there 

Recording: (8623/ 10721) 
right and then they wonder why uh you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way they will go the wrong thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (8624/ 10721) 
<laugh> yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the same up bringing through through mass media and and well mall <laugh> 

Recording: (8625/ 10721)

Recording: (8726/ 10721) 
um transportation this year that was kind of a i thought that rail system would kind of cool you know which is which is kind of a question is do we want to spend them money on it and when people actually use it um from then go live it goes back down to traffic and you know they can even be people driving both ways and i think if people are actually if they are gonna make it sure people are actually you are actually going to use it i think it will probably a pretty good thing to have and i i vote for it <laugh> if i if i know just i can not believe you are going to do that

Recording: (8739/ 10721) 
register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i could not vote till i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had a wait until i was twenty one so there was a bunch of us at college that 

Recording: (8740/ 10721) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeah umhum umhum umhum umhum

Recording: (8748/ 10721) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory uh sexual harassment tape and in in you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel as as instituted as your uh uh harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crashes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crashes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (8749/ 10721) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of a how much do you have to have of the to pass a law you know it can be something real real technical or something that a three year old can answer because it is trying kind of hit you know all the areas that you have learned

Recording: (8753/ 10721) 
<laugh> umhum 

Recording: (8754/ 10721) 
<laugh> i figure when the time comes i just have to figure it out <laugh> 

Recording: (8755/ 10721)

Recording: (8757/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8758/ 10721) 
with their cycle and that is the way the indian people we have many of the women referred to it as they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can not do that uh um there is just a lot there that uh you know women go through that purification every month so women

Recording: (8762/ 10721) 
well i mean i mean like i was saying i he is at the ages where he needs to you know start learning things and she just does not do that i and that is probably the way she raised her kids but now we have totally different opinions about everything 

Recording: (8763/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (8764/ 10721) 
have nones or anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they talked about kind of i doubt that they would have done that that early you know that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (8765/ 10721) 
it is more feasible than a six year old

Recording: (8795/ 10721) 
which i mean is not necessarily a bad thing but i mean it is something that is definitely noticeable in there 

Recording: (8796/ 10721) 
i do not think that i would have them go to any i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party and that kind of step was a lot a lot more focused than that i mean i did not even i do not think anybody even taught me on a way to cut stuff other than my parents so i mean it was it was interesting i mean it was a lot more cold bacetial kind of things to do a lot of things with nature and then they are kind of oh was the seventies too so i mean your husband will look at the time what we are talking about but

Recording: (8812/ 10721) 
kind of exciting because you know they get in on things that are really new and trying to master up the project i am working on now um just trying to find a way to to i to create data that describeses so the library is of course so the library is going to take this data and put it in their catalog and they would agree with their regular collection and we are doing a lot of with it yeah it is it is pretty it is a pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh job in the way give us opportunities to do things 

Recording: (8813/ 10721) 
i can not imagine them now doing it that way i mean personally i uh i i do not know there is so much i know about him and things i trust because i have known him forever there is so many i do not think people are honest and truthful these days i do not know i would have a hard time really getting into a relationship with somebody that i met today about knowing everything about them

Recording: (8815/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (8816/ 10721) 
and then in a little bit there is another one other side of us 

Recording: (8817/ 10721) 
i should not be having to clean quite as much as i do now um i would say by ten they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themselves i know i did it and and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house

umhum 

Recording: (8822/ 10721) 
and not that that changed my opinion for um but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are a shame about things and they should not be a shame because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (8823/ 10721) 
carable murderers you know away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think they are she would be in any plea bargains and they would be so horrible but there are people who get murdered you know instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is pure and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can putting appeals you think you that is it

the day i left the hospital he was running around with him and he 

Recording: (8933/ 10721) 
the big boys get all the breaks so uh in my opinion the judge did not want to hear the case before then or maybe his dog was full but i am saying you know there is no priorization in the legal system there are some things that uh should be addressed soon uh should have to wait that long but so then came down to one week prior to the uh hearing and

and i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know well 

Recording: (9030/ 10721) 
oh because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be first to know that there is uh a lot of favorism you know some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other 

Recording: (9031/ 10721) 
b a it was called <laugh> and that was interesting it was those are it is kind of an underclass teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hour and in my  chemistry class i was teaching i think total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty 

Recording: (9032/ 10721)

Recording: (9035/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9036/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9037/ 10721) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like where they call that uh culturally diversity or whatever classes they have is take i think but that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give you an example i did not grew up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives tracks and wears ball caps and less and 

Recording: (9038/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9039/ 10721) 
yeah but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not never expect to have another kid and her mother died during a pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and the mother is name was harry it 

Recording: (9040/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9041/ 10721) 
yes but there is nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic i would sort of been curious if they so i just figured something weird is going on i did not know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce well they did not just basically dumb because the divorce was not going to phase me because the entire marriage was we knew we knew from the beginning that was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of an individual so we are just kind of waiting around going oh i going to be door for a couple of months and sure enough so anyway um so i i look at these people in their names of the 

Recording: (9042/ 10721) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people at the pets say but it is just i could not be around that and then you know i would go off on people that would do that to bring it in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mail sometimes uh i am not a violent man either he is big as i am you know so 

Recording: (9043/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9044/ 10721)

um i do some much just not at one of them i just got back from lunch with them i mean i see them 

Recording: (9047/ 10721) 
where they are almost aggravating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in the way that some of the everybody from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity to people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people are doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines 

Recording: (9048/ 10721) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (9049/ 10721) 
right yeah well you can not even put a price on it either so 

Recording: (9050/ 10721) 
and a hole and they would still uh shake but uh and i do not remember i think they put one of our guns on a commission that time but they did not do as much damage as they might have 

Recording: (9051/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9052/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9053/ 10721)

sincr paper so when you write on the white copy it comes to onto the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just rips off the back copy in hands at to his friend so he he did not have to write you know if he was not getting the note 

Recording: (9073/ 10721) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (9074/ 10721) 
to all of this stuff and then you you know pretend that you are a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case and going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me i would say a my family my mom and dad um well i uh my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungry and that was a neat experience i like growing i am talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in hungry uh and he thought this is the greatest country in the world in that rub off on me i still do 

Recording: (9075/ 10721) 
about you and why are you doing this to my kid uh so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools uh so it just seems to be more you are not more you are not more you know when you are in the catholic school and you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to course by the way they deal with it they take the real problems and they move back to the public schools uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it 

Recording: (9076/ 10721) 
you know so unfortunately you know and i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressures put on school and education now 

Recording: (9077/ 10721) 
and i was not real anymore i was more surprised that they found a lot of like alcohol like i would not they you know like some people if they do drugs at school and stuff i am not saying that is right but they will they will do it but like alcohol it would be so hard to like high because it smells you know and you got to hold it out but they found like wonderful liquor and 

Recording: (9078/ 10721)

Recording: (9081/ 10721) 
well see my my husband would do that though it is so bizarre because it is i do not know what i i honestly do not i think that is where his brain is completely like he i mean i get make all the decision that my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says been not a good judge of that you will have to check it because my son well my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his scary morning friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on i said 

Recording: (9082/ 10721) 
in the dorms too and everything i have even like that like it was like i do not know it was like living in a hotel or something and it was really weird and like

Recording: (9086/ 10721) 
i mean i think he is done some kinds of things that whole thing about uh as far as like your student loan and being able to get into <laugh> that just helps me you know oh and i think you know all this that as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i 

Recording: (9087/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9088/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9089/ 10721)

Recording: (9094/ 10721) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (9095/ 10721) 
you know but they did not seem to have grown up in this you know terrible environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think a lot of more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know playate those sort of situations and uh i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i 

Recording: (9096/ 10721) 
deer space nine in that uh yeah different people of different i mean these were alien rather than different ethnic denominated of humans but it it approach that from a less um from a more realistic standpoint in instead of having you know like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come

Recording: (9098/ 10721) 
um as far as being homosexual so i mean i really can not say that i would say that effecting the kids 

Recording: (9099/ 10721) 
and i think that that is one of the things they can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence of a lot of kids is taking over their life and that it is not that now course yet if the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you go walk in the sit and turn it off and you can go in i guess and see what the wrong man they do not even have anything to say so you can not even be in the air anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program

Recording: (9221/ 10721) 
and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute you know i my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to you know get all the opportunities that were out there for them and and it just did not happen that you know we that we both had the same he wanted everything to be the same you know so i think that really changed to everything one kind of it does your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody is listening and everything you want to do somebody is 

Recording: (9222/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (9223/ 10721)

<laugh> yes exactly 

Recording: (9225/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9226/ 10721)

right 

Recording: (9230/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9231/ 10721) 
we start more again they have never learned and the reason why you are throwing it carry out too much in front about saying hey you got to do this approve this to me no we we we black i think oh one heck of a lot of ethnic oh moral status in this country we are losing every day and so we start looking our own in the mirror at night and say i am to myself i am probably why i did i may not have made a dollar a day but i understood somebody a day 

Recording: (9232/ 10721) 
my oldest son was in vietnam 

Recording: (9233/ 10721)

Recording: (9238/ 10721) 
appeals appeals 

Recording: (9239/ 10721) 
yeah just so smart 

Recording: (9240/ 10721) 
light news uh that is why i read it is tend to read alternative newspapers and stuff because you do get a different perspective it is probably just slanted but it is different they are right 

Recording: (9241/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9242/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9243/ 10721)

Recording: (9245/ 10721) 
yeah got into a situation where you really were there was no wind situation from the good go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we you went over there to do it initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so the capital political war is everybody knows anything about it 

Recording: (9246/ 10721) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned preverly i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i am i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appears to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because they are always different 

Recording: (9247/ 10721) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post part of them depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to beat these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control so oh uh and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (9248/ 10721)

Recording: (9252/ 10721) 
are not really saying much new but if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like the season see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they the did the platform that is all settled now and it is just sort of this you know this sunab man type stuff well that is not interesting oh it could change them who the primary is like to be 

Recording: (9253/ 10721) 
well i think the people that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs from more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (9254/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9255/ 10721)

Recording: (9256/ 10721) 
right so a lot of them already believe in that they have their own religion and they they are really faithful so that was one of the main problems that but they um they had been so holding onto that for so long and it is so strong they do not want to let go of well and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (9257/ 10721) 
and they finally just said i get where are they trying cleaning people to make one of these computer so 

Recording: (9258/ 10721)

Recording: (9261/ 10721) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember <laugh> a long time ago 

Recording: (9262/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9263/ 10721) 
and they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well they were not real the economy is doing really well and foreign relations are always shakey but to get getting a little bit better 

Recording: (9264/ 10721) 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know it was kind of appalling to to the parents and everything i guess maybe this were on coming from them and uh the way some for the uh case dress you know retro back too and worth the bell bottoms and everything to us and the uh the piercing i just can not get into that you know then some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my god they that fourteen to sixteen 

Recording: (9265/ 10721) 
maybe at the underlying base 

Recording: (9266/ 10721) 
are not they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (9267/ 10721) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at lsu and they were on them just asking people bill if they saw it that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i just like believe i would think so yeah <laugh> and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while that i read the book one women and i really prayed about it and 

Recording: (9268/ 10721) 
pretty soon you see all the money they have been making gone 

Recording: (9269/ 10721) 
drew downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and they would not have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking why why not do you that and oh there is also the whole pollution thing and and those types of things and i thought that was 

Recording: (9270/ 10721) 
second and and thirty i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering that is one of the reasons they were not going to move me 

Recording: (9271/ 10721) 
i do not want to tend to believe here so 

Recording: (9272/ 10721) 
so it was one of those

no they are not it is printed at the top every on every issue that they are financially independent 

Recording: (9274/ 10721) 
i mean yeah some people 

Recording: (9275/ 10721) 
is that i think i remember it like they were like remodeling a few years back is that right 

Recording: (9276/ 10721) 
yeah that is kind of odd to kind of like think of a factory like a like a punch card or something but uh and just how uh like there there is this whole thing that you know if we can not wear cat is and uh in the building and the whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff and it is just real funny to hear hear people speak like that and really believe that 

Recording: (9277/ 10721) 
i am going to get done with this i swear <laugh> 

Recording: (9278/ 10721) 
bring what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff and it does not even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is uh it is a struggle understanding that and uh uh i made it through all four rounds this time and uh even sat up which was the first time um it is a struggle but 

Recording: (9279/ 10721) 
i can

Recording: (9283/ 10721) 
and we were staying at his grandpa and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and see all kinds of racial slurs towards black people 

Recording: (9284/ 10721) 
but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (9285/ 10721) 
he is always saying oh this is racist and that is racist but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know their place is lots of sworeth like the south and so on course uh who who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (9286/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9287/ 10721) 
i do not know just exactly where the others are but they are over here in the plumber area 

Recording: (9288/ 10721) 
communications as you say through the internet and through businesses but we do not have compassion and we do not have commitment without those three you will never have success

Recording: (9296/ 10721) 
country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures are different so if you wanted to view that as a culturally or you know what they mean that that is something to a front um except the people you know how to like what they are doing but there is still people so 

Recording: (9297/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9298/ 10721)

Recording: (9303/ 10721) 
from you he gives something back i have had kids who that got every bad you can get in boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that that really it might not be related the school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in some other area like they are swimming or or scouting or whatever so they you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with 

Recording: (9304/ 10721) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (9305/ 10721)

Recording: (9309/ 10721) 
i have always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (9310/ 10721) 
um scary okay and it it was funny because you see the cops first but in reality the cops are behind two other people that actually know but as a matter because you always see cops first so the two other people that actually know are my stepmother stepmother uh parents stepfather and father have been split up for right i do not know a month or two now they have been married for something like six months now and uh my sister and i both went to tell her the time that she was making horrible mistake but 

Recording: (9311/ 10721) 
well see we have real traditional uh breakdown of of choice but only because that is just happened to be what we liked it the way we liked it do you know what i mean and it it is not um because you know i consider i my whole house all a lot of feminine you know we are all real strong about that but that is again since i have a luxury to being at home and peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and i am doing something i enjoy i really am happy to do all of this thing 

Recording: (9312/ 10721) 
um they more or less buy a dog for a token

Recording: (9497/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9498/ 10721) 
like you means actual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just coming from like christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice if they teach you how to be confident yourself and i do not mean like self esteem but you know like we said if if 

Recording: (9499/ 10721)

Recording: (9500/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9501/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9502/ 10721) 
uh it did not did not turn out very well so they switched over to me uh for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university is fault uh they had to rely on all law it was confidence we could not give it to them but they needed it so it it was just not a good good way to do business uh yeah 

Recording: (9503/ 10721) 
in what way 

Recording: (9504/ 10721) 
yeah

Recording: (9509/ 10721) 
well i am saying on the whole world and they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think maybe he sounds the same way but maybe you are not <laugh> so i have i thought when i retired i would just get this done and this done and this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got something to eat done so i got home and i am sure from doing it just as fast because over and over again people say i have never seen any of but it was as much energy your always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (9510/ 10721) 
yeah well 

Recording: (9511/ 10721)

Recording: (9516/ 10721) 
to their own guilt and uh <laugh> uh so i have got two sites to that once they need to work because they did it another side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh really incarination the law costs of effect and if a person  murderers somebody they need though they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made 

Recording: (9517/ 10721) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (9518/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9519/ 10721) 
i mean i 

Recording: (9520/ 10721)

Recording: (9521/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9522/ 10721) 
umhum

Recording: (9525/ 10721) 
from the media uh and i say media broad base you would be at print media or tv um that has this culture today of um a stars and you know media of uh phenomenalous and and they do not see the relevantance and i do not think they hear from their parents like uh i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not uh again i do not know what the the answer is 

Recording: (9526/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9527/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9528/ 10721)

Recording: (9536/ 10721) 
four girls 

Recording: (9537/ 10721) 
yeah it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they may have not 

Recording: (9538/ 10721) 
oh yeah by the 

Recording: (9539/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9540/ 10721) 
that is neat that is why i know they bring 

Recording: (9541/ 10721) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (9542/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9543/ 10721) 
uh i got done out of high school 

Recording: (9544/ 10721) 
that sort of thing then you are leaving out a long part the population so i am not sure it is gonna give out on results anyway 

Recording: (9545/ 10721) 
um and uh i think it feels it very well 

Recording: (9546/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9547/ 10721) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (9548/ 10721) 
now i got them 

Recording: (9549/ 10721) 
it is about the same 

Recording: (9550/ 10721)

Recording: (9551/ 10721) 
i wonder if that is also a socialized medicine there it is socialized is not it 

Recording: (9552/ 10721) 
donnais i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tube isters is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still not still much cheaper than them having kids oh um and then if they i would give more money to they clean of their act just for them um as far as it being races i do not think 

Recording: (9553/ 10721) 
but then you do not have that people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9554/ 10721) 
that is nice 

Recording: (9555/ 10721) 
and telecommunications very much like a highway you need to know what your load is going to be before you construction or right you know all the way you are paying is way off well nowadays we are in the possition where we are doing more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio and the private network uh as a private sector is still looking at us looking at us as a show okay these we are doing voice over ip and then and then poor call which means we are doing voice and data over the same pipe and 

Recording: (9556/ 10721) 
yeah it it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9557/ 10721) 
no it 

Recording: (9558/ 10721) 
and uh then the the powers that be in the american or immediate sense will go up to oh i always think for four months in jail 

Recording: (9559/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9560/ 10721)

Recording: (9564/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9565/ 10721) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9566/ 10721) 
i do not think i can answer that 

Recording: (9567/ 10721) 
see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really fairable and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five weeks out of hamster you know i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she she had not even been giving him food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you know yeah they do not get that stuff together our wind she was eleven weeks older 

Recording: (9568/ 10721) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is the you do not need a husband no he needs a burn bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9569/ 10721) 
anywaying really farming country and he he went out there from iowa where you so you so you are going to be running my corner down the field and 

Recording: (9570/ 10721) 
oh it is just so every the environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and um you know i think it is a friend much friendly or a place and then i i i just think the vibration are higher up there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live 

Recording: (9571/ 10721) 
just 

Recording: (9572/ 10721) 
it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (9573/ 10721) 
no i was not sure obviously but 

Recording: (9574/ 10721) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these like student mattoes especially going up like up like fifty huh <laugh> 

Recording: (9575/ 10721) 
they they just set up a on a flat bed truck on the wall street in new york and do a concert there <laugh> 

Recording: (9576/ 10721) 
and she was from germany which made a little talk because you know they did not talk about that that those things over there at all for a long time but uh and she became very open with them and everybody and that was in the eighties and you know it is some kids know it when they are young and growing up you i do not know if it is best to not to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are gonna deal with it a lot better than 

Recording: (9577/ 10721) 
yeah they certain two that and three 

Recording: (9578/ 10721) 
that is great 

Recording: (9579/ 10721) 
basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get it everything in still at home uh that is pretty much what in you know i have seen talk it to my husband and you know and there are so many broken homes and single moms and trying trying to do you at all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and have them grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (9580/ 10721) 
sure you know you do something with them but this group the the middle of the thirties i called them you had them is aer than and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is going to be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am antiabortion i i am pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that going against what most americans are saying door i think represented where most americans 

Recording: (9581/ 10721) 
uh yeah i have been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when i moved up to delaware <laugh> yeah it is a row conferming you know comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9582/ 10721) 
they saw us have difficult times and they saw us our spouse crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you could have being in human nature they saw that they saw the love for one other they saw over night where i start caring from my dad because my mother died instantly you know like short term an hour and now he has stroke i do not know whether i see other lives and i learn all that and i 

Recording: (9583/ 10721) 
i think my grand pago is at church 

Recording: (9584/ 10721) 
but see 

Recording: (9585/ 10721) 
um honestly it would be i would probably base the decision basically political um i can not stand really hold that against him or anything obviously it is not something that back oh good well it is been for him since he did that 

Recording: (9586/ 10721) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and they made that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (9587/ 10721) 
right wow 

Recording: (9588/ 10721) 
yeah like underground and it is kind of real big like it is still different too there is still like a really big scene and there is still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (9589/ 10721) 
she graduated from the past year so uh but she went to she went home she was in home study so 

Recording: (9590/ 10721) 
and it only took um less than two months 

Recording: (9591/ 10721) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so it was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give background on him and that what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out their that is going on then they are killing you um so i really do not see a big problem with 

Recording: (9592/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9593/ 10721) 
mean is than just giving them the number that we spent more time doing that uh 

Recording: (9594/ 10721) 
and you have been going to the high states that whole time 

Recording: (9595/ 10721)

Recording: (9597/ 10721) 
yeah there is almost nobody any more that is willing to do uh just uh minuscule things unless you are going to be uh it is just money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money uh just a 

Recording: (9598/ 10721) 
and she was speaking and and she started to speak i realized you know another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are because the world  world in essence it is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us there is just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on in our politics and on we as the people 

Recording: (9599/ 10721) 
go back and uh uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values uh i could even still go so far as to see any amazing or other psychology or any one of those those are specialized subject and and 

Recording: (9600/ 10721) 
well uh i was born on a homestead out in northern montana and then my parents moved back to iowa which was their home area southern iowa and i grew up there attended high school there and then i uh went to iowa state for five quarters and i just did not get it and then uh i work around home for a i

Recording: (9605/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9606/ 10721) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is an insanity but in my opinion there is nobody whoever kills anybody who is an insane and uh just to to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean kind of in the terms of the christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind 

Recording: (9607/ 10721) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave it up to the people 

Recording: (9608/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9609/ 10721) 
but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned to his uh parents that gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned fifty and they do not even have any kids and he says well how you did it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrifice and when you sacrifice it becomes you it makes you more horrible

Recording: (9612/ 10721)

mits over off of uh thirty three two seventy eight thirty seven 

Recording: (9622/ 10721) 
well in especially in my situation you know uh i would think about it quite a bit you know that i would have had a more of an opportunity to have a one on one uh relationship with her i probably uh uh being a girl you know could have probably helped around and uh i do not know a lot of social social things social things you know about and because i i kind of get the impression that she you know really she is doing it very interested in men you know so 

Recording: (9623/ 10721) 
no because like the i work like i said my supervisor is a black woman and i get along good with her the the old other woman that is an indian woman i get real along real good with her the other guy is black i get along real good with her but my supervisor is got a friend that is a black one that works in the department you know she will come and talk to her and double all her work on uh 

Recording: (9624/ 10721)

Recording: (9649/ 10721) 
other persons wrongly but at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong you know so that is not right due i i i actually do not know uh people get really scared they are certain i mean like uh there is certain denomination that will take one it is sort of like the out of limits it will take one book or one script out of the bible and it expand it 

Recording: (9650/ 10721) 
um as far as affiliated with a party i probably respond to um republicans more than democrats but i think given any um given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (9651/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9652/ 10721) 
exactly right yeah yeah and you know a lot of people i work with do not see that and you know they think i am a real cheapskate you know because you know i well i spend money you know and well i i am very so in fact if i mean like uh i love to go to disney world and other people work to not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in you know now i drive there i do not fly because i am really that cheap but you know i would love to fly but i just go oh my gosh you know but you know i will do that but you know like um like at uh thanksgiving time we do not buy butter balter turkey we 

Recording: (9653/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9654/ 10721) 
i ended up uh running away from home yeah 

Recording: (9655/ 10721) 
the medication is like the difference between night and day you go back and observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids have done phasing they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stuncher grows and they some do your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headaes from dek is a drain and adiral so i say you know if it works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because 

Recording: (9656/ 10721) 
i felt i get better attention when i wanted it you know uh then i would have at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (9657/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9658/ 10721) 
yeah yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (9659/ 10721) 
because i am becoming back to the point to the right if i have like any time away from my girlfriend 

Recording: (9660/ 10721) 
four years that are out there many and one and that will do that uh more power to them uh all i can do is pray them on it and that is what i suggest to everybody else that is the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the ones in high school that taught me had a post around the wall that said more things are uh in this world by prayer than will ever know 

Recording: (9661/ 10721) 
this little kid who still has a living parent and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know a way out of line and 

Recording: (9662/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9663/ 10721) 
i know i am <laugh> i can not wait because i the house we live in at the half double one we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but you know i have like eighty plants in my house now but i just can not wait to have my own space so i never plant anything in the ground there because of that well i am going to leave you know and 

Recording: (9664/ 10721) 
now we run an on line system where people usen connect our system and build the data bases or or access to the data bases uh it is state that uh everything of what she has in their library collection is in our system their records came from us oh yeah that well they yeah and we do that for uh tens of thousand some labor yeah 

Recording: (9665/ 10721) 
uh being here at the university 

Recording: (9666/ 10721) 
but not all of them are uh you know are that what 

Recording: (9667/ 10721) 
i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it you know dealt with in a common reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kid yeah 

Recording: (9668/ 10721) 
just a job <laugh> that is another thing job 

Recording: (9669/ 10721) 
see uh he he is he is just he is in his two is and i do like he is got to be in a cart or something well because when i am holding his hand and taking a he just tends to want to he is not common <laugh> he is little you know um so i that is why we do not do nothing because when i take them to people is houses i i can not do that because they will get into everything and i i am i get real stressed out about that i do not i do not 

Recording: (9670/ 10721) 
yes private homes and um actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (9671/ 10721) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (9672/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9673/ 10721) 
i would say probably the black man 

Recording: (9674/ 10721) 
i have been some places where some men refused to sweat with women sometimes i felt kind of weird about it 

Recording: (9675/ 10721) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (9676/ 10721) 
yeah <laugh> that is it 

Recording: (9677/ 10721) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (9678/ 10721) 
right and and also the other thing is you you have to be sort of compassionate because like you know you are you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you have spent something out you want to a answer you know each air plane is supposed to respond with their calls on like if i tell somebody you know turn left getting three six they are on he is supposed to respond tina bay three ninety six roger well if he does not respond then i would got to say it again which means instead of ten airplanes i know i have eleven i am talking to because i still talk to him two times each so you know there are some people that yet really 

Recording: (9679/ 10721) 
no 

Recording: (9680/ 10721) 
no i mean it is nothing crazy where they think they got it 

Recording: (9681/ 10721) 
if that happened i would be ten times more understanding and i would say you know i would not accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes 

Recording: (9682/ 10721) 
they do not do it today unless a person is a scholar i mean a three point eight road scholar and i hey okay 

Recording: (9683/ 10721) 
i am 

Recording: (9684/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9685/ 10721) 
yeah but you know what his parents are going you know really going to let people know that 

Recording: (9686/ 10721) 
and then they physically die before they got a chance to live and while their spirit fakes up and finds out that they are physically dead and they can not do anything in the physical world any more they want to draw themselves too especially if they were a bad person they want to draw them to the 

Recording: (9687/ 10721) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named how he sat and he found himself because he was hot 

Recording: (9688/ 10721) 
yeah <laugh> i do not really have any child is recollections of california yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (9689/ 10721) 
hum well that bathroom is starting to sound good right about 

Recording: (9690/ 10721) 
you have got to help here to make them and i think that that is one of the problem too many people think instead of just getting them to love them to help each other because we are supposed to help each other other and this goes all right back to what he said you said beginning in school or kindergarten i think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes times to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it above all and rock it and sing to it put it to the bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up teach them how to tie their shoes and take them off teach them how to do everything they are 

Recording: (9691/ 10721) 
okay so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you are talking a little different approach in answering a question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding in the base upon the word respect it not ever been in the fall so uh i was not any kind of course you know i have not gone to the line yet not i have my phone would not want to be able to do that they need to be over there or they need know the wine in my car is not going to hold them over the back yard now hum how come is the weather on the news oh well i do not want to give you any that but anyway it if i told them they could not do it i would try it that is weird going to write my background and i know that uh i would try it very very far i got twelve months and i got a girl i had a girl and i am sure going to be a little more of my little girl and then anyway and i am doing college you and you can not catch me doing something they would come to the snow you cannot do i would apologize these mommy ones back along and i got just a mouth on the<laugh> well it is not going to be ever going to be on the bus now i mean now i am going to bewell the bus i do not know the cherry fire and apple wowas umhum yeah well the other men were <laugh> <laugh> 

Recording: (9692/ 10721) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you have got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (9693/ 10721) 
before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and it there were a few pluses that really stood out where you know there was sort of you know you would i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh you know what what this this america you know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my uh peers and classes i mean not directly they 

Recording: (9694/ 10721) 
even republicans were like that 

Recording: (9695/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9696/ 10721) 
it is been completely outrageous story lines and the jokes are not as integrated into to the story 

Recording: (9697/ 10721) 
just getting a couple of shirts or something you know she always bought my clothes anyway so she is getting a couple of she is getting whatever you think i need you know i will be here drinking beer was it she will be here was not for it is

Recording: (9701/ 10721) 
that goes a lot longer than just giving them that because they give it they do not do it so i i really i really think uh um as i would say traveling uh people are all the same world of mine they just give them different colors different face different accents different so a guy can get them unique characters he so he can call him his own and he knows each of all of us but uh we are all the same his 

Recording: (9702/ 10721)

Recording: (9712/ 10721) 
oh sure 

Recording: (9713/ 10721) 
well i believe us quality is not quite going to uh ideally you know from one part it would be they are being they or if you know you know in the entire life i mean umhum well at least you know the you know your quality time is more important you know neat if you go come home and you you know oh you want to do is set down was like was not too many here drinking beer or whatever you know not spending any time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are there for two hours 

Recording: (9714/ 10721)

Recording: (9718/ 10721) 
she new head a little more knowledge a little more support around you educating knowing selfdiscipline and on what is on the really important i would say the crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children do not know the dads

most people i associate with and this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents where as kids you know 

Recording: (9729/ 10721) 
there in open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with children 

Recording: (9730/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9731/ 10721) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to the high state uh compared to miami university i i see differences in the standards of the of the students uh but i believe and i have seen it with my son going out of the state that his more  girls that he is gained through his uh pre college years are staying with him uh and i am very grateful that there is

well you know it because i have to think of a hot one back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know did not t cost me to more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars i would i was happy

Recording: (9792/ 10721) 
i mean they they went to the polls and drove she did not have to you know the the hope there was that they would not go to vote <laugh> on the school every oh they are actually trying to get college kids in involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (9793/ 10721) 
umhum because i white his morals and his you know his basic stuff to come from from me really 

Recording: (9794/ 10721)

Recording: (9799/ 10721) 
yeah avoiding the the steaks is pretty much what they need to do better decisions that help 

Recording: (9800/ 10721) 
well that depends i think i like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites um in the symphonyy uh unfortunately they tend to have budget problems uh um because a lot of the people in that group are paid uh i get i get paid kind of a semi professional 

Recording: (9801/ 10721) 
and pardon him sounds pretty good so 

Recording: (9802/ 10721) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of uh registered voters and crossout those who voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of 

Recording: (9803/ 10721) 
um yeah i mean i have got girls that are that have girl friends and stuff and that does not bother me i i mean i am not i like men and i i am i am a christian and i just believe that you know you should be you should she does not the guy did not put two women on the sort of i did not put two men they put a man and a woman to be together to have kids

Recording: (9808/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9809/ 10721) 
gone down hill huh 

Recording: (9810/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9811/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9812/ 10721) 
and and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9813/ 10721) 
ah probably 

Recording: (9814/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9815/ 10721)

Recording: (9817/ 10721) 
just ridiculous the barberism to me they uh 

Recording: (9818/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (9819/ 10721) 
i talk to all my family my brother is sisters every day 

Recording: (9820/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9821/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9822/ 10721) 
it is really whacky stuff 

Recording: (9823/ 10721) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (9824/ 10721) 
uh but the dispthe only reason they get thed is the suspension they do one of the ones going around locally 

Recording: (9825/ 10721) 
cancered in that in the paper uh but i have sung in well shah and sing in the symphony of course too i have sung for sixteen years 

Recording: (9826/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9827/ 10721) 
too much 

Recording: (9828/ 10721) 
they 

Recording: (9829/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9830/ 10721) 
you know my older sister a different case you look better but it it you know as long as you have a good parent it you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom home was my mother and father she she did very well 

Recording: (9831/ 10721) 
i do not want to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what to do is find 

Recording: (9832/ 10721) 
yeah i do that 

Recording: (9833/ 10721) 
yeah yeah <laugh> it might be umhum umhum 

Recording: (9834/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9835/ 10721) 
no it is kind of neat though 

Recording: (9836/ 10721) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she still that she lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (9837/ 10721) 
i think that the 

Recording: (9838/ 10721) 
that is here at activities and the mentality and all that they come here and if they can not make it then they will just bomb somewhere and then <laugh> but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you i you would kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and you know it would be interesting oh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that uh you know if they are if they are caught uh in in any kind of 

Recording: (9839/ 10721) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate of public schools for them 

Recording: (9840/ 10721) 
it is it is amazing and that is something i know my husband we always joke about he talk tells this guys at work you know like um you know to take flowers for no reason you know well like like one guy was telling me he was saying somebody was her average and the other said well i can take flowers something and the guy goes oh i do not know and he said trust me take some flowers 

Recording: (9841/ 10721) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it it is been an investment for him but he loves his baby brother uh it is it is really he he nurses them too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (9842/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9843/ 10721) 
oh okay 

Recording: (9844/ 10721) 
and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (9845/ 10721) 
no commitment uh these guys have commitment and you see guys out there they one they go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe feels something whatever it is you ask each individual what does it drives you and that is the thing you know i guess so perturbit interviews they ask somebody an and somebody comes back and said you know i mean yeah uh what did he no i do not i did not say the guy is money i do not way but did he mean 

Recording: (9846/ 10721) 
well they are supposed to do more too but by the time they get the fourth grade they are so busy trying to be the class class they decide it is a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to fill your mind with knowledge oh gee 

Recording: (9847/ 10721) 
hm 

Recording: (9848/ 10721) 
she does not just used the word penalty uh penalty has been lots of different death conditions each individual has uh mental picture what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences so i i want to take just an you say penalty in a very general border of way whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left let us come back to about the middle i am 

Recording: (9849/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9850/ 10721) 
okay i i 

Recording: (9851/ 10721) 
and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god to believe in it as you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is very my very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this and like he said me me me and i got to have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we order people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself and 

Recording: (9852/ 10721) 
it is in northern ohio it is near ill area which is west of cleveland 

Recording: (9853/ 10721) 
yeah i do not i hear some of that from gorb in that as much 

Recording: (9854/ 10721) 
interstate but i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that is what i believe my faith is my faith is is faith it is believing that things happen that you can not explain there is it is believing that uh you are doing what you are doing is right so religians a real big part of my life 

Recording: (9855/ 10721) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (9856/ 10721) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects the same violation and people just about have quite injee 

Recording: (9857/ 10721) 
i think so i think so um it is it is uh it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off now i do not mean it is by any stretch it is a tragic to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (9858/ 10721) 
different ideas about it put it over everything 

Recording: (9859/ 10721) 
you are you are here for a reason and you are here in the united states for a reason of all the behind it you have here do not you think it is time this year for a reason you are the talent and to not necessarily be recognized for those things but you know some some personnel is required personnel is the way it is but uh to do things about expecting something to return that would be so nice to see that written on the magazine fronts oh yeah we 

Recording: (9860/ 10721) 
you know cause when you are overseas it is a different environment 

Recording: (9861/ 10721) 
oh i take the little ladiess i take the church 

Recording: (9862/ 10721) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal team and i think most of the people well i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen you know good i <laugh> eleven twelve so i can we would look 

Recording: (9863/ 10721) 
there is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help express you with children and they have these new guns that um not just the safety lock but you know you it is like identification thing you know 

Recording: (9864/ 10721) 
my mother is go in get more they will not get that heck out you know 

Recording: (9865/ 10721) 
no i thought my son 

Recording: (9866/ 10721) 
yeah <laugh> 

Recording: (9867/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9868/ 10721) 
i should not have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for money or previouslyly done work for money or something of conscious and stupid like a franchise for money i would been favor of that i what put a good system of what you do things they sell it to you you go do those things i said i am gonna make money off of your efforts yeah that so 

Recording: (9869/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (9870/ 10721) 
umhum oh yes you you know well you can see it here i mean you uh see so i am nineteen year old or eighteen year old uh b from now see uh difference in the majority you know of of another couple or three different people or whatever uh i do not know whether me coming from like a rural area you know my a and everything uh i think it maybe has something to do with that even to today you know you are more 

Recording: (9871/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9872/ 10721) 
and my own civilian insurance i said you know why would you want to get up with an original you know why would you want to get up with an original and have a copy because all these others and one bb is whatever you you felt christian they 

Recording: (9873/ 10721) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (9874/ 10721) 
yeah i think the terrific for the right things 

Recording: (9875/ 10721) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be public grade if he does not that is a 

Recording: (9876/ 10721) 
that is much probably 

Recording: (9877/ 10721) 
humum 

Recording: (9878/ 10721) 
and then but the whole band in the cheerleers went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart runching 

Recording: (9879/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9880/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9881/ 10721) 
well 

Recording: (9882/ 10721) 
yeah um the second thing would be uh the um cultural activities that we have um i am b xoner center it would be one of my primary ones because there is so much going on down there but the art museum and um uh oh right that cultural arts center and columbus music hall i mean it is just a million things 

Recording: (9883/ 10721) 
umhum my you know to me the thing that hurts me the most out of it is they want to put caps on our salaries so i am at the high that scale i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to until unless i move into supervision or something up in the and i will be out of the the union if i do that anyway so but they are gonna put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am 

Recording: (9884/ 10721) 
it is good money yeah um one idea that i just had recently is medical insurance which is a person who has an md in his computers and so there made not too many interests i thought doing both would be really cool 

Recording: (9885/ 10721) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (9886/ 10721) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at an high school 

Recording: (9887/ 10721) 
but you are working now janet 

Recording: (9888/ 10721) 
whatever you going to get away with 

Recording: (9889/ 10721) 
i do kind of 

Recording: (9890/ 10721) 
i really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (9891/ 10721) 
wow 

Recording: (9892/ 10721) 
uh college without the tuition 

Recording: (9893/ 10721) 
and then uh after so long and time after they do not know how long they they get them the powers are being able we will fool them we will fog up that whole area with smoke 

Recording: (9894/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9895/ 10721) 
they they definitely struggle they they do i i think to be that high up obviously you are gonna come in kind of second to car for people i have ridged people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than they are <laugh> so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (9896/ 10721) 
he misses and hits my window so it is a truck bob yeah 

Recording: (9897/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9898/ 10721) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (9899/ 10721) 
stuff everyday there was a new twist on the story that or they now the news was that there was not a news twist yeah i do not care but you could not turn it off because that is all that was on 

Recording: (9900/ 10721) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more of the most kindergartners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him hope around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is education on base usually and i let him play on the computer 

Recording: (9901/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9902/ 10721) 
uh and at least it gave you a lot of different feel 

Recording: (9903/ 10721) 
you know and and it is just i think they do not happen so often and too many people are even involved the whole thing with the oakland when you are talking circle around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (9904/ 10721) 
be in turn to way 

Recording: (9905/ 10721) 
i am not real big on the denominationations because i think that i think that is sort of goes against what the original intent of christianity was i i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and this denomination of nations there are just are are just yeah i just i do not like them <laugh> 

Recording: (9906/ 10721) 
yeah but my oldest she is the oldest uh she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees them um and then they got two other girls and they live together they go to the house you know their own they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got a older 

Recording: (9907/ 10721) 
umhum at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if that was my own personal child i would not move move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so it is such a bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it uh and if they do not pull their scores up uh they will you know 

Recording: (9908/ 10721) 
yeah and uh she is adorable 

Recording: (9909/ 10721) 
at um i think it was not criminal we went over the weekend and we went there saturday morning and i have got this forty five minute all three sound tape of the baby which is cute because you can only see parts of that but you can really you can see it is face you can see what it looks like and everything but i said i do not want to know the sex and it is so hard to because we are looking of course we are going to this came try to see if we can see anything and you just just kids huh i think she was real careful to make sure that that we would not be able to know she said i know what it is but i said i am all right well do not tell us so so now so now 

Recording: (9910/ 10721) 
and 

Recording: (9911/ 10721) 
they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this stick and it was only about paint 

Recording: (9912/ 10721) 
oh 

Recording: (9913/ 10721) 
i know 

Recording: (9914/ 10721) 
i do that every once in a while just like when i get bored 

Recording: (9915/ 10721) 
and they ought actually offered an early retirement because the funds i do not know if you may not remember about three years ago it is four years ago that the federal government was not going to pass a budget no so when that does not happen on budget and it cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that which is actually more money than they were gonna give us before than uh so they had to they would have to layoff people or offer retirement so i took the retirement 

Recording: (9916/ 10721) 
or they made after that they had the lottery number and that was not up to high you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what is it would be worth knowing that you are going to get another of those uh prepare your order uh because i have had friends that got numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting over the whole lot of my god so 

Recording: (9917/ 10721) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (9918/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9919/ 10721) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dimeses i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the taurus like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked but 

Recording: (9920/ 10721) 
i do not really remember october but <laugh> 

Recording: (9921/ 10721) 
uh kind of yeah uh actually with this case i do know what happened to the father they ended up moving to colorado uh 

Recording: (9922/ 10721) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (9923/ 10721) 
well uh one thing you know being uh uh i came from basically a poor neighbor poor poor uh uh lifestyle early life and everything you know so uh uh if anything i guess that kind of made me negative uh of course people that had influence and had money and did not do any thing good with you know on the firm believer that if you get something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what up for each but you know that is that would be a 

Recording: (9924/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9925/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9926/ 10721) 
in the strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (9927/ 10721) 
pretty well they 

Recording: (9928/ 10721) 
<laugh> especially while you know we try to see up five in the morning <laugh> 

Recording: (9929/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9930/ 10721) 
and they would ask you know can i do this can i use this uh kids now if i take my phone off and light on my desk kids will walk right up and just take it they will not ask me and they just said oh and then they show bush and but did your phone like uh if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you would not like it much would you 

Recording: (9931/ 10721) 
you can not explain it and those have been questions i have been asked by much our children well how did your mom know what she uh how did you know them well hey that is a that is one they risking life married but the thing is do you want to make it work 

Recording: (9932/ 10721) 
see that is great though 

Recording: (9933/ 10721) 
and i was born in new york 

Recording: (9934/ 10721) 
i do not put up with anyone is crap but long driving long distances is not good for me focusing concentrate uh and and i i have had you know several accidents several tickets uh so i mean i have even had uh you know to other head injuries 

Recording: (9935/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9936/ 10721) 
yeah oh yeah and uh you know i i always use it as a with a decoration under bed and but i think that that is a lot of the main problem really 

Recording: (9937/ 10721) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back gulf finances uh we are we are not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some there was infoance but i think the influence was not financial it was influenced from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with 

Recording: (9938/ 10721) 
and then we go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9939/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9940/ 10721) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9941/ 10721) 
so 

Recording: (9942/ 10721) 
and uh she said well maybe it just will go out and get a job she does not need to be sitting around here 

Recording: (9943/ 10721) 
okay 

Recording: (9944/ 10721) 
really 

Recording: (9945/ 10721) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (9946/ 10721) 
i can not see a lot of substance uh he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then put it back his in the down really back track it is just like it is not anything really firm i mean even with mcke and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what the points they wanted to make and that i do not hear that coming from bush 

Recording: (9947/ 10721) 
um i i have lived in columbus my entire life thirty four years um born and raised on the west side of columbus um 

Recording: (9948/ 10721) 
yeah yeah i do not feel that i do not feel like i do not feel like i sit down with the teenagers anymore either <laugh> 

Recording: (9949/ 10721) 
he was lucky 

Recording: (9950/ 10721) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a little if you are exchangeing hours for money or time for money then you have a fine amount of time and it is 

Recording: (9951/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (9952/ 10721) 
umhum 

Recording: (9953/ 10721) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (9954/ 10721) 
but 

Recording: (9955/ 10721) 
i do because they were not you know they were not in their children is lives enough you know they were not talking about things being open about things and dinner you know and finding out about school um i you can not blame them for having a so i do not really have not too many parents would know about that they their kids you know um but now i i i put them blame on the parents 

Recording: (9956/ 10721) 
i guess they still going to build it so 

Recording: (9957/ 10721) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (9958/ 10721) 
that is that is yeah it developmental because by did not did you know the reason they pick the age five to start school has because that is when some experts got that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full covenants does not take over till about age eight 

Recording: (9959/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (9960/ 10721)

umhum uhhuh 

Recording: (10045/ 10721)

Recording: (10071/ 10721) 
you know i am like i am like depressed <laugh> because like man i guess they i get a few months here and i want to just get you know just like when it gets like uh i have not decided heck i because i heard like you there is some people going to be like a you you can even like do uh teaching over there like teaching english or even going to be a nanny it is like so you know it is like if i have you know the right right right position opens <laugh> i may not be becoming back anytime soon really

Recording: (10097/ 10721) 
but you know it is a very un structured in non structured environment which my son went to work and then they do not have sports but these kids get scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and we are talking big money scholarship full scholarship so if they are able to do it there at that one school you know they could

Recording: (10263/ 10721) 
no every once in a while with my grandmother she always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school and she died in sometimes i think boy she really liked it that i was a nurs because i still use her blood pressure cup and everything she had given the air blood pressure cup i mean that is very old

the big mistake i got to college and it just went down hill i had all that freedom and they had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in hand basket summer um spring quarter i switch my major in music because i am extremely musically inclined it is one of the gifts that i have gotten and um that uh that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realize that just like acting you are all good ninety 

Recording: (10265/ 10721) 
i was born in brooklyn new york 

Recording: (10266/ 10721)

Recording: (10269/ 10721) 
yeah the big things 

Recording: (10270/ 10721) 
but they were one or two eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put hours worth of research into then sketch and i mean it was just 

Recording: (10271/ 10721) 
um 

Recording: (10272/ 10721) 
and uh maybe that is why you know it is like that but 

Recording: (10273/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10274/ 10721) 
yeah 

Recording: (10275/ 10721)

Recording: (10277/ 10721) 
but it is a uh smaller cancer school you know in saint louisville 

Recording: (10278/ 10721) 
yeah that that is one of the drawbacks 

Recording: (10279/ 10721) 
and every night you just get there right the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and that is the night but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (10280/ 10721) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know <laugh> 

Recording: (10281/ 10721) 
right 

Recording: (10282/ 10721) 
just because you know it was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the tax book they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notes like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um so i think it it is it and when people have real enthusiasm like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not 

Recording: (10283/ 10721) 
a condominium or something one floor plan 

Recording: (10284/ 10721)

umhum yes and old and old eyesore that they should have got rid of years again but 

Recording: (10381/ 10721) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends this parent mother is worth there and they had to clean they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know kids a lot of them who have when they parents have money and 

Recording: (10382/ 10721) 
no not really i do not know what even is to eat down here awfullys 

Recording: (10383/ 10721)

Recording: (10385/ 10721) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to the schools on that issue then yeah i i agree with the gambling thing you know just as long as it is like social drinking <laugh> and in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i bought a one dollar a lot of the ticket one two bucks off of it so 

Recording: (10386/ 10721) 
umhum right there 

Recording: (10387/ 10721) 
and uh it it is great we have been re engineered last eight years oh downizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the what the person brings to work as opposed to uh one of the problems that i see as an as an employer or as a supervisor manager and in other times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order come up there they do not quite consider getting so much in the attibutes of the person is house and so now we are saying okay have you bring 

Recording: (10388/ 10721) 
uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know they are not completely thrown together like uh balana and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (10389/ 10721) 
wow i mean 

Recording: (10390/ 10721) 
week in in jail or something but eighteen of them and you are racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (10391/ 10721) 
in some ways i like it and some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is relatively safe place to live although that is coming from i mean i have been robbed a gun point or and i have point about four times i think in columbus yeah maybe five um i  drove a taxi cab for a couple of summers and i was robbed i think twice driving the cab 

Recording: (10392/ 10721)

Recording: (10399/ 10721) 
short uh s a for for a test and uh but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know it would come up with a rubber and i would they you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for you mentioned that sort of thing <laugh> yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher where who is had to assign their grade creative writing and im not sure i would know how to do that yeah 

Recording: (10400/ 10721)

Recording: (10403/ 10721) 
oh and they cute

Recording: (10405/ 10721) 
and he and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough to pretty him to start out because he was behind and 

Recording: (10406/ 10721) 
yeah i do not think uh i do not think there should be any more uh new developments just yet you know just that kind of weed out a little bit of the population put one part of the population in this neighborhood and you know just pretty much divided off so it is not to uh not too crowded one place and then not too vacant other places 

Recording: (10407/ 10721)

so 

Recording: (10425/ 10721) 
and and the data they collect is just i mean by i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basic data essentially how many people they live in the household one of their ages in race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself but 

Recording: (10426/ 10721) 
yeah it is not like there is a face behind like the music but not so much too you know it is not like

Recording: (10440/ 10721) 
really

Recording: (10700/ 10721) 
too long or a sentence that is a segment and it is not a complete thought you are not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you oh well i had a
