imean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay oqay were they gay before but they did like women 

Recording: (37/ 8002) 
only the only can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that but people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in you know in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are not they are to blame am that whole thing with the yum school out in colorado am i forget the name of ye but when they said that those boys were making those guns and the garage and the parents did not were cluless i just find out really hard to believe if a child goes into a garage every night and you hear clanging and andthey are buying gun metal and you know then they were totally am not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing the am havin a sight on the internet 

Recording: (38/ 8002)

Recording: (42/ 8002) 
think it is really i do not think it is really affected me that mean obviously there is more place a sto go shopping or to eat or there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for am but i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighbourhood it is it was where you went to school with the people once at least once in went to high schol i went to public school

te crime as it is not is an interesting term m all crimes all murders are hate related i am not sure that is it is difficult we had civil writes laws many people were opposed to those but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism am and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime are you noare you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murderd some one else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a law on the books i do not think we need to have i hate crime over and above that y theethe people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it ii think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rightes an the affirmative action programmes and the bussing did to people is going to turn people against a t gaze like that turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association was very active in the sixties in opening up restaurants in the south and marching and y goin to opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things are not better ah now that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behaviour and the behaviour changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all rihte jury convict white men of coof killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now

any more you are lucky if you know you are neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on t v or radio or fia telephone or whatever

they just do not have those said the ao meedenei gorman 

Recording: (91/ 8002)

but if you love th if you love some one you wante to do what is right and you wanted to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in otherwards you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here iam nogor let it get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i tried to teach you differently i dont not were you went wrong and dont wat i did wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere but now you said family yes i think the reason that it aurage we can look back every one was born and every one was loved by a father mothy when they were little and how they are formityofe years are and the education the a the way they were a taught as they were grown up does help them to becoome what that president is what that polity any politician is any minister or anybody else the way you are raised i firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things at i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happene back here you know and i think that it bears on everybody so that is why it really begins with the family

i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught am the only thing probably is like what they call that a cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea a because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives tracks and wears bawl caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not oq i think that would be a good idea or you know culture is all different so if you want to view that as a culture or doudo noty mean that that is something different ah except the people you do not have to like what they are doing but theyre still people so

but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one there around their parents in their siblings and that socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that tom they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peer is opinions because for one example the poky mond craze my son did not know what pokymon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like always cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean you know it i mean ecause it is like t they just blow up each other o whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about i o he must be cool cose some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was notcl so that was my influen art influence on him rather than the peer is influence on him

i just renewed my ccertificate last year so i mak it bac can not do it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go can arrange hours with ha student that is at home for some reason a i had one that just had a baby and a they it is an interesting job because they looked for somebody that can cover the most technical i ge subject that thi student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once ind it it was a algebra to another time but they expected us to at least they expected me a to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history so it really requires you to be well rounded and i would like kind of like that a i have taught in a couple of other places a community colleges h college in new work i taught a chemistry class there and community college which is in hillsborough but i taught it there branch and i taught a introduct an introduction to a collegy class there an introduction to introduction to the arts was called and that was interesting it was at thes er it is kind of an under class of teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you a per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour so

i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple times and i do not know he just impresses me more than algore 

Recording: (3292/ 8002) 
i think more what they need to do is in strict er oh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shooting amd things like that ah because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean i feelike in other countries i mean like people like the age and countries places like that i mean thave really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism yourself serving jail time and get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean in some cases that will leave i chain you up in beatyo in public for it ah and i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it i mi think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they can get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone yoyoue not even get thirty days in jail and here can be let go i mean it is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (3293/ 8002) 
and the stern expression of the expression on tha face can be equally effective as the smack o on the bottom with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know the mi the most effective penalty for me was my mother i would a go out near a tree and she would break a twig off and she would smack me across the shoulder and yot it left marks but ansure it hurt iman it would stin and i understood exactly what was meant i think i grew up and i bein it up being i think a quite successful person and i think my mother had athirteen of the fifteen children who lived all pretty dol going decent kids and none of us were injured none of us were hurt and that was a basic method a penalty it was not something of truly her injured to day however i suspect my mam could easily b could have been charged with abuse child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder were that a green switch it is always a green switch cause tethe old ones they would break you do on rake break

it is in education it is its top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i will be gone by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as a education like for small school and they just open up their p h d program ind education and they are all setnon for political science but it is a real conservative political science anit is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things o like that it is dry they have a real strict visitation policies things like that and my thought is if you are if your if you are considered adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i rememberan i was a freshman in college e s we did crazy things but still you know 

Recording: (3386/ 8002)

if you did not own let usay on a school leving you did you pay taxes i always bcause i rent and i always get very upset i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do cause every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built in to the rent at least its it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord and io i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after a school levey passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond o of what the levee was hso that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know cause a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools no but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry h youre democracy could go down the drain ah that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or o know a the university of virginia and believed in education because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues but it is very difficult to day to get to people a i have talked to some aalmost college age students and they do not see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why

well i do not think they should be responsibut i think am kids go to school and they need real models good teachers am and i think schools have got a lot better about that it seem lik in the late eighties aarly nineties you know the schools lot of em were really bad am i think finally the education department or whatevers realizing that parents need help whath their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school an you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot am and i think now through education because it is hard all these schools and so many roal wearers and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is always has to do with money an the am not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked and all these big large class rooms it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a click together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say al what is going on in your life whits what is the problem you know that is that is not really should be their roll but im if they care enough they should call their parents and say look worred about your son he misses lots school or he is starting to dress really you know sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if hey do not wat to be in sports that is fine theres so many different things at they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and you know but im un fortunate lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can not do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home you know i mean

iyou know i think to i apologize to my oldest daughter amost every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable over what they can do because if they are really verbal ama kids always have been really verbal because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even what you know when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole time i would sly yo coulnd see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really rerbal and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we gout a hampster ow i simple you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she had not given in been givin im food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bed room furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else while within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year n to have she only had a adress on the floor in her room because but i mean all that was bazaar now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things ori would take more responsibility rather than especting them to have it and secondly

i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future a going all the way back a finances wer were not a consideration n itd o i say probably mi first thirty may be forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed w that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point the but he would swa them based upon the influences that he had had from a various people within his community whether whether you are talking about a township or county state whatever it may be and yes then pslowly then i think the finances came in the play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of to day and i will leave out this the last two years it ecause it is cause it is rather sspecific right now but going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on a national level but i amsing even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there a i come on well go to dinner we will wo to this and we will do this and do this just just barely barly breaking the barrier but not breaking the law so yes very definitely progressively has changed

well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people prr would not want a college education ah but like a trade or a skill or something that will give em a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice up in their head oq i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun am i mean if they want a college education ah yet itit is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a life style i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens then somebody robbing me some day because they did not get an education i mean that is a broadspectrum and i know it is not all that cut and dried ah yet would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bin and go well maybe it is for the best

a k it is part of growing up i have been there done that too but still you have to you have to a know there is respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you have got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they solve the interaction with the elder people the school he went to there is a lot of public invovement public service required the teachers i often asked the teachers i have gone to sporting events and the are teachers are there ticket takers a monitorying the crowd where the kids i asked answerd do you gons geve to go home no oh ye is it but they are always there they are not they are just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are ther after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people thetre on the clock whp time to quit they are gone those people kno not know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is have problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willig to work not knowing they are gongt be compensated because theyll be compensated notnessary materialistically they will be on then when they are expected they will be compensated somewhere but the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing wha ge what is what is ini for me what is in it for you is intangible are you willing

oh i do not really think so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i do not i guess i do not i do not get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i do not yell and scream atam am i man realize they did not ask to have a learning disability i mean and that they can not they are some teachers think they are just being belligerent and if they want to straighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they can not change their learning disability any more you change your brown eyes you know they were born with it it is genetic some one else n their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach ito different way t is like teachin to mouth proben two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of em might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say an you say turn a page three ninety three or they turn to three thirty nine in their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i always tell teachers if you could just walk for one day in their shoes you probably have a lot of ampathy for them

adoption is different i think though that when adoption is entirely different than when you conceive somebody else is spirm or somebody else is whatever a because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here gin you are reaching out to your friend your neighbor you are not just forgetting about i and let the wellfare someb take care of im and let him go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is andand you are really accepting this responsibuilityn that is lup and when you are trying and willing to have well some people wuld probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside on me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what jeans they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not later on you will find out but istill you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are goin to be able to trace these jeans back and say you kno later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and can find itt and help the child better

when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found the jeffersons offensive in many ways cause it was sterea typical and made fun oofof black people an many ways in retrospect it was tren setting and what it did not and even in putting blacks in ah advertisements on t v young kids saw them and saw those adds and saw those t v programmes and so it became a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it bebecomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those t v programmes and think they were tren setting instead of stereal typical ah bi am sure it does have a some influence cause i think it did it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepard helped also

actually there they are working on it i am sorry don mean tontrutya a they have they have a am just in stated some bono schemes were as the poverty lat level i think is considered them thirteen thousand pounds a year a and if if you are below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonous beyond yo so there is a bonus for back to work you mention earlier about like how this would affect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system theyare for for whatever reason than i do about the sitem here which ju kind of unfortunate but a there i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow i as i should be and who who really need it and who really you nw takin care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like theyr kids see none of that money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered you know and you know those you know lot o theyre they are document trees on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your fhace than it is here that i ever noticed am but i do think an and with that they have specific programms for the children and a i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if if a kit has bad behaviour or you know bad attendants that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighbourhood shop lifting boing you know hot wiring cars at the age of yo now ten or something and i do not know i think i do have a sort of very strong opinions about people you know who having all these kids and do not take care of them at all

ahm not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage a are gong to go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually it isthis is te very hot topic in england right now because they are they have got the highest rate of teen age pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condems on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing they are there you know they can go in and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think its pretty important just you know because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be you know its thafe about it 

Recording: (7274/ 8002) 
beause then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to help themselves and like the parents obviously that even if they are working lot at times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children bease how many accidents happen to children like people always breakin arms and stuff

civil rights um well i take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion um yathey are on paper which is a good thing cause it was a terrible thing when er there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating and equal in fair society maybe som my leftes positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where whe are in the social stratum you are born in the united states i you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these classnan i do not want to say class lines because that has so many like historical comnetations case it is not the exact same as they class was in the markses sense but class lines still to day very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in real terms in things i think we are valuable to the individual

Recording: (7755/ 8002) 
i mean the money you know the money is great you know find it is the biggest rays they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as cause the signing boness was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that yous start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to maint campas you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the rays and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on maink campas and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget and you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems an this and that and they are thirty five million in the whole cause theyve bougtow as you east and all this but you know it is not the union is fault that they ran out the contract you know you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wageis so low that it is hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten and the nation or whatever is furnishing but they are not willng to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always going to have to have people here tocause contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up to day and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order
