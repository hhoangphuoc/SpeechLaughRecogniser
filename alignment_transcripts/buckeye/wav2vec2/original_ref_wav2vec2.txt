yes but there is nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured something weird is going on i did not know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce related just basically dumb because the divorce was not going to faze me because the entire marriage was we knew we knew from the beginning it was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so we are just kind of waiting around going oh they are gonna be divorced in a couple months and sure enough so anyway um so i i look at these people and their names are the and so the are coming forward with two police officers behind them and mister is kind of a large gentleman and he is way too somber for this experience and if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce i am going to give you some sort of shit for it and at the same time um mrs used to be a principal of mine elementary school

Recording: (22/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (23/ 8002) 
well i one thing uh you know being uh uh i came from basically a poor poor uh uh lifestyle uh early life and everything you know so uh um if anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh towards people that had an influence had money and did not do any thing good with it you know i am a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what i preach but you know that is i would be a good philosophy to live by uh and people of other religions and everything um you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raised baptist basically but uh i practice more catholic than anything else now uh but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and everything just because i find it interesting 

Recording: (24/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (25/ 8002) 
friend who her name was she is not really a friend she was a teacher when i was in college her name was mrs cozy and she got pregnant she said everybody said she came in one day and said it is a girl it is a girl i found out it is a girl what are you gonna name her rosie rosie cozy you have got to be kidding she said i am just putting you on oh 

Recording: (26/ 8002) 
yeah but the ones that they really needed to do like two well like seventy one and seventy i mean that i do not it is a bottle neck area you know and they really should have done something with that twenty years ago you know 

Recording: (27/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (28/ 8002) 
umhum plus you get so many different students and what i like just walking over here today you know it is kind of thought you know i wonder how many of these people i walk by you know are gonna be here in january because you know a lot of because i did you know i thought well this is cool man you know 

Recording: (29/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (30/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (31/ 8002) 
yeah but it was just so funny you know i know we talked too long but this is so much fun 

Recording: (32/ 8002) 
it was a nice birthday party 

Recording: (33/ 8002) 
unit does it um and it was not that i had a bad family unit it was just that there was not you know we never talked about it my SISTER AND were just talking about that because wewere she goes we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and what not she goes you do not mom and dad handed me a book i am like they did 

Recording: (34/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (35/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (36/ 8002) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were gay okay were they gay before but they did like women 

Recording: (37/ 8002) 
only the can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that the people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in a you know in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are they are to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it but yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents did not were clueless i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes in to a garage every night and you hear clanging and and they are buying gun metal and you know then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a site on the internet 

Recording: (38/ 8002) 
i do know a few people that are gay um but they are in their thirties 

Recording: (39/ 8002) 
we have the time 

Recording: (40/ 8002) 
uh huh 

Recording: (41/ 8002) 
i mean if we were that racist of a city then we would not be that accepting to gay pride marches and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back 

Recording: (42/ 8002) 
i do not think it is i do not think it is really affected me i mean obviously there is more places to go shopping or to eat or you there is more traffic LAUGH I do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other it and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool i went to public school 

Recording: (43/ 8002) 
umhum yeah umhum yeah 

Recording: (44/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (45/ 8002) 
yeah he is not getting that i do not think he is getting that learning he is he is more his uh that is his grandmother you know watching him and you know i wish that she would like do more of the learning things that the day cares do do you know but 

Recording: (46/ 8002) 
it is so funny that is what my daughters i do we are then we are always looking and saying hmm there could do this this this this yeah and plus 

Recording: (47/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i did not have back problems or anything like that but it was just like the feeling it was like i am not right 

Recording: (48/ 8002) 
well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (49/ 8002) 
well yeah it is i just give you a rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here 

Recording: (50/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (51/ 8002) 
what department 

Recording: (52/ 8002) 
hate crime is a is an is an interesting term um all crimes all murders are hate related i uh i am not sure it that is uh it it is difficult i we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was uh in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism um and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime and you know are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a a law on the books so i do not think we need to have a hate crime over and above that you know uh the the people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it is going to turn people against uh gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury convict white men of of killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (53/ 8002) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (54/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (55/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (56/ 8002) 
is 

Recording: (57/ 8002) 
eighty eight so we we just had our eleventh wedding anniversary yeah 

Recording: (58/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (59/ 8002) 
he would be lost 

Recording: (60/ 8002) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so it is kind of like the small town thing which would have goods and bads but i do not know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with it is still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and a lot of participation in that and so 

Recording: (61/ 8002) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about are on tv or radio or via telephone or whatever 

Recording: (62/ 8002) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not wanna stay on it i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know i thought 

Recording: (63/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> uh huh 

Recording: (64/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (65/ 8002) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the honking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a a debate about it but it we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (66/ 8002) 
right right but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute you know uh <LAUGH> ITS so obvious hello <LAUGH> but <LAUGH> oh yeah 

Recording: (67/ 8002) 
very very much so now twenty fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would call we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are no longer a democratic government as defined back there then uh yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition of this developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (68/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (69/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (70/ 8002) 
and walks away 

Recording: (71/ 8002) 
because of the gay activism 

Recording: (72/ 8002) 
um he moved to texas because like he was moving into like the he was going to s m u there and like so i moved back from florida back to up up here because i did not wanna i did not wanna go with because texas is terrible and like um so then like my mom see like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (73/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (74/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (75/ 8002) 
since march too 

Recording: (76/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (77/ 8002) 
because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialists than they are capitalists and they are easier to deal with and they are more reasonable people in my OPINION MUCH MORE REASONABLE but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and and all i am the minority in my family <LAUGH> BELIEVE ME <LAUGH> and uh they are very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (78/ 8002) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in virginia beach so 

Recording: (79/ 8002) 
and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in the columbus coated fabrics plant which is plant that makes coated fabrics they make uh the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and there is fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (80/ 8002) 
does not that mean make 

Recording: (81/ 8002) 
no i 

Recording: (82/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (83/ 8002) 
umhum i do not know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was called a lot of little things <LAUGH> 

Recording: (84/ 8002) 
you know a historic building they are like oh there is no history in america YKNOW 

Recording: (85/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (86/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (87/ 8002) 
right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months sober and he worked every day 

Recording: (88/ 8002) 
yeah so it she is funny because she is gained twenty six pounds and yet she does not look pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today 

Recording: (89/ 8002) 
i have never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women are not priests is because they do not show any kind of uh spiritual leadership i i have never heard that said and there must be people who think that 

Recording: (90/ 8002) 
that they just do not have those 

Recording: (91/ 8002) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (92/ 8002) 
uh but if you love the if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not gonna let get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but and i love you dearly but i try to teach you differently i do not know where you went wrong i do not know what i did wrong whatever but you gotta pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere uh but now you said family yes i think the reason and that at our age we look back everyone was born and everyone was loved by a father and by a when they were little and how their formative years are and the education the um the way they were uh taught as they were growing up does help them to become what that president is what that any politician is any minister or anybody else it the way you are raised i firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it bears on everybody so that is why it really begins with the family 

Recording: (93/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (94/ 8002) 
okay uh i have been in columbus since nineteen seventy seven and uh i am an air traffic controller and i have three more days to work before i retire i am i i i am retiring sunday so and tomorrow is my retirement dinner so uh a little nervous about what i have to do there you know they have told me nothing except show up 

Recording: (95/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (96/ 8002) 
so the state would pay for it 

Recording: (97/ 8002) 
oh okay <LAUGH> oh okay so 

Recording: (98/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (99/ 8002) 
no my mom uh she is not an invalid uh she is seventy two years old but they go out usually to yard sales stuff like that stuff i do not wanna do 

Recording: (100/ 8002) 
so be it you know we had the out there helping out the the g i is fine team effort was not it but then after g i is came home the little lady went back in to the house and business all these idle lines say hey we can do something here because in those days the little lady said well i will go out and get a little odd job uh we want a little thing mom would do pick up a little extra things here and so forth dad was a primary breadwinner but she would go out and do some odd jobs just to compliment their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit and now i mean i am jumping ahead of myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (101/ 8002) 
oh yeah and and i i will probably step on your toes here but i i am not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in daycare and uh you know after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i would like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie we will just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go we will be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (102/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> especially why you know we try at at five in the morning <LAUGH> 

Recording: (103/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (104/ 8002) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (105/ 8002) 
oh yeah that is beautiful yeah 

Recording: (106/ 8002) 
and she said she would get back to me on it well never heard nothing from her and she is done that to me i do not know how many times 

Recording: (107/ 8002) 
um when i went i went with my friend 

Recording: (108/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (109/ 8002) 
um so i just came down here then 

Recording: (110/ 8002) 
i love ohio state but i do not i i guess from a career perspective they say it is not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but 

Recording: (111/ 8002) 
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if i slept at night instead of staying up 

Recording: (112/ 8002) 
really and people use do people use them 

Recording: (113/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (114/ 8002) 
so therefore they can they are not public they can put whatever they want 

Recording: (115/ 8002) 
right well here is here is a can of manwich it is a dollar fifty and we will give you fifty cents off well gee if i just use the recipe out the microwave cookbook i can make it at home for like three cents but but you know why it is convenience i can throw it in the microwave and it will be done in five minutes you know like mashed potatoes the microwave or you know it is like hello it is you know i i can understand how people do it because they come home from work and it is like i do not want to be a cook i do not want to be a clean up so i will pay somebody do this pay somebody do that and pretty soon you see all the money they have been making gone 

Recording: (116/ 8002) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (117/ 8002) 
oh my my sister is religious and that that tends to warp her view of everything 

Recording: (118/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (119/ 8002) 
uh he was a uh railroad clerk 

Recording: (120/ 8002) 
yeah and we are ONE OF THEM <LAUGH> texas is supporting strong they have like 

Recording: (121/ 8002) 
thought about it i have come home get in the car and go out go somewhere you know or come home get something to eat and yeah that was about it i ah but i think that has a lot to do with it um i do not really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching howdy doody and all that stuff and course it was not the uh violent stuff maybe that you can see on tv now or uh but i do not really think the media just has not had that much to do with it it is just a different time now uh i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know with uh uh the vietnamese guy uh vietcong guy getting his brains blowed out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out and um want to do that you know so if anything it made me want not want to do it you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army and uh when i got my notice he is like three years older than me you know and he is so i mean it do not they will draft you they will put you on the front line i said well i am going to enlist in the airforce anyway so 

Recording: (122/ 8002) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emory and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (123/ 8002) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (124/ 8002) 
they were not even allowed to believe in god 

Recording: (125/ 8002) 
i am really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me that is like okay come on i do not really want i do not want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff i just wanna get going and do the rest of this STUFF so 

Recording: (126/ 8002) 
yeah plus i mean you <LAUGH> save a lot of money too i mean 

Recording: (127/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (128/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (129/ 8002) 
man i would like to go out there overseas somewhere 

Recording: (130/ 8002) 
i thought it was very strange but um 

Recording: (131/ 8002) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (132/ 8002) 
like 

Recording: (133/ 8002) 
i have lived 

Recording: (134/ 8002) 
yeah it is it is nice it works out well 

Recording: (135/ 8002) 
you were you had to go home because mother was ill 

Recording: (136/ 8002) 
that and i imagine that is about half and half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is uh in evolution at this time tell you the truth what is gonna cause the world to end i think what they really mean by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there is a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very but it is very very hard thing to accomplish especially when you have gotten into this like he said me me me and i gotta have this and that status symbol stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in my own home i have been a collector now i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time when he was out of work guess what i do not know what welfare agency it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first doll baby i ever had and i remember when i uh tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water and when my mother said well if you do not know how to take care of any better than that i will never buy you another one and believe me she did not 

Recording: (137/ 8002) 
yep yep there is a big water area it is something to do with the little mermaid or whatever but they really enjoy all that we try to do as much as we can with them outdoor type of thing we do a lot of camping we do a lot of vacationing we try to go two times a year at least uh her parents live in cape cod so they 

Recording: (138/ 8002) 
uh to we never used the word EVER <LAUGH> but um i am sure plenty of people used the word ON US YOU KNOW <LAUGH> but we uh we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but um in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would <LAUGH> GO ALONG WITH HER YKNOW but um if a if a we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would very and i then in the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life it was 

Recording: (139/ 8002) 
we start them over again they have never learned and reason why you are throwing out carrying out too much in front of them without saying hey you gotta do this to prove this to me no we we we lack uh one heck a lot of ethical moral standards in this country we are losing it every day and until we start looking at ourselves in in the mirror at night and say i am proud of myself i am proud of what i did i may not have made a dollar today but i understood somebody today 

Recording: (140/ 8002) 
but <LAUGH> 

Recording: (141/ 8002)

Recording: (190/ 8002) 
no because i know people that are married do not take care their kids 

Recording: (191/ 8002) 
once they turn into adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (192/ 8002) 
it is like big deal you know common sense it is hot you do not put it in a sensitive area while you are driving to work um but she sued for ten million and the papers said she won ten million she did not i mean after that ten million award was given by a jury then the uh mcdonald is is allowed a an appeal at the end of a year so she does not see any money for a year and that is if they do not appeal but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (193/ 8002) 
yeah he is the father definitely 

Recording: (194/ 8002) 
well you know it because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know it did not cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy 

Recording: (195/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (196/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (197/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (198/ 8002) 
i do not know that is kind of a tricky question really because on one hand obviously the kid definitely WILL get uh made fun of and teased and things like that 

Recording: (199/ 8002) 
and i have heard the thing you know you are not my real father and all that we went through all that 

Recording: (200/ 8002) 
yeah and uh and a lot of performing arts you were expected to take something in performing and visual arts every year uh which is good for him the catholic school he was going to go to was big on sports and my son is not athletic and so this was that is why he did not wanna go so this this was a good choice for him or that yeah uh i do not know um yeah well um i think the teachers are every bit as good as dedicated but i think there seems to be uh the whole administration up through the board and just it is not as focused ya know i do not know how to describe it is like the teachers are sort of it seemed like they almost had the feeling they are on their own where it is more cohesive within the catholic schools like that seems to be very clear they are all going in the same direction and working as a team i do not know if you ever listened to any of the uh columbus board of education meetings are on the radio 

Recording: (201/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (202/ 8002)

Recording: (207/ 8002) 
uh my stepmother is 

Recording: (208/ 8002) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not gonna condemn them um at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out that maybe that child um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student ensemble um uh it would be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way um just because if you are gonna teach it to um a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them probably be making cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (209/ 8002) 
my sister is last name is goodnight and when she had her first little girl she said she was gonna name her dawn ann goodnight but she did not she did not

Recording: (225/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (226/ 8002) 
but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (227/ 8002) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you are listening to them uh some people i do not care what their age was they just blew them off uh and so that plus you have they i think a understanding of um the schooling they came from um 

Recording: (228/ 8002) 
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that had not been kept up 

Recording: (229/ 8002) 
no not often uh my daughter has a very um intense life <LAUGH> and uh so um i do not see them near as often as i like right we just do a one day thing because it is fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go real early in the morning and uh spend six or seven hours with them and then come back and or she does the same thing she comes down here and we just do the one day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah BLAH YOU KNOW SO it is better to stick home so i know what they are doing and everything but i do not i am not the old fashioned grandmother 

Recording: (230/ 8002) 
and 

Recording: (231/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (232/ 8002) 
i guess 

Recording: (233/ 8002) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh um not so much um the the type of work that i do but i think she is very charitable very giving very um 

Recording: (234/ 8002) 
it is been a i it is been a remarkably well i mean i have not had any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and and uh i had a checkup and my doctor he thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound well the thing is they did this ultrasound they did not find anything so which was really kinda creepy because they did not know because there is that whole tubule pregnancy thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did my ultrasound was not my regular doctor and he is kind of little he is just a little abrupt for me and he says well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you could die and all this stuff and i said wait a minute i am not ready for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is gone really well i mean uh i just i and i know we just finished our lamaze classes last night and there were some women in there they are huge i mean these girls can not even get off the floor and i just feel really BAD FOR THEM SO for me it is it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems 

Recording: (235/ 8002) 
um they did briefly like cover thingslikethatwith like religion and health classes things likethat 

Recording: (236/ 8002) 
yeah it ai not gonna change though 

Recording: (237/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (238/ 8002) 
well it was both really because there is kids lived there since i lived there that was thirteen years ago huh and being that long in the same neighborhood just does not really get it with me 

Recording: (239/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (240/ 8002) 
she is okay right 

Recording: (241/ 8002) 
and we could do what we wanted <LAUGH> 

Recording: (242/ 8002) 
when i first you know got a divorce so it is been hard 

Recording: (243/ 8002) 
yeah <LAUGH> or you could do the university of oregon it is a very nice very small university but it is nice 

Recording: (244/ 8002) 
to which i had a conversationwithher about it said you know you did not cause anything you know me and your mother caused it all if anything you werethebrightest spot of the whole marriage so and that is where you got to look at yourself when you see that reflection in the mirror remember that you know 

Recording: (245/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (246/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (247/ 8002) 
sexuality at all 

Recording: (248/ 8002) 
her forceful personality too 

Recording: (249/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (250/ 8002) 
oh it was on saturday 

Recording: (251/ 8002) 
well you know my and my girls there are certain products that brand name like uh one of them i know is the meijer uh pudding that you can uh take for lunches which they do and it is like edventure you know adventure but it is edventure well every once in while hunts will be the same price and they will be a coupon in the paper so joyce will or joyce or i we we trade she goes the grocery store once then next two weeks i go and the next two weeks she goes so um she will uh you know she will buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes and i go why are you buying that and she goes it was cheaper than the meijer brand and then when we eat it it is like it is too sweet you know or it is too overpowering or too sugary and the girls even they the same way they would go we do not like this it is too chocolatey so you know like the manwich stuff it is like they just pour sugar in it i guess because that is what people like and so i find that the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but it is all like a meijer brand or something like that or food club or something like that 

Recording: (252/ 8002) 
well i think sometimes that it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never told my kids not to do something that i myself was doing examples smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner saying no you are not old enough but i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age that somebody can at another age possibly like go out on a date for example well he is going out that party why can not i well he is already sixteen years old now wait till you are sixteen years old and you will be allowed to go to parties because by that time i will expect you be able you know know what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and i know <LAUGH> well i will not give you any examples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try my swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl uh but anyway i would always and i would apologize if they did catch me doing something that i have been telling them no you cannot do i would apologize say mommy was bad and mommy did that i got soap in my mouth one TIME BECAUSE I DID THAT <LAUGH> well well um oh no i mean now if you want to hear the story it is funny well deviate just a teeny bit i was baking a pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie one those that can get juicy sometimes and i had not put any aluminum foil or anything underneath there to catch it and just as i started to get it out i spilled it and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here here is two little shoes <LAUGH> 

Recording: (253/ 8002) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously england is such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me and but it is true i mean the fact that you know the access is just there is almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of you know in conversation talking about oh yeah i you know getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like you know what your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (254/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (255/ 8002) 
but it is a lot would you say it is a uh say it is a nice place to visit but you would not wanna live there or would you actually live there 

Recording: (256/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> when okay when they um when that song came out you would probably hear it at least twelve times a day on some of those radio stations and it got so i just <LAUGH> I cannot stand this i can not stand it 

Recording: (257/ 8002) 
think what 

Recording: (258/ 8002) 
as uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something <LAUGH> she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were 

Recording: (259/ 8002) 
oh okay 

Recording: (260/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (261/ 8002) 
yeah meet different people 

Recording: (262/ 8002) 
yeah she is ALREADY <LAUGH> i did not think she would have it any other way 

Recording: (263/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (264/ 8002) 
yeah <LAUGH> i do not really have any childhood recollections of california yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (265/ 8002) 
no because um all the kids take that california achievement test i do not know if you are familiar with that and it is like you know because it is say like you and i go to school you go to you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus and we both make straight a is well when you take the california achievement test that really the a is mean nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those because you know they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh it is so look how bad their test scores well you know if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i do not know what it what it would be but lets just say it is uh brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad in probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so they live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not a uh you know like an ogre or anything but you know i always keep tabs on my kids you know like i have always gone to conferences even though they got straight a is i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like saying i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand a is i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is a c then that is what it will be but i said if your best is an a and you are getting a c you got me to talk to so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a is and when they take the um what is that thing the proficiency test zoom through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have uh this probably sounds really biased or bigoted but then you have the kid whose mom and dad are not together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes proficiency test he gets like a th=thirty 

Recording: (266/ 8002) 
oh it will be 

Recording: (267/ 8002) 
no where north land is 

Recording: (268/ 8002) 
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or the other 

Recording: (269/ 8002) 
i my my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the auditorium and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it is reached the point that is decision is made and announced and i mean there were good reasons for it um and they explained the reasons and ya know at some point you have to figure out how much do you wanna fight something when it is inevitable 

Recording: (270/ 8002) 
the mustiness the old 

Recording: (271/ 8002) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (272/ 8002) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they did not know i was gonna do this so after they get all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no ad libbing no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote 

Recording: (273/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (274/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (275/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> you played saxophone in the band 

Recording: (276/ 8002) 
and none of the other coaches did either 

Recording: (277/ 8002) 
and so it was kind of funny but but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (278/ 8002) 
yeah well yeah yeah i mean it happened a lot and um i have had two abortions one illegal and one legal and 

Recording: (279/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (280/ 8002) 
oh george oh w i do not know i have not really formed an opinion i can not 

Recording: (281/ 8002) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot 

Recording: (282/ 8002) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid is gonna hate you 

Recording: (283/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (284/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (285/ 8002) 
like i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 

Recording: (286/ 8002) 
yeah they are very quantitative as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well they will in my opinion they will end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover things like that then and if you have a product and that because obviously people are not gonna care you know so and they they are they seem very closedminded like like this is the way business has to be but the professors do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (287/ 8002) 
they did not they did not bring that up he only gave ten cents 

Recording: (288/ 8002) 
now what that is industrial nuclearonics or something like that think about now you got the wetlands down there you know where are kids gonna go 

Recording: (289/ 8002) 
TAKE THEM TO THE grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but and i do not do it as regularly now because of the advance in age you know 

Recording: (290/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (291/ 8002) 
well is there any kind of you know training i mean do you are they doing like the whole job training after the two years or during the two years 

Recording: (292/ 8002) 
so they are kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent that is kind of how it is divided out between the projects 

Recording: (293/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (294/ 8002) 
yeah

Recording: (303/ 8002) 
like it is like we are taking catalog orders over the phone it is not a really a big deal like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us we are suppose to wear collared shirts and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they too they yell at like and i if like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we could not hug they were like no it is like you can not hug in here or something like that they were like it takes away from the professional attitude it is like i do not even know what to say to people like that like it is just like such a different like 

Recording: (304/ 8002) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good set i my my best friend is a realtor uh she is since retired but it is so funny because she would always go through all these statistics and this and that because it the stuff i have done is in and and because i live in area and so she would say oh i do not know and she would say well how much do you have to get it for and how much should and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can sell it for a hundred and forty if i do this this this and this now you are gonna put a lot of money into that though it is not like you are you are still only gonna make maybe ten thousand dollars profit but um and she would say well i do not know and for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea and finally she says oh well rachel i do not know it always works out for you you always get that so just do it and it is just some intuition kind of thing 

Recording: (305/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (306/ 8002) 
i do not that i think that that what they were protesting was that they were not being involved in it was not that part of their protest 

Recording: (307/ 8002) 
hm 

Recording: (308/ 8002) 
they ai not gonna lock me up 

Recording: (309/ 8002) 
yeah it basically feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes exorbitantly high i mean they it is a little higher but yeah it it is not ridiculously high 

Recording: (310/ 8002) 
oh yes they are getting better though they really are they are much better now than they were twenty years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example 

Recording: (311/ 8002) 
you consider the housing trends and there there again that goes back to the stupid consumer i say stupid consumer because when i was in college i always said well consumer had a fourth grade education level 

Recording: (312/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> they cannot understand where you are coming from 

Recording: (313/ 8002)

Recording: (318/ 8002) 
i think that would be perfect 

Recording: (319/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (320/ 8002) 
i i used to kinda worry about the effect that tv had on me um i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv i would come home from school and plop myself in front of the tv and watch i like you know four cartoons back to back or so everyday after school or i that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be uh a block of you know from six in the morning until afternoon or something these days i do not watch nearly that much tv um i do not buy these arguments that people make that say that like children are like like violence in tv is affecting children i mean i i have seen some evidence of of exercises where in schools the kids will watch uh like a a violent cartoon like i do not know like roadrunner or something and then be a little rougher but i i do not think that it it goes into like values i do not associate like rising crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i i mean it if there is a correlation i mean i i am more of the you know like parents have a greater influence on the children then tv ever could i mean i watched a lot tv but i feel that my parents taught me was right and wrong and i watched a lot of rather violent tv violent movies all that kinda thing and uh um 

Recording: (321/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (322/ 8002) 
nope not my not my area if it is hot in here <LAUGH>

Recording: (327/ 8002) 
no humans are violent by nature i believe mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it is more or less greed that causes violence it is not media media just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do tv is showing you violence that you could do if you are driven to it 

Recording: (328/ 8002) 
and you can hit the road if you want of course the only thing he had was nothing 

Recording: (329/ 8002) 
where it took me to 

Recording: (330/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (331/ 8002) 
yeah those are nice 

Recording: (332/ 8002) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something i do not wanna deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean two people of the same sex are living together married or whatnot that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot it is i think it is just more because it is so different than like what you NORMALLY SEE OR things like that 

Recording: (333/ 8002) 
uh she is grown uh uh she yeah she is expanded her horizons if you will and 

Recording: (334/ 8002) 
and uh as with a lot of the resentment that is felt that i experienced toward americans rather saddeningly i think our culture is starting to really infuse itself into europe at least i mean i see instead of us becoming more like them you know them becoming more like us walmart has bought you know a big uh retailer there so 

Recording: (335/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (336/ 8002)

Recording: (338/ 8002) 
no with the system 

Recording: (339/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (340/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (341/ 8002)

Recording: (343/ 8002) 
gotten somewhere else 

Recording: (344/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (345/ 8002) 
none of it i mean it is kind of the traditional light at the um uh uh like a big tunnel with a bright light at the end or uh they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene uh um seeing a dead relative something like that 

Recording: (346/ 8002) 
been highly critical of of organized religion 

Recording: (347/ 8002) 
no it is very much so 

Recording: (348/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (349/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (350/ 8002) 
that is right 

Recording: (351/ 8002)

Recording: (354/ 8002)

Recording: (355/ 8002) 
for alcohol like on your breath at all 

Recording: (356/ 8002) 
and so you keep thinking well you know they need more but i was hoping they could use that land for something else i do not know there is you know there is so many not building but you know something maybe especially in dublin but it is i it is probably it will be good for columbus 

Recording: (357/ 8002) 
okay

hm 

Recording: (359/ 8002)

i do not like BUSSING <LAUGH> i just do not um i think it is it is kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (361/ 8002) 
well i think in general like let us say if you took a handful of executives from borden or a t and t or someplace like that you would probably find that in general they are very concerned 

Recording: (362/ 8002) 
yeah but um just to see the church might be fun um we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worship center building and because we were really too too big for the sanctuary that we had 

Recording: (363/ 8002) 
no i do not fear none of the kids 

Recording: (364/ 8002) 
you know they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and that is that is the bottom line and it is sad but there is so i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we ended up settling for 

Recording: (365/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (366/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (367/ 8002)

Recording: (376/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (377/ 8002) 
which one is that 

Recording: (378/ 8002) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she is going to have the rest of her life um i will tell you what with today is world and some of these fourteen year olds that look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and no they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age seventeen maybe you know i think they should have a parent is consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it is going to be if she is gonna be young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you know and there is so much that for a while there that was going on and it is like you i can not believe these women are doing this you know they just snap <LAUGH> 

Recording: (379/ 8002)

Recording: (681/ 8002) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and the what is in your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being um shown and and have access to 

Recording: (682/ 8002) 
hm 

Recording: (683/ 8002) 
um hum

Recording: (686/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (687/ 8002)

Recording: (689/ 8002) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my in fact i have been happy about them lately because um i have well we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents say they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to they spend a week with my brother etc etc and they come here a couple times a year and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times in twenty years and that is because they do not wanna get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in in akron and masillon and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfield with my sisters and they will not do it because it is just to they do not wanna have to deal with that traffic they do not like that and it is and just recently i finally said you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually called them i am fifty two 

Recording: (690/ 8002) 
somewhat 

Recording: (691/ 8002) 
umhum yeah yeah if it is a nice day on the weekends i

Recording: (693/ 8002) 
oh <LAUGH> 

Recording: (694/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (695/ 8002) 
yeah yeah they they all of them there is actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look but as you said there is little details that are different and 

Recording: (696/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (697/ 8002) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not think that you can say everything you know you have everybody has do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that in to consideration i think so 

Recording: (698/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (699/ 8002) 
she believes no man will love you so much not to cheat and i do not believe that so i am not with her son <LAUGH>

uh it is not really an office he is like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and and then he gets to um talk with the the other contractors and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites 

Recording: (701/ 8002) 
he is gonna he is gonna be there all summer you know i did not decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner um and found out that when i checked the web site for the scanner that they are just simply flat out not making windows two thousand drivers for my scanner so it is a um crap i do not know i just got it i can not even remember what it is um paper port i think it is paper port avoid windows two thousand at all costs stick with ninety eight much better much better operating system <LAUGH> 

Recording: (702/ 8002) 
they are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (703/ 8002) 
and she is taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctor is uh orders and she is very careful what she eats and 

Recording: (704/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (705/ 8002) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (706/ 8002) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like what do they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures all are different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or do you know what i mean that that is something different um accept the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (707/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (708/ 8002) 
i think it is important to know what the person is values an customs are and to support whatever it is an if i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed uh face the north star or uh they needed to have this thing above the bed or under the bed and i mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (709/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (710/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (711/ 8002) 
but it is not gonna work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peer is opinions because i i for one example the pokemon craze my son did not know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh it is cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean <LAUGH> you know what i mean because it is like now they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was not cool so that was my our influence on him rather than the peer is influence on him 

Recording: (712/ 8002) 
um hum hum hum 

Recording: (713/ 8002)

i that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not WORK IN WAYS THAT OTHER people is do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real lot more temperamental we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things are not um even tempered are not things you would use to describe me but but not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have gotten older too i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important anymore

as a teacher how would you how could you cut down a student and say no that is not the way it was and it is nothing you are learning from a teacher is guide no but how do you know if i ask in the first but it is a matter of tradition of handing it down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way and it is it is not necessarily written down but it is passed on those days probably written down or not written down but verbal and extended and so it is that hand down from generation 

Recording: (924/ 8002)

Recording: (1035/ 8002) 
and that is the way i felt about it not i am not saying that that is not a possibility but 

Recording: (1036/ 8002) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of a government telling me what to do 

Recording: (1037/ 8002) 
yeah most them think the freshman class just ride along i think the freshmen would be little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to be walking around knowing different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million halls around me and just stopped once and i said where is lazenby and they that way not too far from where i parked

he says i did not 

Recording: (1044/ 8002) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (1045/ 8002) 
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he is a bigot TOO <LAUGH> a racist yeah so 

Recording: (1046/ 8002) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your costs and then there is the percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just not it is really not that hard 

Recording: (1047/ 8002) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (1048/ 8002) 
WELL YEAH 

Recording: (1049/ 8002) 
actually i do was not even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her oh this sounds cool you know i had thought of myself as a uh a chemist for a long time and that this opportunity came up yeah i would applied to like other places and i got into university of chicago and i wanted to go there and then this came up here and also i mean it is just ridiculously cheaper here i did not want debt after UNDERGRAD that is just pathetic um my counselor just kind of found it and he would posted it and he specially um tried to notify the national merit people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princeton right now you know and they are all off at their ivy leagues like basically working their butts off to get in when i am already in i do not totally understand it 

Recording: (1050/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (1051/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1052/ 8002) 
i never learned math <LAUGH> we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables he had a big pizza party planned for 

Recording: (1053/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (1054/ 8002) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (1055/ 8002) 
no no i am i am interested 

Recording: (1056/ 8002) 
um i think uh some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i STILL GO through that i think we all go through that at some point or other even yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind eye i think that is part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your child is eyes you need to really admit it um i mean you do not wanna do that but 

Recording: (1057/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (1058/ 8002) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home

yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky TO RUN across her 

Recording: (1061/ 8002) 
and they are not accurate 

Recording: (1062/ 8002) 
even harder 

Recording: (1063/ 8002) 
which i think is kinda nice so i it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just wanna have a room to all myself you know i do not wanna go some place where i am gonna HAVE to like deal with SOMEBODY ELSE IN THERE so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home 

Recording: (1064/ 8002) 
so she is very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that uh so she is basically disabled and that goes when they do that it is because of your education and also they take into consideration and everything 

Recording: (1065/ 8002) 
really umhum i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (1066/ 8002) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is it is just columbus it is just columbus ah maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here um do not realize how it i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not SAN FRANSICO there is a lot of places it is not but it is ah you know it is not a backwater either well they need to get out more <LAUGH> I MEAN you know all this oh we will never be a major league city until we have major league sports well you know i guess um getting out more would not help those PEOPLE it is um ah that that would be you know that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and um i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i would i am i really do think people do not take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (1067/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (1068/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1069/ 8002)

Recording: (1070/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1071/ 8002) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait till they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman

yeah and it is like number one in the union and that is like such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone is life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent you know 

Recording: (1108/ 8002) 
yes hopefully 

Recording: (1109/ 8002) 
and one of them they would looked at in columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well gifted children you have the high uh one of the highest drop rate of out rates in schools they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this moneys uh my feeling is you know there is lot of programs in school there is sponsored by the federal government particularly uh to help the the students are that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (1110/ 8002) 
when they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars that will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it 

Recording: (1111/ 8002) 
you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it is gonna be the one that runs the show well then that is when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm 

Recording: (1112/ 8002) 
sure um i grew up in lima ohio and which is only about an hour and half from here north i came here in nineteen ninety one i believe here being columbus um i got married about three years ago and right now i am in the process of doing a little bit of everything i have worked all my life um until about the past two years and i have just been working like part time and um doing crafts and things like that because i have always been like in the financial analytical end and the other side of my brain wants some work 

Recording: (1113/ 8002) 
so we DID IT it is well he is always had some problems it is um his problem is staying focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can not get him away from it um if it is something he it is the just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or working on a writing assignment or something and half hour to work on it he would be the last five minutes the teacher say you know you really need to get that done he would sit down and write it the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and he would could do it that quickly um i think he is lost ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade the school he went to was an open classroom and uh he had been through some couple the traditional schools already and the principal said we had told the talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him staying focused and she said well we can work with that well about halfway through the year she says it is not working and they have an arrangement and with and i doubt if most the people in the parents in the school are even aware of this with childrens hospital the counseling center they set a room aside and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students it is open classroom it is experimental so there is people coming and going all the time and no but how we were never aware of it i i doubt if most the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him and he was they were the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about and said he was the counselors said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but if came time to answer the questions he knew every answer so he said he that they decided not to precede at that time because this is frustrating too it was our wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week but that was unusual and he was not a bad kid

oh yeah that was a that was a job helping them to move 

Recording: (1160/ 8002)

Recording: (1161/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1162/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 8002)

Recording: (1164/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (1165/ 8002) 
okay okay 

Recording: (1166/ 8002) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them yeah 

Recording: (1167/ 8002) 
and those the and the other students were lost to the system and that is what happened with him 

Recording: (1168/ 8002) 
umhum yeah because i could not imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (1169/ 8002) 
you know even republicans are like that 

Recording: (1170/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1171/ 8002) 
no no no but 

Recording: (1172/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1173/ 8002) 
em aw that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (1174/ 8002) 
janet we just had a man who took time to 

Recording: (1175/ 8002) 
oh okay 

Recording: (1176/ 8002) 
are they but they all look alike 

Recording: (1177/ 8002) 
uh they uh stopped federally funding uh o s u that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people moved like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years til i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to uproot my daughters out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (1178/ 8002) 
so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i i would uh call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (1179/ 8002) 
i try to be as much as possible too i think it it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (1180/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (1181/ 8002) 
um oh 

Recording: (1182/ 8002) 
well and 

Recording: (1183/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1184/ 8002) 
its the way i feel 

Recording: (1185/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (1186/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1187/ 8002) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (1188/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1189/ 8002) 
she figures well you know that kind of makes up for me not working so 

Recording: (1190/ 8002) 
uhhuh <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1191/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1192/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (1193/ 8002) 
you are talking to people all over the country and i mean you are becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world and 

Recording: (1194/ 8002) 
oh my god 

Recording: (1195/ 8002) 
and they were in italy and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from from where i was probably is a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1196/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (1197/ 8002) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child and every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms you know so they are gonna make that decision on their own i say just and and plus with the internet and everything they they have access to so much information and i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are gonna be a parent you need to be RESPONSIBLE and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (1198/ 8002) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (1199/ 8002) 
um up until march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home an then my grandfather who is ninety five got um ill and my aunt had to choose between my son and my grandfather and um she is watching actually my grandfather is doing quite well now but she um watched him so we now have him in a day care um in hilliard 

Recording: (1200/ 8002) 
yeah and 

Recording: (1201/ 8002) 
um in general i think i think the united states has a fairly well developed like class not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (1202/ 8002) 
all forty eight <LAUGH> lower that is right you have been to australia <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (1203/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (1204/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1205/ 8002) 
whenever he well i thought he was gonna be elected uh mayor too but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but um uh you know he is got his and their gonna reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes a mistake is saying labeling things racist that are not necessarily racist but anyway 

Recording: (1206/ 8002) 
would not even think about asking 

Recording: (1207/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (1208/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1209/ 8002) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt a child i mean just because you are a black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same THING with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (1210/ 8002) 
i have to get a job and support myself so 

Recording: (1211/ 8002) 
is it 

Recording: (1212/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1213/ 8002) 
grandview has it is own school system too but 

Recording: (1214/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1215/ 8002) 
so it brings that and it is uh like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools i will bet you they are all about the same 

Recording: (1216/ 8002) 
umhum um wow uh huh umhum well i have i have two uncles that are southern baptist ministers <LAUGH> and it used to be when we would visit them in the mid sixties we would have to go i mean if you visit your relative if your relatives visit and you are minister minister you have to go to church <LAUGH> and uh but the thing is is southern baptist um service always has that period where you are 

Recording: (1217/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1218/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1219/ 8002) 
and then like lets see a lot of it was i mean most of it was was like pre labor and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video it was mostly like labor related

Recording: (1264/ 8002) 
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting behind 

Recording: (1265/ 8002)

right 

Recording: (1573/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (1574/ 8002) 
yeah i just renewed my certification certificate last year so i MAY GET BACK INTO IT part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason um i had one that just had a baby <LAUGH> and um they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once and i it was the algebra two another time but they expected us to at least expected me uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history <LAUGH> so really requires you to be well rounded <LAUGH> and i i like kind of like that um i have taught in a couple of other places um community colleges the college in newark i taught a chemistry class there and the community college which is in hillsboro but i taught at their branch and i taught a introduction an introduction to ecology class there an introduction to uh introduction to the arts it was called <LAUGH> and that was interesting it was those are it is kind of an underclass of teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you um per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour <LAUGH> so 

Recording: (1575/ 8002) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is you are perspective inthat sense

Recording: (1578/ 8002) 
i think there is been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking him away from the the cousins i mean they have the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs family well there is not much closer family than your father and that that that they love this country and this stuff well then accept the laws and follow them whether you DONT agree with them or not um i i i it was very unfortunate the way it happened uh but i think the government should not let it go on as long as it had 

Recording: (1579/ 8002) 
umhum yeah me and my mom are real close 

Recording: (1580/ 8002) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an o s u employee

Recording: (1582/ 8002) 
about uh thirteen years i think my dad uh once he got through with his residency and everything we moved to mansfield and he joined a practice and we have been living there ever since um mansfield is about i would say fifty five sixty thousand people and ashland is probably about twenty five to thirty thousand people but um mansfield is sort of fascinating to <LAUGH> per capita murder rate in mansfield is higher than anywhere else in in ohio <LAUGH> YEAH um it is just it is very industrialized there is the there is a lot of um a certain community that lives there that normally would not live in a smaller city like that there is just a lot of there is a lot of crime in mansfield um there is a steel factory there is a uh not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of of um industry in the mansfield area but there is a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed it is it is been there for a while yeah we have got the mansfield state reformatory where shawshank redemption was where shawshank redemption was recorded yep yep well i do not know if that is our claim to fame but but we do we do have that in mansfield but um ashland is a little bit more and a little bit more of what mat affects a lot more locates more of a it is more of a um agricultural county um ashland city is right where i live it is you know i mean we are like five minutes outside of ashland city but ashland city is the county seat for ashland county and um mansfield is the county seat for richland county yeah but everybody does everything in mansfield because there is nothing to do in ashland but uh the mansfield branch campus for o s u is there well growing up in mansfield was um uh yeah it was really boring it was really boring um my dad was just getting himself settled into the community and and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while um most of my early childhood memories are from where where we lived in mansfield it was uh it was a real it was a real do not talk do not ask community mean you really did not know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi they never came over so yeah yeah yeah we lived in a suburban area of mansfield sort of like the uh the the white collar area where all the people who were business men were getting themselves established so and then um we switched churches and also my dad opened up he he and his partner opened up another uh branch office in ashland so we moved to the ashland area about about eight years ago almost nine years ago and we moved to ashland to get half way between um dad is my dad is not centrally located between the ashland office the hospital that is in ashland the hospitals that are in mansfield he is about he said it is about a twenty minute drive from all the places he needs to be um actually yeah we live on an we live on an now we live on an eighty acre farm yeah we have gotten a nice big house a barn some tractors no animals well we have got a dog but but um it is it is a farm in the sense that we have got a barn we have got tractors we lease we lease some of the land out to a a farmer who who actually works in plants stuff no not to be on a farm no my dad is a doctor <LAUGH> i 

Recording: (1583/ 8002) 
yeah nah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more than most kindergarteners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something thats educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we will go to different websites sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to EVERYTHING <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1584/ 8002) 
and he said even in the when he was in high school that they had they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people with like knives and you would have people with fist fights but you like guns was unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh they are people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it you know like i do not i i did not feel that way but i would like in retrospect i look back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so traumatizing to them like that would be so like for four years every day you are just like teased or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (1585/ 8002) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposely tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad 

Recording: (1586/ 8002)

i think so he is he is not being forced to go in any direction that he is not ready for yeah i was going to college and and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so he was very independent but i am not sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being put and being in daycare from a very very young age and and then you know my youngest he is never been in daycare at all so

Recording: (1611/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1612/ 8002)

Recording: (1613/ 8002) 
and it was just when the drug culture was just you know starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you have to talk to them about things and just say you know i want to help you and i you know be there for them a hundred percent obviously those parents were to busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be to blame i do 

Recording: (1614/ 8002) 
to put 

Recording: (1615/ 8002) 
hey 

Recording: (1616/ 8002)

yep half tank gas 

Recording: (1621/ 8002) 
do kwaanza do chanukah do so that they can learn other cultures and the other values but they just do not do any of them 

Recording: (1622/ 8002) 
no because i think there is the ideal in everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and uh i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now um i mean i i could never agree with abortion lets say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control issue became so personal and um it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a what i felt was a clear conscience and what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (1623/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (1624/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1625/ 8002) 
YEAH you know that is that is the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with uh with all the i mean and i am uh i am so opinionated in this too and anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through and like i see lazarus and i see kohl is and i see sears you look through and you say oh okay you know you are looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women in bras and they are looking at the camera they are seductively looking at the camera and you are like okay how many how many different bras do women really need THAT IS not for the women i am sorry you know most women by the time they are buying bras know what choices they have YKNOW THEY do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men the men is heads are usually cut off they are not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all i mean it is just so unequal so we lead these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up we push all this and you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or you know anything else happens to them 

Recording: (1626/ 8002)

Recording: (1634/ 8002) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (1635/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (1636/ 8002) 
i mean dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time and i uh i would tip i am my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i am not too say that i certainly would not vote um for the person that i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (1637/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1638/ 8002) 
umhum at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would not move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so uh such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their scores up um they will you know 

Recording: (1639/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1640/ 8002)

Recording: (1643/ 8002) 
umhum and that hurt her to go she thought she was letting you know neglecting me i was in 

Recording: (1644/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> plus i do not really feel like the republicanpartyrepresents the populace at a whole like at their LAST political convention like in uh the last presidential election in ninety six they said one in ten of the delegates that were attending the convention were millionaires now granted i know more than ten people and not you know what i mean sotomei just feel like that is not a good representation 

Recording: (1645/ 8002) 
yeah so 

Recording: (1646/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1647/ 8002) 
of the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (1648/ 8002) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (1649/ 8002) 
yeah i am a democrat and i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always adored mark hatfield I DIDNT VOTE FOR HIM WHILE I WAS OUT THERE was the weirdest thing because i thought he was a great REPUBLICAN <LAUGH> but i think uh personally mike coleman was good i i have met uh well <LAUGH> we had a diamond jubilee at the village and and coleman and teater both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i did not think that there was much that much difference in them i think you know she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but um i in terms of having a black mayor i think that is good for columbus i 

Recording: (1650/ 8002) 
al gore really does not entice me at all he claims he invented the internet <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1651/ 8002) 
<LAUGH>

umhum 

Recording: (1653/ 8002) 
i mean uh i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i always think of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because the you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the other way it hurt me you know and it is well you know 

Recording: (1654/ 8002) 
that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to gloss over effectively so when she said look if you never listen to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe i was like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (1655/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 8002)

Recording: (1680/ 8002) 
i just can not believe and they said they did not even know what was going on 

Recording: (1681/ 8002)

Recording: (1682/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (1683/ 8002) 
for a m c is for um not getting hurt <LAUGH> she works at fedex and um her crew is always getting hurt mainly her 

Recording: (1684/ 8002) 
i think so i think so um it is it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off now i do not mean it is by any stretch that it is a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (1685/ 8002) 
well no she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (1686/ 8002)

in the way of benefits 

Recording: (1692/ 8002) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do i mean you hafta be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traffic controller who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extreme good at it and then the other people uh that i know of one that i work with on a regular basis he is got a masters degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weakest ones you know and it is um

yeah it is gonna have to be from the bottom up i think and everybody keeps and i i am just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything they are coming with two thousand on it well i am hoping people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but i am hoping that it does mean since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope uh y two k i do not know what that really stands for <LAUGH> i have to think of some words there but you know i hope uh since everybody is just making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal yeah 

Recording: (1722/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1723/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1724/ 8002)

Recording: (1896/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1897/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1898/ 8002) 
while while poohpoohing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff as as far as bringing the two together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1899/ 8002) 
yeah it was like freshman or sophomore year 

Recording: (1900/ 8002) 
oh yeah well i do not know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1901/ 8002) 
you know i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never wanna you know ever say anything but um yeah that 

Recording: (1902/ 8002) 
what we are animals 

Recording: (1903/ 8002) 
yeah i would i would say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english or math or you know can not believe i am saying this history but <LAUGH> i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on you are own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that those other 

Recording: (1904/ 8002) 
then then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (1905/ 8002) 
uh it is a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot in there how hot who knows but it is been such a strengthening spiritually strengthening thing it also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat um it gets all the crap out of you 

Recording: (1906/ 8002) 
oh boy like action oh fight the bad guys yeah and now it is uh you know like looking sort of postulating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metaphor for things in real life uh and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and upon our culture i think it is kinda interesting and now that it is coming back out uh i mean i look at things from a little different perspective but i mean yeah of the maybe i think i have done about ten twelve paintings of which i am like consider to be done and and like 

Recording: (1907/ 8002) 
yeah and i do not know if it is quite that BAD BUT <LAUGH> but it was certainly some things that he is been doing that are not are not approved of and i am not real up on that so 

Recording: (1908/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1909/ 8002) 
all right 

Recording: (1910/ 8002) 
then would be with a black president and i think it would cause problems um i do not know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see here definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (1911/ 8002) 
with six normal kids because l d kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry 

Recording: (1912/ 8002) 
so hey 

Recording: (1913/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1914/ 8002) 
and uh then they powers that be you know american army decided well we will go up to this little area of uh oh i was there six months or four months anzio 

Recording: (1915/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1916/ 8002) 
san diego is probably why yeah i have heard that is a nice place 

Recording: (1917/ 8002) 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1918/ 8002) 
you know so it is uh you know if if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1919/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> yes pets are 

Recording: (1920/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is gonna come down and do that SO WELL YKNOW WHAT I MEAN we can not really decide that but to be honest i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tubes tied is is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still not still much cheaper than them having kids um and then if they i would give more money if they would clean up their act just for them um as far as it being racist i do not think i think they are missing the the point because i am sure there is some runaway white teenage girls out there too or mexican or what not um 

Recording: (1921/ 8002) 
yeah i got a son he is a senior at otterbein 

Recording: (1922/ 8002)

oh so there is so that is like that is 

Recording: (1927/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1928/ 8002) 
uh because i was not allowed to wear jeans i was not allowed to wear tennis shoes 

Recording: (1929/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1930/ 8002) 
yeah uh he he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody sign for it but um he was one of the people that had really been yes and so he fired him but not for that because you can not do that it is illegal so he but he sent a form letter with everybody it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names were changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (1931/ 8002) 
it is a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (1932/ 8002) 
well uh here yeah they gave us ten thousand here is a dollar have fun 

Recording: (1933/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1934/ 8002) 
NO THATS not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1935/ 8002) 
but she is yelling at everybody is prejudice against her and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1936/ 8002) 
she is the type of person i love to annoy 

Recording: (1937/ 8002) 
exactly 

Recording: (1938/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1939/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1940/ 8002) 
uhhuh and then when i got my masters no i did it no i did it during um the weekends and the summers and the nights and took me about mm well i started teaching in nineteen seventy seventy one 

Recording: (1941/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (1942/ 8002) 
yeah and uh i had the prerogative i coulda gone somewhere else and made more money you know but well what the bad part was is university is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raises and everything so it least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1943/ 8002) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person she would just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (1944/ 8002) 
i have seen the um big amphitheater and with that uh the what is that the opera house yeah right right on the right on there was the ocean or whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1945/ 8002) 
oh yeah umhum it is the biggest thing 

Recording: (1946/ 8002) 
yeah <LAUGH> that is it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (1947/ 8002) 
uh she was through with her pregnancy but she did end up just going to a public school 

Recording: (1948/ 8002) 
uh essentially all the big academics most the uh it is actually all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1949/ 8002) 
you be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks 

Recording: (1950/ 8002) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (1951/ 8002) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look it like well none of my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it you know <LAUGH> they look at it like it is a big pain because they gotta run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting they are time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty percent of population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to so they go back to the six hour dosage you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they are late to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they are in denial just like we would be they say it does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what are the things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1952/ 8002) 
umhum yeah mm i think it could have i thought she would get a better education out there uh now at saint louis school public school district she probably district she probably would have had the same as here but by being kirkwood you know and relatively small and everything um i think we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class you know so uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know uh then i would have at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1953/ 8002) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does not i mean i was surprised like i would i have never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one ACTUALLY 

Recording: (1954/ 8002) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1955/ 8002) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (1956/ 8002) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i would do is register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i could not vote till i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that you know worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if i would known that they were not gonna vote at eighteen and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty i would not of i would not of wasted my time um but anyway um you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age 

Recording: (1957/ 8002) 
i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and can not you have to shave and um you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can unless it is really hot there is it is different also depending on the climate 

Recording: (1958/ 8002) 
wow so is you pretty much have to be you know can not be middle class in new york have to be have to be rich or you are not 

Recording: (1959/ 8002) 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (1960/ 8002) 
without going into too much detail um one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine and theological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he does not and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heretic and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were iming each other and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right dude i i honestly do not know uh people get really scared there is certain i mean like there is certain denominations that will take one it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to crystal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it any more denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apostolic christian church we are talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the sermon is read in three different languages some really wacky stuff 

Recording: (1961/ 8002)

Recording: (1970/ 8002) 
you know what KIND OF AN ANSWER is that even if your answer is i do not know why you can not do it it just makes me uncomfortable you know that is a lot more fair than because i am the boss of you or something like that and i think if you respect your kids and and just kinda set boundaries with them you know kinda try to be i do not know that is the way that is the way my family is always been and it always seems to work really well for us 

Recording: (1971/ 8002)

Recording: (1979/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (1980/ 8002)

Recording: (1981/ 8002) 
and i think there is an article this last wednesday in the dispatch in business section as to how the p u c o can not regulate it and because of it they want to deregulate telecommunications uh and so for the past months we have not been getting telephone bills for usage we have the backbone we are paying for and what is going to happen out of this whole thing is it offers us a a a a lot of latitude where with uh we can now um if we have a contractor lets say over in dayton and we are calling from zanesville office i would rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going over dayton we can make that call as if it is a local call avoiding all long distance 

Recording: (1982/ 8002) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1983/ 8002) 
right so they do not come see me and i guess i should not care because i i would just like them actually what i would like them is come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have that is all i care about i just wanna show it off 

Recording: (1984/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (1985/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with them 

Recording: (1986/ 8002) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference um i can say from what i have seen the people that went to the catholic schools um they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are <LAUGH> really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 

Recording: (1987/ 8002) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (1988/ 8002) 
i do not i mean and it was my money SO why should it matter 

Recording: (1989/ 8002)

Recording: (1990/ 8002) 
henderson olentangy 

Recording: (1991/ 8002) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just every one there is a a bad dark side in the story so children just are and i mean it is in their and then including my own daughter she and i would swear i had her watch mister ROGERS ALL THE TIME <LAUGH> but now that she is older she watches tv she is addicted to <cutoff=d=tv> tv something terrible and then so of course her children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have HAVE tv when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really goes you know and but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is face anymore as matter of fact i am getting so i do not watch the news 

Recording: (1992/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (1993/ 8002) 
absolutely 

Recording: (1994/ 8002) 
i went THERE one day to eat my lunch all the time for two weeks and they paid me ten dollars a day 

Recording: (1995/ 8002) 
and what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you know so 

Recording: (1996/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (1997/ 8002) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (1998/ 8002) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1999/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2000/ 8002) 
one thing okay go head well i one thing um i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe lots lots of people do not is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (2001/ 8002) 
so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am to i am up to like ninety four right now and i figured that would be a decent i mean it translates over because we are on semesters it will get all messed up there but it is it is like i am half way to three fourths done with uh with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now would be like because i after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits will not transfer over it would be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just figure right now i should look 

Recording: (2002/ 8002) 
yeah and yeah so i 

Recording: (2003/ 8002) 
well i met a lot more different cultures seen how a lot more different people live and found out how lucky i was 

Recording: (2004/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2005/ 8002) 
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah

Recording: (2012/ 8002) 
for two bucks you know you can not beat that 

Recording: (2013/ 8002) 
right well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um yeah you know i really struggle with that because <vocnoise=i> i come more from i think the family should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are gonna do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um <LAUGH> sound like my dad BUT IT SEEMS like these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids should not be 

Recording: (2014/ 8002)

which i feel has been completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh i have inherited this world where there was of uh uh where am i going with this <LAUGH> um i mean the generation before us had like vietnam and protested against it i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear so i am not exactly sure where i am going with this i very cynical of uh about about the world i have inherited uh cause i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by fifty years of of you know like international politics sort of like propaganda um that says you know like to be left of a certain point is bad like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like <LAUGH> almost like calling someone a communist in in the forties um where as i am very cynical about that cause it they feel that it it was not it it it is been a cultural process that has been developed and now i am being handed this current situation which i see is completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical and the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the the the hypocrisy i mean i guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but that is why i am cynical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kinda preachy <LAUGH> like this is my position 

Recording: (2049/ 8002) 
um i do not think that really matters honestly um I MEAN ITS i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you are usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by THAT time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they LIKE and do not like um i can not see i can not see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone that they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am gonna have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (2050/ 8002) 
yeah you just sit at the computer and key the data in or well the system we are doing now is you can put in like um the address the u r l for a web resource it goes out and extracts data analyzes what is there and comes up with ya know subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it so ya know it is it is doing some of that some of that the automatic assigning and subject headings and call numbers that is that is a lot of re we are doing a lot of research on that it is got a ways to go it is getting better 

Recording: (2051/ 8002) 
yeah i would always maintained that uh back in the day uh the darth vader was the tragic hero of the star wars thing it was not you know about like the innocence of luke skywalker and rebellion and 

Recording: (2052/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (2053/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (2054/ 8002) 
yeah so 

Recording: (2055/ 8002) 
so how do you know how do you know 

Recording: (2056/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (2057/ 8002) 
and most your people that own guns that are killing people are usually your poorer people 

Recording: (2058/ 8002) 
um but recently they are getting into going to church um 

Recording: (2059/ 8002) 
umhum umhum umhum 

Recording: (2060/ 8002) 
um i do not know if you could say that there were a lot of problems i mean i even had problems like on the school bus and stuff you know but i had black friends so uh i did not have much you know much problems 

Recording: (2061/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2062/ 8002) 
was it what 

Recording: (2063/ 8002) 
they are they are they are wonderful everybody always says to me rachel i just do not know what you are doing will you come and take care of mine for me and it is it is the fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions and i treat them everybody says your mom is weird she talks to us strange it is because i talk to them like i talk to you at at whatever age they are you know i do not yeah i do not talk down to kids i 

Recording: (2064/ 8002) 
like not really i mean i played we played with friends we never played anywhere just fooling around like in people is basements and stuff like never really organized enough to try and play anywhere really guitar bass yeah like like real like you know like jam oriented stuff you know like the dead stuff like that like i do not know like like like dead kind of like reggae type stuff too just like a bunch of different things 

Recording: (2065/ 8002) 
but 

Recording: (2066/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2067/ 8002) 
yeah yeah exactly last three outs everyone is like yeah let us hope he does it but until then you are like okay this is ridiculous 

Recording: (2068/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2069/ 8002) 
and there were several couples who got married 

Recording: (2070/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2071/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2072/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (2073/ 8002) 
probably would not have even stopped he is sitting there going what are you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested man he took my necklace tried take them all radio too and uh you know i kind of threw that in there make it sound bad BUT <LAUGH> i was on my way to work man i did not want it anything bad to happen to me or him you know so all in all the cop you know put guy in handcuffs put him back car he goes well do you want to press charges and at that time i was little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let him out of the car i will beat his ass <LAUGH> oh man the cop said something that i never forget he said i would but that would probably hafta be my job to do if we was living like that <LAUGH> i was like god man rodney king all over again <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2074/ 8002) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to them because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh you know like there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you turn left instead of right and you may come back and go uh do you do you mean left or right there and i go yes that is correct turn left you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kindness goes a long way and the pilots the same way most often they are you know pretty decent 

Recording: (2075/ 8002) 
i mean i think they could try if their their kids try and push them away they should not you know let their kids push them away you know i guess you can not make your kid go out with you and do things 

Recording: (2076/ 8002) 
yeah yeah that is pretty much what we was made to do you know back in the pioneer days you did not have this crap with the kid going fix me some canned ravioli or <LAUGH> and you gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his OWN MEALS <LAUGH> that is an interesting thing i just saw on the in the news week i was reading that and

Recording: (2078/ 8002) 
ITS LIKE WE do not have one at home because we are worried of THAT 

Recording: (2079/ 8002) 
we should look at it as as a sport 

Recording: (2080/ 8002) 
uh yeah yeah because if she was they are charging her two bucks down there and i told her i says you need to really not get twenty dollars out at a time because i said you need to get like sixty or eighty because i says you get eighty bucks out you are gonna pay eight dollars for it twenty bucks at a time but if you get eighty bucks out you are gonna get two bucks and she goes but if i have eighty dollars i will spend it and i says well you have a footlocker with a lock on it put seventy dollars in there and have ten on you and she is like oh and i said the i know that is because that is what dad is gotta do <LAUGH> i said i can not carry money or i will spend it you know

Recording: (2090/ 8002) 
see i do not want that to happen to me because i just that is um i mean i had a guy that i did start dating when my son was a baby but um it just he got he fell in love with me 

Recording: (2091/ 8002)

Recording: (2103/ 8002) 
yeah um and i can say there are some drugs that i do not really consider to be too threatening or that i am really too worried about people using um like i mean just the whole idea with marijuana things like that i mean it does not really bother me so much i mean cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does 

Recording: (2104/ 8002) 
staggered backbeats and stuff and like i can play bass and like i i have like like a processor thing and stuff that i fool around with just doing stuff like that and some of my friends like play on drum machines and stuff like that so i just do stuff like that more like it is not it is not like you are playing like you are not spinning records just like making

Recording: (2114/ 8002) 
exactly 

Recording: (2115/ 8002) 
they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (2116/ 8002)

Recording: (2491/ 8002) 
yeah well what um what my opinion on our whole penal system is just you know well it goes along with not kind of neglecting the kids in our schools now and we are definitely neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they have uh learned incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh they need to have psychological help period 

Recording: (2492/ 8002)

oh that is it 

Recording: (2501/ 8002) 
but it did not bother me uh religion is basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties the i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or something like that but uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspoken <error=isla=islam> muslims and uh islam and uh and judaism and everything so and there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you you got to meet yourself you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know if you believe in religion you are you are here temporarily for an eternity later on you know 

Recording: (2502/ 8002) 
but she was never interested in and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or uh make up and clothes and things like that and you know you are setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and that is what happened she would come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she got her g e d 

Recording: (2503/ 8002) 
and they see the same thing it is mirrored back to them because we are made in christ is images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do positive today and build on the positive it may be the smallest part of that sheet of paper

i was going then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then on the very very opposite extreme uh extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i am not quite sure how to address that because in a in in some some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of out both sides your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (2507/ 8002) 
yeah they are they are really good about that 

Recording: (2508/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (2509/ 8002) 
you know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just wanted to start off with something easy and um they only take national merit scholars in there 

Recording: (2510/ 8002) 
in the world 

Recording: (2511/ 8002)

okay 

Recording: (2648/ 8002) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i do not i do not even know because to start it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is gonna be everybody all together that has to work it is gonna be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about elian this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this little kid who still has a living parent and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line and

anyway and um i am not saying in general but with the experiences that i have had um certain families where they do not uh socioeconomically just not as well off 

Recording: (2729/ 8002) 
if they are especially if they are over forty because their company is giving money back to the community for this and that and you know that is how they are trying to show that they care about this they are trying to mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the downtrodden or you know but you are right i think it is terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do better science skills than we do better language than we do why canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve you know and i just think that this proficiency thing is finally going to make people accountable

uhhuh 

Recording: (2841/ 8002) 
i mean there is always been the nerds and um i do not know when i was growing up in the seventies there really was not punk or anything like that and i think um unfortunately i mean there is always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they just pushed you to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want a i saw you know i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by a um a jock 

Recording: (2842/ 8002) 
you know in this sport especially i think golf 

Recording: (2843/ 8002) 
when i started dating at almost seventeen um so no i think i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are um i i personally do not think a school can do it 

Recording: (2844/ 8002) 
WORD YEAH 

Recording: (2845/ 8002) 
no but i have i have two daughters and two sons m and i heard my daughters talking about they want to do something special for my sixty fifth birthday so they would given me a party on my sixtieth so i do not know what it is going to be but i think they will do they they talked about something in the way of a trip so maybe something the three of us can do together so i am just 

Recording: (2846/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2847/ 8002) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dynasty i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourist like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked the whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pitt and juliette lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else and you know their accent and and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like oh you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it is like in the south and i thought OH MY GOSH you know what an image to have of like the south and you know i was just kind of shocked at this but i think that there you know with you know people who are going to university there and things like that there is not necessarily that opinion maybe you know in a certain sector like when all you have heard is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think you know most people like me or whatever they well i should not say like but you know people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about it but you know there is not just that blatant view i mean i think that it is um the consumption thing like i think a lot more realize now that you know i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like obviously when you give that a closer look so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said you know across the board we do not even break even we are like negative one or something

yeah or yeah or you know it is tough when you know you have got kids that are doing softball soccer you know all these events and you know like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually drives from work to the softball and after that she home by nine so she is like i can see how you fall into this drive through window business you know no but luckily you know i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can find feed them and i can get them so that is how our life is mister mom 

Recording: (2883/ 8002) 
there is a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (2884/ 8002) 
it is story elements 

Recording: (2885/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2886/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2887/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2888/ 8002) 
opening of that tunnel and THEY fired a couple of our shells into the tunnel and then took off 

Recording: (2889/ 8002) 
and they had the strong uh public uh support over there it is a really is tight knit community it is uh quite different columbus needs to learn a lot from that area and uh it is a matter of just uh putting in i guess your hands in the your practicing your faith which we 

Recording: (2890/ 8002) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (2891/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2892/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2893/ 8002) 
well is it 

Recording: (2894/ 8002) 
yeah so you know his friend lives on the other side you know it is like a duplex and his friend lived on the other side and he uh he also was uh broken into they came through his bathroom window 

Recording: (2895/ 8002) 
very big <LAUGH> i probably down the line because like we are still struggling to get up you know <LAUGH> we are waiting for that million dollar CHEC THERE THAT 

Recording: (2896/ 8002) 
so i almost bought one um uh couple weeks ago in fact i went <LAUGH> i went into contract on it with this guy this dear old man whose it was for his mother who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest which is north and i made this this low offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was gonna get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because of the baby coming and we are gonna be busy and i did not wanna get involved in and so i made this offer and then he countered back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he countered back at ninety six and i said that and you know i thought well good now i do not worry about he is never gonna come to it so i wrote back and said you know i appreciate your offer but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i i could do and i did not even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2897/ 8002) 
uh will not lie there uh lot of happy strippers in town so or i should say exotic dancers 

Recording: (2898/ 8002) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more but i mean obviously they are gonna have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over powerful as far is the the number of guys being out there are violent i mean it is something that unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2899/ 8002) 
so now he is back into lawn care until something else better comes along 

Recording: (2900/ 8002) 
yeah i contributed to too many people there is too many people there is not enough committment it is too easy to get divorced and it uh the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of um just people everywhere and young people today i do not i you know i do not know what the statistics are gonna be but they i do not think they have a good idea of what marriage even is you know before and also before a marriage was a committment to a a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent then might it might work but um i you know and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (2901/ 8002) 
oh that is great <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2902/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (2903/ 8002) 
do do do 

Recording: (2904/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2905/ 8002) 
so i you know they probably all hey you resemble that remark or YNKNOW 

Recording: (2906/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2907/ 8002) 
YEAH but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother is name was harriet 

Recording: (2908/ 8002) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosie cozy i have a 

Recording: (2909/ 8002) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (2910/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2911/ 8002) 
every day the other one i do not see that much anymore 

Recording: (2912/ 8002) 
yeah medicaid i think i think it 

Recording: (2913/ 8002) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (2914/ 8002) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really wanna see chicago is not that far washington is not that far um new york is and i do not get to new york that often but um you know i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i wanna go to the trouble 

Recording: (2915/ 8002) 
uhhuh his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (2916/ 8002) 
well i think all through growing up there is always been you know different kind of kids 

Recording: (2917/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2918/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2919/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> do you have a three oclock 

Recording: (2920/ 8002) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general or family 

Recording: (2921/ 8002) 
yep i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but um it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not realize you know their old guns that they confiscate and they do not realize where they are going i mean that amazes me um but there is always gonna be the underworld and different ways that kids and people can get guns and it is sad i do not know how we could ever limit that but there is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but you know you it is like identification thing you know 

Recording: (2922/ 8002) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the um sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (2923/ 8002) 
oh that was a football game deal 

Recording: (2924/ 8002) 
the that is why it is mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2925/ 8002) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2926/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2927/ 8002) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough violists or something you know an instrument like that um but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for the last few rehearsals umhum so we sort of have stringers i guess you would CALL THEM <LAUGH> yeah we have actually been on w o s u also uh radio on music um our recording last year yeah of beethoven is ninth got on music in midohio <LAUGH> yeah we used the otterbein college choir um 

Recording: (2928/ 8002) 
hm 

Recording: (2929/ 8002) 
and come back in 

Recording: (2930/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2931/ 8002) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (2932/ 8002) 
um college wise i do not know anyone of college age that is gay 

Recording: (2933/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> time to go ALL RIGHT IM DONE HERE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2934/ 8002) 
oh i would be surprised 

Recording: (2935/ 8002) 
oh i hafta eat it that is like <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2936/ 8002) 
i KNOW 

Recording: (2937/ 8002) 
right she just went there last year 

Recording: (2938/ 8002) 
uh uh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (2939/ 8002) 
um and you kinda knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that is still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um so i do not i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger more comfortable movie theaters and and that kinda stuff it has not really 

Recording: (2940/ 8002) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrust back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (2941/ 8002) 
because conceivably they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (2942/ 8002) 
right right well let me ask you ah about somebody else who is not that well known do you know john gorka have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is he is funny he has good songs he is a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arlo guthry or somebody i mean he he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does acoustic and um he writes most of his own songs yeah and if you ever see something by him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection ask to listen to it he has funny funny some of the songs are really funny and some of them are the saddest things you have ever heard yeah YEAH <LAUGH> just just tragic things <LAUGH> um uh let us see funny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows <LAUGH> um let us see oh i can not think of too much of them right now but uh yeah 

Recording: (2943/ 8002) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should not sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then you know you should not do it 

Recording: (2944/ 8002) 
usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2945/ 8002) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her and husband was having problems and my niece is uh eight well she was in fifth grade in there is a elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarettes and everything and i just am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (2946/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2947/ 8002) 
sophomore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master is 

Recording: (2948/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (2949/ 8002) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the PARENTS love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well um so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting um they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (2950/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (2951/ 8002) 
but it is mindboggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams you know it is just mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with you know know of hand full of people and do not know anybody else it is like you know a lot more of a tight knit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (2952/ 8002) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least it lets us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that as you increase your knowledge you are far better OFF <LAUGH> THAN to stay in this little hole over here and this is all i wanna know about 

Recording: (2953/ 8002) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to 

Recording: (2954/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2955/ 8002) 
but he just did not have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (2956/ 8002) 
that 

Recording: (2957/ 8002) 
everybody is 

Recording: (2958/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (2959/ 8002) 
as much probably 

Recording: (2960/ 8002) 
how many times you have been in ireland 

Recording: (2961/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (2962/ 8002) 
i do believe i do believe and i think maybe i will ask you because you are one of the younger generation have not you as you have grown older have not you looked back sometime and said boy mom was right about that dad was right about that i think the older a child gets and that includes us too now that we are our age because we are i am almost as old as my mother was when she died i am older than my father was when he died i do believe i see now where just living life it would keep your eyes and ears open and your mind you gotta have your mind open to receive what your eyes and EARS SAY I GUESS um you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school but there is a lot of things you are just not gonna learn except by actual experience and living life and i believe that that is a lot of it right there because i know i started to say a while ago and i do not think i finished it i myself have these wants getting only what i need versus all these little wants and desires because i grew up in the depression and did not have these things consequently i have got a doll collection a teddy bear collection an angel collection record collection you would not believe a whole one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room the books i would started when the kids were little because they did read at home and that libraries were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and consequently i have kept the books and it is amazing but some of those grandchildren almost all of them that come over the house said they get bored they will go over to the book they will go over that bookcase and they will start looking for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent now however my one son is gone too far he is got one room is completely lined with books and a hallway part of is books and i do not know whether the kids ever go and pick those up or not because they are always going to the library so you see it is what is taught at home that really count but we do not need all those material things and now i am sitting back and thinking well which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are gonna keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money and TRAVEL <LAUGH> you see what i mean you change your opinions change as you get older and you begin to look back i do not think i was ever a spendthrift to the point that i did things foolishly some things i did do foolish but i mean on a over all basis 

Recording: (2963/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2964/ 8002) 
aw 

Recording: (2965/ 8002) 
yeah the local ones more than anything uh 

Recording: (2966/ 8002)

Recording: (2979/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (2980/ 8002) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because thats the way it was worded <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2981/ 8002) 
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now and then umhum i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to the catholic church for example they can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attractive and they do every every religion makes it more attractive for her oh as used to come from oh yeah but the bottom line is you are trying to still if you are a christian focus back to the bible 

Recording: (2982/ 8002) 
to some extent yeah but to some extent no because see when i was in the service it was a different time 

Recording: (2983/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2984/ 8002) 
so he would not have to pay for it 

Recording: (2985/ 8002) 
example that i asked my manager the other day she told me i was supposed to do this certain thing and i asked her i said well they told me i was not supposed to 

Recording: (2986/ 8002) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2987/ 8002)

Recording: (2990/ 8002) 
just general manners 

Recording: (2991/ 8002) 
just because uh um women have a medicine you know and probably because that was lacking in my life um i could not focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman is voice in there but then some of the elders sat me down and and the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts women go in there in a long cotton dress you will hear people say you go in there naked 

Recording: (2992/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (2993/ 8002)

Recording: (2994/ 8002) 
YES 

Recording: (2995/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (2996/ 8002) 
oh yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (2997/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (2998/ 8002) 
ah yeah fine now it comes back to your statement what do they tell us we need well now well gee you need a refrigerator you need frost free you need all these things and you know what you go down the street and see how many garage sales you have and then you ask people why would you buy them oh we thought we needed them 

Recording: (2999/ 8002) 
oh the white ones okay 

Recording: (3000/ 8002) 
yeah and and never got any better then they got in marching band and they were in that for four years and sometimes we notice they marched and sometimes they did not because they did not learn their music but they stayed with it and they said then they like volunteered down at cosi they did not get paid a dime for this but they did it because they enjoyed helping and definite so like they go we want that student over there said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us and you over there as a b student have proved that by gosh you know you will try out for something and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am gonna keep with it you know and to me the straight a student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their life at all and the other one has you know activities and they are giving of themselves to the community you know you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter egg hunts for the school is a grade school and it is attached to columbus alternative high school so um you know i i read an um uh a uh resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the the closest she got to crying at school was when she would uh do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy and it was just they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or twos worth of candy and hid it out and they would have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says you know those and things that were important to her and you know to me that makes you feel like you are worth something but the kids that go you know the ones who went to school i you know i do not see any community service or i do not know about i i am not a big gung ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i am a christian but i am not a church goer and i do not think you hafta go there to be a religious person you know but uh you know i think religion and community service and feeling like you have given something to the community and you know you are just not asking continuously for it you know and and trying things and failing at them and going okay well but i still like to play basketball i am terrible but i like to play and i can not make the team so what do i do i know i will go to the y and play there you know that that is what keeps kids out of trouble and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and you know what do the chat room stuff or the e mail stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those the ones that are the big problem children because they you know mom and dad go how can i get them to do something and stay out of my hair oh i know i will buy them a nintendo i will buy them this sega i will buy this look they are out of my way you know because you know 

Recording: (3001/ 8002) 
i forget they have the like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so that to me is not that is not admirable and then i so the that is one reason i would not vote for bush 

Recording: (3002/ 8002) 
definitely i am such a slacker here it is GREAT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3003/ 8002) 
very much so 

Recording: (3004/ 8002)

Recording: (3005/ 8002) 
i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers and i said yes you can make with computers and i said what could i <oney=money> with computers 

Recording: (3006/ 8002) 
i just do it for the stretching it is almost like when i am laying there and and kathy is saying you know take even though i sound speedy 

Recording: (3007/ 8002) 
right so a lot of them already believe and that they have their own religion and they they are really faithful so that was the one of the main problems is that they um they had been so holding on to that for so long and it is so strong they do not wanna let go of what and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (3008/ 8002) 
no they are not it is printed at the top every on every issue that they are financially independent 

Recording: (3009/ 8002) 
that is it i think i remember like if they were like remodeling a few years back is that right 

Recording: (3010/ 8002) 
second and third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering that is one of the reasons they were not going to move me 

Recording: (3011/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3012/ 8002) 
so was one of those 

Recording: (3013/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (3014/ 8002) 
in a fashion that makes it almost diametrically opposed to mine a great many times but at the same time the the pre religion understanding of something 

Recording: (3015/ 8002) 
no no no it is not you can do whatever you want there uh i have heard conferences where the um i have heard the prophet talk about how you should keep in touch with the people that you served and or the people that you worked with and that you knew and and that they even if they can not you can not remember how to speak just try and <LAUGH> send them a i have been really BA=BAD about that so i feel a lot of pressure to i need to i mean it is i just do not wanna lose contact with them because you get these great friendships and but yeah you can there is i know people that have married people from their i mean that is really not supposed to happen while you are on your mission but when you you know when you are done if you wanna go back um is that happens too but it is really not looked i mean you should not that is against the rules on the mission um if the people wanna get married when they get home that is fine but um yeah that is it is it is another thing where you are focused trying focus on your work and you are not allowed to date never alone <LAUGH> so and um but you can live where you have served you can do whatever you want after you are done 

Recording: (3016/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3017/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3018/ 8002)

people want a number they do not wanna know the methodology that goes into it or the the disclaimers or footnotes they do not wanna read the footnotes they want a number uh when i worked for the state one program we worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas of ohio uh which actually used originally started here the university in ohio it was a federal program department labor it was administered state level and uh it did not did not turn out very well so they switched it over to me uh for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university is fault um they had to rely on confidential information which we could not give them because it was confidential uh by federal law it was confidential we could not give it to them but they needed it so it it was just not a good one good way to do business uh and we would present information ok there for there is this this number of people in an occupation but there was also a range of error on there where people would not notice that and they would take that number as gospel and you just could not convince them that well it really means more than that uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we did not really at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of a conduit for there is several different departments in the the state and the federal government collect occupational data and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that um people would they wanted an hourly rate they did not want a range they did not want they uh they wanted a number and that is what that was gospel but it is based on survey data so and and you know there is always statistical error in there and stuff and try to explain that to we spent more time uh when people call up and give information explaining this is what this really means then the just giving them the number that we spent more time doing that uh 

Recording: (3032/ 8002) 
right you gotta pick your battles right 

Recording: (3033/ 8002) 
so like it is like you had these warring like two different camps the you know the camp that gets enthusiastic and and that is where i was and then there is the other camp and i am sure they have their own hierarchy their whole structure and like you know they do things their way 

Recording: (3034/ 8002) 
right i mean pal is booming it uh and i think personally i could not have put him in daycare when he was an infant and i think i would have quit if a family would not have been available but since family was available and i think he is very social i think he was ready for the interaction with the other kids and three days a week is not right 

Recording: (3035/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3036/ 8002) 
well that i am making an analogy with you women who is more important who saying that not being not being a priest is not important being your individual we are all called to be important a priest is just as a occupation a part of that society out there he do president of the united states is not any better off than you are he should not be

Recording: (3040/ 8002) 
but i think it should be an option you know i am really you know for women is right and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a child it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it is ultimate ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every option available especially when you are young no girl should have to go through you know pregnancy and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know it ruins their lives when they do not have the option 

Recording: (3041/ 8002) 
<LAUGH>

Recording: (3054/ 8002) 
and it is just like been so for him too uh this has been you know uh uh a real amazing road because by the time he was twenty eight he had four kids and you know and and yet you know we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he is looking forward to he is thrilled about the the baby that my daughter is gonna have but um i would have had a whole lot more kids you know i would have just kept having them and he said oh four is plenty you know he needed a break

Recording: (3059/ 8002) 
umhum uh yeah you slept you know it would well you can see it here i mean you can uh see some nineteen year old or eighteen year old uh guy or girl or whatever you know and see the difference in the maturity you know of uh another couple three different people and everything uh i do not know whether me coming from like a rural area you know athens and everything uh and i think it maybe has something to do with that even true today you know you are more uh family oriented um um your you are friends are basically you know you count them on your hands which you still can but uh but you socialize a lot more if you are in the city with more people and everything where if you come from like a smaller town you tend to socialize with a certain people you know group or or whatever you know 

Recording: (3060/ 8002) 
you have heard of the anzio beachhead we will go up there and get around behind them

Recording: (3065/ 8002) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably gonna stay with that because it is real easy life 

Recording: (3066/ 8002) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (3067/ 8002) 
now i got him 

Recording: (3068/ 8002) 
think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself racist at all it is UNFORTUNATE that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things that you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (3069/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3070/ 8002) 
cooper just i just do not see him ever hugging the guys or saying great job or anything you know 

Recording: (3071/ 8002)

Recording: (3072/ 8002)

Recording: (3079/ 8002) 
yeah four girls 

Recording: (3080/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3081/ 8002) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only thing that is gonna happen is it is gonna trickle down and you are gonna have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like it is your you know people say it is a my fault because this happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not that is a totally different perspective just to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (3082/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3083/ 8002) 
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else i really do not understand that some people do it

Recording: (3118/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3119/ 8002)

Recording: (3128/ 8002) 
nothing serious no 

Recording: (3129/ 8002) 
i think example is probably the best um they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionate soul uh very spiritual young man um more so than his brother is and i always have ah have to weigh that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better to give and i sometimes try to weigh that if that is part of why i i i i can not believe it it is an attention getter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do but um but maybe just within maybe one feels um and i think i think it it is a matter of being conscientious too you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (3130/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3131/ 8002)

Recording: (3138/ 8002)

Recording: (3193/ 8002) 
ninja TURTLES well the kids went into that just so and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks and hoods and 

Recording: (3194/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (3195/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> and then yeah i got the opportunity um a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back 

Recording: (3196/ 8002) 
i said this will never work i am not interested take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with us just work with us we will we will take care of this so i ended up selling to him for hundred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought he i thought they are never gonna get to where i have to be and we are not even gonna play this game back and forth 

Recording: (3197/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (3198/ 8002)

um i mean obviously it is something that happens everyday and things likethat um <LAUGH> like said by no means am i saying yay go president clinton or anything likethat but um i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it isnothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (3202/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3203/ 8002) 
they tried sampling well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (3204/ 8002) 
YEAH 

Recording: (3205/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3206/ 8002) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give background on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on than they are telling you um so i really do not see a big problem with the way the america is going or whatever the youth um and like say i would not say it is any WORSE than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (3207/ 8002) 
and uh my oldest sister started to school out there 

Recording: (3208/ 8002) 
umhum

YEAH 

Recording: (3218/ 8002) 
yeah it is usually like about a third or something um i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus it is just basically getting out of the house 

Recording: (3219/ 8002) 
umhum umhum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals in the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there whatever and the kids um they are basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get it everything instilled at home that is pretty much what you know i have seen talking to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (3220/ 8002) 
to do that 

Recording: (3221/ 8002) 
took my key and 

Recording: (3222/ 8002) 
the personal thing is you need to have ethics

Recording: (3225/ 8002) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these like student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty huh <LAUGH>

Recording: (3251/ 8002) 
you do not yeah yeah 

Recording: (3252/ 8002) 
i like it better than a magazine

um hum 

Recording: (3254/ 8002) 
no we we the uh the only germans i ever saw were p o w is 

Recording: (3255/ 8002)

Recording: (3258/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3259/ 8002) 
well i was married but i did not have any kids once have kids not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off any time and then when i got my masters i ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need a resource room teacher why do not you come up and interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked OUT 

Recording: (3260/ 8002) 
and i think <cutoff yeah eighty four 

Recording: (3261/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3262/ 8002) 
no i do not see that kind of racism at all 

Recording: (3263/ 8002) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the <cutoff=m=most> normal teen and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen you know ok <LAUGH> eleven twelve it is like ew he we even look alike <LAUGH> forget it but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (3264/ 8002) 
it is it is interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had made arrange she was at uh otterbein then she made arrangements that uh she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers so that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in or you know it is just too much stress for me to even think about <LAUGH> <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3265/ 8002) 
umhum he was he did some assistant coach work at uh o s u for o s u he really liked that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3266/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3267/ 8002) 
that is the appalachia area yeah umhum it would be great if somebody you know they gonna want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government pumps money into an area you know that tends to be like a uh foreign country gets it you know and 

Recording: (3268/ 8002) 
huh 

Recording: (3269/ 8002) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (3270/ 8002) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (3271/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3272/ 8002) 
umhum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher i am supposed to get an a what is wrong with you <LAUGH> what is wrong with you 

Recording: (3273/ 8002) 
mmhmm no i feel funny that i am i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years since i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (3274/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3275/ 8002) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (3276/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3277/ 8002) 
um there were one or two 

Recording: (3278/ 8002) 
but that is what i 

Recording: (3279/ 8002) 
YKNOW <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3280/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3281/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3282/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3283/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3284/ 8002) 
yes umhum 

Recording: (3285/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3286/ 8002) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (3287/ 8002) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (3288/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> yeah you should be we are all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (3289/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3290/ 8002) 
i had i had fun i enjoyed it is one my my favorite classes actually for for an elective 

Recording: (3291/ 8002) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple times and i do not know he just impresses me more than al gore 

Recording: (3292/ 8002) 
i think more what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you are still serving jail time and you get <LAUGH> you get pretty badly punished for it i mean some cases they will even chain you up and beat you in public for it um i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it um i think just the fact that the jails are so over crowded now that they know that they are gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are you are not even gonna get thirty days in jail and you are gonna be let go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (3293/ 8002) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom oh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and yeah it left marks but it and sure it hurt i mean it would sting and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up and i have ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids and none of us were injured none of us were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it was not something that truly injured uh now today however uh i suspect my mom could easily be could have been charged with abuse in fact child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that uh green it is always a green switch because uh uh the eh old ones they would break you did not want them break BREAK <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3294/ 8002) 
yeah RIGHT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3295/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3296/ 8002) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (3297/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3298/ 8002) 
well i am saying but the 

Recording: (3299/ 8002) 
hum um 

Recording: (3300/ 8002) 
eh 

Recording: (3301/ 8002) 
i uh i have gone to one but i had a back problem that is how dealt with it and it worked 

Recording: (3302/ 8002) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (3303/ 8002) 
<LAUGH>

right 

Recording: (3308/ 8002) 
there is apartments above them 

Recording: (3309/ 8002) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is worse things i would think than than dying you know you like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see uh because uh um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (3310/ 8002) 
it is salt water fish 

Recording: (3311/ 8002) 
it is whatever you gonna get away with 

Recording: (3312/ 8002)

Recording: (3313/ 8002) 
not at all 

Recording: (3314/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3315/ 8002) 
right right <LAUGH> right 

Recording: (3316/ 8002) 
oh is it really have you been there 

Recording: (3317/ 8002)

Recording: (3318/ 8002) 
you know mean i liked earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was the nicest man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that when they fired him the day before the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (3319/ 8002) 
they need a lot of women in that field you know they needs good people there um the money did not hurt <LAUGH> just 

Recording: (3320/ 8002) 
yeah procreation part of what marriage is all about but i see marriage as more than just propagating 

Recording: (3321/ 8002) 
um i mean at that point i uh i certainly did not have any uh real knowledge ABOUT ANY of that sort of thing um you know they covered the basics um they did talk about condoms and um contraception i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed by um i mean i do not really uh they uh they did send home a packet to the parents because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom TO TALK WITH ME ABOUT IT 

Recording: (3322/ 8002) 
uh and uh decisions are happening to her without her making them and um i think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her hands on 

Recording: (3323/ 8002) 
uh she ran a forklift INTO a INTO A POLE <LAUGH> and BROK busted her nose and chipped her tooth <LAUGH> she is just a dangerous woman <LAUGH> and um so uh she gets a lot of tickets sometimes when SHES NOT getting hurt YEAH when she is not running into poles AND stuff um and you know we will use them because they do not they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home we do that a lot too but 

Recording: (3324/ 8002) 
yes muchos money 

Recording: (3325/ 8002)

Recording: (3326/ 8002) 
it is another thing that they are in their own in the house where the parents are every night and not going in to the garage and finding things 

Recording: (3327/ 8002) 
i always hate it when people name their kids jamilia kenisha and i am like 

Recording: (3328/ 8002) 
i live at um one sixty one and cleveland area in an apartment up there 

Recording: (3329/ 8002) 
um i have a decoder card it what it does is it make it decodes the d v d right away rather than sending it through the processor so it is it is a lot faster it does not depend on my processor time like it the movie does not skip or anything it it just goes straight through um let us see no no nothing like that uh twice a month we have our technical modules which are we hook up the tiny little you know green screen computers and the little old keyboards from like nineteen eighty five you know sit there and tinker on those 

Recording: (3330/ 8002) 
these people drive by look at my little house there in the middle of it all

Recording: (3333/ 8002) 
one of those 

Recording: (3334/ 8002) 
and we went back to our room and we watched a movie and my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer 

Recording: (3335/ 8002) 
and you did not have the violence and stuff like that i have never heard and you know i am just using pot right now 

Recording: (3336/ 8002)

Recording: (3340/ 8002) 
do whatever i want to some degree 

Recording: (3341/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3342/ 8002) 
well actually anybody can try you know there is a civil service exam you hafta take and they place you on a list from that and like say if you have an eighty well everybody that takes it after you that gets an eighty one is gonna get hired before you do uh so you can take it again but if you score lower you gotta keep that lower score so and that sometimes people are you know kind of apprehensive about doing that but uh once you pass that and then they say you know the government goes okay we are ready to hire a thousand people throughout the united states well each region there is regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region so they go down the list the first thirty and they call you know they write each one of them and say we are offering you a position you know do you want it or not and you know some the people have said well i have been on the list for two years and i have a you know like you i have a job and i do not want it now you know so and then those people hafta go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program which is really hard because at one time only forty percent of the people were making it through that 

Recording: (3343/ 8002)

Recording: (3366/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (3367/ 8002) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourself others and i think as as we become older you start thinking about how um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here uh professes to be the thing 

Recording: (3368/ 8002) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is going through who he you know i i have went through that where you know you you look at a woman and you are you she is attractive to you you know but that is just something that is going through your mind and that i think that is like the devil getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would just tell him that is something he is going through and that is wrong for him to do that that he you know he is a man and i would tell him god did not put two men on this earth and if he would choose to do that that i would not hate him or disown him or anything like that 

Recording: (3369/ 8002) 
i went to o u for about three months but i just got out of school you know how it is 

Recording: (3370/ 8002) 
well as it turned out he expected us to play the solos <LAUGH> or did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and um i thought it came out pretty well i have a recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3371/ 8002) 
mm 

Recording: (3372/ 8002) 
he will yeah he will basically tell you he do not have no except for me 

Recording: (3373/ 8002) 
i do it so 

Recording: (3374/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3375/ 8002) 
here in columbus yeah i have i have always lived in columbus yeah 

Recording: (3376/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3377/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3378/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3379/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3380/ 8002) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (3381/ 8002) 
what is different my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle was i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away olentangy village i am right in where i always was i mean i am i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (3382/ 8002) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (3383/ 8002) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit in to certain ones that just everyone of them is different 

Recording: (3384/ 8002) 
south pacific yeah 

Recording: (3385/ 8002) 
it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business school is coming up like they are building a new building but by the i will be gone by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for small school and they just opened up their phd program in education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things um like they it is dry they have uh real strict visitation policies things like that my thought is if you are if you are if you are considered an adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (3386/ 8002) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (3387/ 8002) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (3388/ 8002) 
if if you did not own let us say on a school levy and you did not uh you you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent uh at least it is it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord <LAUGH> uh and i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct f proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because uh a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talked to some i have almost college age students and they do not see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (3389/ 8002) 
umhum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there was something missing in the uh uh the child is life you know uh uh i bet he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building bombs in in their basement and mom and dad not know what was going on you know i mean uh it is just tragedy i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh eleven years old or something like that well an accidental shooting him in him and the uh another friend of mine from the same same class you know um he pulled a gun and shot him you know and did not know that the damn thing was loaded but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid i guess that happened just here in town uh couple about a week ago or something like that you know where a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really you know and who is really to fault and who is really at who is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh not that they would ever would have but if if one of the two that you that you know if they would have survived i would like to seen what was going through their heads you know but that is something we will never know 

Recording: (3390/ 8002) 
that would be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (3391/ 8002) 
you could find it all over the place 

Recording: (3392/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (3393/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3394/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (3395/ 8002) 
and then there was another girl who i really did not think was that smart she is kind of um inner blond and she got in <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (3396/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3397/ 8002) 
i mean whoo they said well since you are getting that why we will cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under the apprenticeship program 

Recording: (3398/ 8002) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (3399/ 8002) 
just mount tapes uh do printouts monitor systems uh people have problems help solve them 

Recording: (3400/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i can not say that they be any difference with them 

Recording: (3401/ 8002) 
it was not a huge shock it was not my first encounter with homosexuality 

Recording: (3402/ 8002) 
umhum yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but um yeah then i was living with my friend for awhile um but and then like now me and her and my other friend live in down on maynard

of the people of this land that there is in a a ceremony called an eneepee which is a sweat lodge and a lot of people will talk about sweat lodge um it involves heating up stones in a fire and uh putting the stones in the lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs it is not a sauna it is not a uh steam room

Recording: (3424/ 8002) 
it is very hard 

Recording: (3425/ 8002) 
um like i said it would just be the old generations with the black president where now it would be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that would be a bigger number

Recording: (3429/ 8002) 
difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (3430/ 8002) 
well it depends i think i would like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites um in the symphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems um because a lot of the people in that group are paid um umhum i get i get paid it is kind of semi professional aspect thing where you get paid per service but um let us see so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for with the amount of music that they want to do <LAUGH> and uh this last year we played a movement of the shuman concert piece for four horns and orchestra and i was a little bit flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody <LAUGH>

yes umhum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean there there are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when you know people are kinda like oh columbus you know there is nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (3450/ 8002) 
um um i was at eugene and i was not even IN EUGENE it was hundred thousand you know and uh i loved that but i then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on the river and it is very uh very scenic very beautiful

Recording: (3462/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (3463/ 8002) 
um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (3464/ 8002) 
yeah because there is no fear of being caught by the parents 

Recording: (3465/ 8002)

Recording: (3469/ 8002) 
being turned away

Recording: (3471/ 8002) 
that is

i knew we i knew we would not go into this too far before this before it came in <LAUGH> umhum <LAUGH> yeah it has it has yeah exactly what you said i mean my dad my whole family are christians and before i left for college my freshman year my dad my dad knows me real well mainly because i am doing almost a mirror image of what he did when he grew up uh aside from the faith that i have um i am very much like him um he wrote out a list of seven things predictions for william is freshman year and every single one of them was accurate it was really really really funny william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and had my bike stolen william will william will and the big one that i was gonna mention was william will either grow in his faith significantly or will go the exact opposite direction and i knew one or the other would happen because i am the i mean my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer oh yeah it was real fun real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm he still does not know it was me but <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> he still does not know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is which is fascinating um but uh you know i mean our first day i walked in he said hey i am tom you ever smoked pot before i was like no he said heck we got a whole year together and and i am directly quoting that this the first thing he said to me that is the first thing he said to me no no he is not but um he and i uh he and i hung out a lot and you know i knew that one of two things was going happen i was gonna follow him and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind doing them every time i doing every time i would have done them i would have known they were wrong or i was going to the opposite direction and i went the opposite direction i got plugged in with uh the some christian groups on campus made some christian friends and hung out with them and and grew a lot grew a lot in acceptance of other people i mean you do not really run into homosexuals in a small rural christian community and if you do they if you do you do not know it because they will shunned out of the community so fast that it is crazy but uh um where was i going with that okay 

Recording: (3537/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3538/ 8002) 
umhum uh they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it most usually i just put location i do not want to go certain places uh 

Recording: (3539/ 8002) 
yeah like when i need things and i call him up i need diapers i need wipes i need twenty dollars yeah he is there for me for that financially yeah he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3540/ 8002) 
no i had no idea where he was uh and at the time my mother in law was in a nursing home had alzheimers and my father in law was in the hospital 

Recording: (3541/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (3542/ 8002) 
and it would take like years i would think to implement the programs successfully 

Recording: (3543/ 8002) 
umhum life skills <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3544/ 8002) 
THATS a like there is no there is not a lot you really you can really do with that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3545/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3546/ 8002) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things i ran into architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (3547/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3548/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (3549/ 8002) 
but it is a uh smaller catholic school you know within saint louis so 

Recording: (3550/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3551/ 8002) 
yeah it is well basically it is like a it is about the size of a very small hotel room and then it is got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub and there is like a they there like oh it is aroma therapy which is a little box on the wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is enough room where people can come and sit down there is like a fold out couch bed for whoever is in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3552/ 8002) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3553/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3554/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3555/ 8002) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior you would go in the morning and your senior you would go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the career center and then you go 

Recording: (3556/ 8002) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to it would probably be more towards the education line 

Recording: (3557/ 8002) 
i mean my the middle brother was always around he was not very social in high school so 

Recording: (3558/ 8002) 
and there is people like that today still you go but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh huh uh and uh sit down make a visit to them every week make it part of life and develop a friendship 

Recording: (3559/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3560/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3561/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (3562/ 8002) 
it is just very comical i was just like uhoh 

Recording: (3563/ 8002) 
yeah okay 

Recording: (3564/ 8002) 
uh it turned him into a zombie 

Recording: (3565/ 8002) 
no commitment do these guys have commitment and you see the guys out there they wanna may go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe something whatever it is you ask each individual what is it drives you and that is the thing you i get so perturbed in interviewers they ask somebody and and somebody comes back and say you know what i mean yeah what did he no i do not get inside the guys mind and i do not what did he mean you know what i mean yeah no i do not know what you mean ya know play dumb it pull it out of them what do you mean uh michael red what do you plan on doing after school when i was growing up they used to give the grade point average in the major of this of the of the student of the student 

Recording: (3566/ 8002) 
a little bit of both i think i looked into some phonics i went to the library checked out some phonic tapes let him watch those cause kids love to watch things <LAUGH> and just reading with him and going over things and it is it is been amazing just to see it is like the light bulb comes on and 

Recording: (3567/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3568/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3569/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3570/ 8002) 
GOOD <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3571/ 8002) 
in your room it is just like forty of any other kind it is plenty 

Recording: (3572/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3573/ 8002) 
umhum me too 

Recording: (3574/ 8002) 
yeah exactly you can bring that in house i think i mean i do not know i might go out like like we said and be completely wrong so 

Recording: (3575/ 8002) 
because that that is happened where he is like i will not do it again and and he did it again i feel like once a cheater always cheater to me you know maybe maybe to the next woman he will not do that to but he is gotten away with it so many times with me i feel like he would not really do it you know 

Recording: (3576/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3577/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3578/ 8002) 
and i have got friends that do that and i just i do not i do not feel right i do not want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff that is no way huhuh <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3579/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3580/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (3581/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3582/ 8002) 
well he is uh exporting cars illegally 

Recording: (3583/ 8002) 
so we are kinda doing that and then i figure i am probably gonna wait tables at night <LAUGH> and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (3584/ 8002) 
i know THOSE ARE hauls 

Recording: (3585/ 8002) 
well i live on the south west side and work in dublin i do not get to campus very much i get to campus but it is usually up to the o s u stadium of the o s u stadium uh studios 

Recording: (3586/ 8002) 
um i probably would like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3587/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> YOURE DOING FINE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3588/ 8002) 
oh sure 

Recording: (3589/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3590/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (3591/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (3592/ 8002) 
but uh her mother stayed with us for several uh two or three years and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy 

Recording: (3593/ 8002) 
and it really is not though because once because i think it is actually it is really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kinda i feel like i can get along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life <LAUGH> for EVERYONE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3594/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3595/ 8002) 
that is that is yeah it is developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school it is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance does not take over till about age eight 

Recording: (3596/ 8002) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers were not there and they had to clean and they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know kids lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents worked i am not sure if the columbine if both parents worked but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no 

Recording: (3597/ 8002) 
okay so you are you are higher up there than i would be 

Recording: (3598/ 8002) 
you know like i told her it is the way i was raised 

Recording: (3599/ 8002) 
i mean forty is like the limit 

Recording: (3600/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (3601/ 8002) 
it is that is why i quit 

Recording: (3602/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3603/ 8002) 
yeah uh it is it to me that is sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done it what the kid did and you do not want him to do it again and let it go they suspended him i do not know course um i probably say this i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so it is probably not the whole story yeah it it is 

Recording: (3604/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (3605/ 8002) 
see and i can not eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to las vegas with my and i we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind glad she did not um the smell of fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out into a rash i mean it was like a heat rash oh it started on my neck 

Recording: (3606/ 8002) 
can you really 

Recording: (3607/ 8002) 
yeah not really i mean i go to like i go to this club axis sometimes i mean that is short north whatever like it is okay um like i do not know i mean the red zone is downtown or whatever i do not go to that i really do not like that place but um i do not know uh kind of the winter months really kill like doing anything like really any like foot traffic type things i mean in the summer it seems like it seems in the winter it seems there is more 

Recording: (3608/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (3609/ 8002) 
humum 

Recording: (3610/ 8002) 
yeah because i have a like a problem with um getting to know people you know like i am shy at first 

Recording: (3611/ 8002) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3612/ 8002) 
and uh it did not hurt me none you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors know it is your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood even and how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3613/ 8002) 
no <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3614/ 8002) 
umhum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they are doing a very good job of that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3615/ 8002) 
yeah yeah i saw the patients in the morning 

Recording: (3616/ 8002) 
oh yeah uh 

Recording: (3617/ 8002) 
i know it is connected to like you know england because it is like i guess that is i guess uh i maybe like england owned it once so that 

Recording: (3618/ 8002) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but uh that is interesting uh um you know when they when the first when the uh when time began you know according my uh what i believe in and everything you know it was man and woman got married you know and and reason they got married was because of procreation you know keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but um if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3619/ 8002) 
i it is not a presidential candidate issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (3620/ 8002)

Recording: (3621/ 8002) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (3622/ 8002) 
you are from where 

Recording: (3623/ 8002)

Recording: (3624/ 8002) 
none of this where have you been SHIT YKNOW 

Recording: (3625/ 8002) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (3626/ 8002) 
well that is right now well a lot of it 

Recording: (3627/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> you have you know like you know the uh typical american tourist

Recording: (3632/ 8002) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (3633/ 8002) 
that it is going to well it might make national news i just 

Recording: (3634/ 8002) 
and i understand that mentality now because i went back but i will tell you the reason i left WAS ITS GONNA sound stupid but he took my teddy bear which i loved and had for not since i was a child but at least five years at that time and he just he knew i loved it

Recording: (3641/ 8002)

Recording: (3646/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3647/ 8002)

Recording: (3648/ 8002) 
well and 

Recording: (3649/ 8002) 
umhum yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those my father would not allow it because uh it was integrated 

Recording: (3650/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (3651/ 8002) 
no it is not 

Recording: (3652/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3653/ 8002) 
it is easy to <LAUGH> 

Recording: (3654/ 8002) 
it is getting so congested it is that is what i do not like 

Recording: (3655/ 8002) 
no and other towns just do not 

Recording: (3656/ 8002) 
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh when they were planning this thing and with uh with ohio state to uh you know like have the schottenstein center down at uh down closer to downtown or or something like that and play half your ball games there or something like that but but ohio state do not need that you know they got their own stuff so 

Recording: (3657/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3658/ 8002) 
well i do not think they should be responsible i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties you know the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot um and i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is always have to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked and all these big large classrooms and it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a clique together you know would be hard for them to intervene and say say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that is that is not really should be their role but um if they care enough they should call the parents and say look we are worried about your son he misses lot of school or he is starting to dress really ynkow i sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if they do not want to be in sports that is fine there are so many different things they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and you know but um unfortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can not do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3659/ 8002) 
columbus public 

Recording: (3660/ 8002)

by the end i was pretty much just puking up blood and passing out a lot 

Recording: (3665/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (3666/ 8002)

Recording: (3906/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> um not to sound like a broken record but i really think it is our uh backslide on on family units i think it is too easy to stay and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me um that it is too easy to get divorced um people do not really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i do not wanna say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important um because lets face it to to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i wanna smack him and he is being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and lo and behold an hour later week later what WHATEVER LONG IT takes i am in love with him again i mean really you know what i am saying and um i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of a just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment um unfortunately i think that is the problem parents um are a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you know using the kid as a medium um or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did not i i do not wanna say selfish but lets face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um not spend enough time with the kids you know they are working what not and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that uh and i do not think enough families are doing that

when he died um i was about thirty 

Recording: (3982/ 8002) 
that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident uh there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not die you do not physically maybe you know there is no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it will not

mmhmm 

Recording: (4010/ 8002) 
and it it is you know my mom you know she always you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kinda neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (4011/ 8002) 
yes to but that uh more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is a because of a loss of a parent or inability of a uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage though scott 

Recording: (4012/ 8002) 
yeah that could be right yeah 

Recording: (4013/ 8002) 
well and do not you think too the that the more they have found out psychologically speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the um throes of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the that experience from being one of eleven children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (4014/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4015/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4016/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (4017/ 8002)

Recording: (4021/ 8002)

Recording: (4025/ 8002) 
hum 

Recording: (4026/ 8002) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (4027/ 8002) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing <LAUGH> although what is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (4028/ 8002) 
for example so you should name her tamara 

Recording: (4029/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4030/ 8002) 
most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved in their with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (4031/ 8002) 
which kids 

Recording: (4032/ 8002) 
i 

Recording: (4033/ 8002) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not say anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you would run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (4034/ 8002) 
that he did not 

Recording: (4035/ 8002) 
well i have been see i was not much i my being here and my daughter being there i did not really have the uh time with her that i wished i would have had you know but uh uh her mother would you know would not did her all right and everything but i wished that i would have been more involved in her growing up and i think two people families are generally better you know for not necessarily living being you know its about being married and everything but 

Recording: (4036/ 8002) 
basically because the plans which the utilities had for our locations they could not provide to us because of the uh the vesture ruling so we had to go out and um do our own surveys become self educated through uh courses uh through a t t and through purdue university it was i think o u had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but uh the projects basically we were going from a um putting together a network itself and uh we had a you think of a party line system what they used call daisy chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to a data network and we got down to point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had dedicated pipe 

Recording: (4037/ 8002) 
i am from columbus ohio i was born and raised in columbus uh i grew up on the east side of columbus i graduated from high school i then started working for ohio state in nineteen seventy seven and have been there here for twenty four years 

Recording: (4038/ 8002)

oh it is just so the environment of course is incredibly beautiful um and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and um you know i think it is a much friendlier place and then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live a simple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the ECONOMY IN OREGON is not that great but you know they say in eugene that even the dishwashers have p h d is they <LAUGH> well the the um the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country

Recording: (4058/ 8002) 
are not there other important roles what would those nuns be where would your mother possibly been if she went to catholic school i take it where would she have been if it were not for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for and they had a very important role for your development even though you are generation is removed 

Recording: (4059/ 8002) 
but i am like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (4060/ 8002) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i do not think that there is anything violent or that THERES anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focuses on the one is that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school is like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that 

Recording: (4061/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4062/ 8002)

Recording: (4067/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4068/ 8002)

Recording: (4077/ 8002)

Recording: (4078/ 8002) 
oh my gosh it was a it was it was just unbelievable he got really sick after that rush week yeah really sick so they want him to move in the fraternity house he can not really afford it but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he is like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so i am thinking they might help him out a little bit they want him in the house real bad 

Recording: (4079/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4080/ 8002) 
basically uh it is just the talk and stuff it is not uh like you know what i mean uh i am black i am better or i am white i am better it is it is none of that 

Recording: (4081/ 8002) 
um it is an ego trip that is all basically it is like look i can do this 

Recording: (4082/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4083/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (4084/ 8002) 
it is just 

Recording: (4085/ 8002) 
nope huh um 

Recording: (4086/ 8002) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was the and when he was or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finish school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money i mean we do not need to have a ton but we just should be at least a little out of debt AND SO yeah <LAUGH> something 

Recording: (4087/ 8002) 
well the main thing is they never leave they do not they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest g p a of any college 

Recording: (4088/ 8002) 
they 

Recording: (4089/ 8002) 
a parakeet yes little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (4090/ 8002) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progression that needs to be made um i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who is a fellow history major her and actually her brother is a fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know him all that well which apparently her family i mean she is she is double major in history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it painfully clear that when it she should not plan on having a career because she is gonna hafta raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my belief uh and and the fact that it is like the males telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think an individual individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dieing out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh i think uh uh we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (4091/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4092/ 8002) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (4093/ 8002) 
yeah the big things 

Recording: (4094/ 8002) 
uh huh 

Recording: (4095/ 8002) 
but when he did have something to do with him it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (4096/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4097/ 8002) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we knew we knew a lot of stuff we were gonna we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are gonna regret this someday i said another ten years we will be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent uh so it gets to point that when we were first married pretty it was hard to make it simple decision on anything you know we have worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own or anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teachers said independent we said it said stubborn but it is like even go to mcdonalds or something and he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and and tell them 

Recording: (4098/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4099/ 8002) 
so if you if you you can not you could not bring any any like pet is back say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the states so you have to leave all those 

Recording: (4100/ 8002) 
and it is if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebel 

Recording: (4101/ 8002) 
yeah the media exposure <LAUGH>

Recording: (4104/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4105/ 8002) 
it is like you are doing interviews 

Recording: (4106/ 8002) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (4107/ 8002) 
oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months and uh and uh i went to the produce stand and i took my umbrella and of course it does not rain too <lauchmuchin> <LAUGH> CALIFORNIA and i said oh i am from oregon and i always think it is gonna rain and he says well i am from washington and i know ITS GONNA RAIN 

Recording: (4108/ 8002)

Recording: (4109/ 8002) 
so if you want get to me two more minutes a play okay now you got another leg but the thing is let me ask you question how does that impact you if you can not be a priest are not there other important quote unquote roles for women in the church are not there other important roles

Recording: (4118/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4119/ 8002) 
i think i would say the same thing because uh um course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness and um 

Recording: (4120/ 8002) 
why is that 

Recording: (4121/ 8002) 
<LAUGH>

Recording: (4153/ 8002) 
two years 

Recording: (4154/ 8002) 
that is good 

Recording: (4155/ 8002)

Recording: (4156/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4157/ 8002)

Recording: (4164/ 8002) 
they would uh heard it all before and they some of them had known me for a few years but uh i was told i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else i do not believe THAT <LAUGH> <LAUGH> yeah umhum 

Recording: (4165/ 8002) 
i at this point i blame it on the administration um and the citizens of columbus have not i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levy you should never defeat a school levy 

Recording: (4166/ 8002) 
yeah they would just kick him to the hallway he was either you know in the hallway or in uh the office and and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions 

Recording: (4167/ 8002) 
and i could not walk at all 

Recording: (4168/ 8002) 
that makes it hard like if you got like a if like you and you got a family you know you know you take you if you you wanted to like spend the night on the town with your you know with your family man that is that kinda like blows your whole budget for the year 

Recording: (4169/ 8002)

which was a a going thing 

Recording: (4173/ 8002)

Recording: (4174/ 8002) 
i am 

Recording: (4175/ 8002) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (4176/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4177/ 8002) 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (4178/ 8002) 
i think when you have TWO OR MORE <LAUGH> pets you hafta make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (4179/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4180/ 8002) 
yeah it was pretty much upper middle class 

Recording: (4181/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4182/ 8002) 
yeah probably cause we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but there is some for public too 

Recording: (4183/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4184/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (4185/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> YOU want some gossip the gossip i heard was that um um the superintendent of schools said that if HE WAS REELECTED SHE WAS GOING TO RESIGN AND SO THEY GAVE HER A BIG RAISE <LAUGH> SO HE SHE MUST BE A THORN IN HER SIDE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4186/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4187/ 8002) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of a uh how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law you know it could be something real real technical or something that a three year old could answer because it is trying to hit you know all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (4188/ 8002) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (4189/ 8002) 
i do not know somehow or OTHER YEAH <LAUGH> and if they if everybody would just begin to feel that way and when they start to say something nasty would think would i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (4190/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (4191/ 8002) 
i hope not some of these mongers that goes around and always predicts the worst things like everybody saying at the end two thousand happens do not go out and celebrate new years the world is gonna end well how is it gonna end you know and 

Recording: (4192/ 8002) 
that was a lot of old thinking 

Recording: (4193/ 8002) 
no offense it is easier than trying to call up 

Recording: (4194/ 8002) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (4195/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> i seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder it is like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (4196/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (4197/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4198/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just wanna shoot somebody unfortunately anybody that says that i i mean i am i do not even like stepping on ants but there is those moments where you are like 

Recording: (4199/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4200/ 8002) 
umhum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh ah it seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (4201/ 8002) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i am thinking i may get into that <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4202/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (4203/ 8002) 
does not even 

Recording: (4204/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (4205/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4206/ 8002) 
umhum okay 

Recording: (4207/ 8002) 
well i do not know if it is monroe county or 

Recording: (4208/ 8002) 
it is just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they are gonna be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (4209/ 8002) 
i do not know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (4210/ 8002) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well it is my choice oh god my husband is a lot better at these type of questions cause he was methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was exposed to his it is like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser then mine and <LAUGH> just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and uh being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (4211/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4212/ 8002) 
oh yeah i think everybody should if nothing else you missed your boat by that time 

Recording: (4213/ 8002) 
you can not see it in a day 

Recording: (4214/ 8002) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (4215/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4216/ 8002) 
oh that is good that is good 

Recording: (4217/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4218/ 8002) 
um so i think that part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um where like said i have already done all the stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (4219/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4220/ 8002) 
and would not you like them to see that you know look 

Recording: (4221/ 8002) 
even my mother who is a she said if nixon were running today she would vote for him she is that much of a conservative uh agrees with what is happened but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but at this point i do not think there really was a a few months ago yeah but 

Recording: (4222/ 8002) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and told me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than that because man every time we go over there he is up on the computer doing something so and i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um you know like reading about things that happen to people like their kids spitting up in their face or something 

Recording: (4223/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4224/ 8002) 
and uh i said our our engineers they are not engineers per se but they are techies that are really in to this they they enjoy their work and it is for it is in the forefront of ohio government along with the technology there has to also be the paperwork now i know realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (4225/ 8002) 
a little bit faster uh but and then in then when i get out of service like at twenty two you know i was kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleanliness and next to godliness and all that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (4226/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (4227/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (4228/ 8002) 
yeah they like they really like this town she was from kentucky appalachia 

Recording: (4229/ 8002) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (4230/ 8002) 
and i was not real i was more surprised that they found a lot of like alcohol like i would not like you know like some people if they do drugs at school and stuff i am not saying that is right but they will they will do it but like alcohol it would be so hard to like hide because it SMELLS you know and you GOTTA hold it out but they found like bottles of liquor and 

Recording: (4231/ 8002) 
no i do not go to mass everyday but i go on sunday

Recording: (4267/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4268/ 8002) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seemed like the way the world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you wanna really live a half way decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to just use like you SAID the necessities 

Recording: (4269/ 8002) 
umhum

mm yeah i hope we are gonna get there <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4276/ 8002) 
i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it caused any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (4277/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4278/ 8002) 
right <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4279/ 8002)

umhum 

Recording: (4303/ 8002) 
and that the the the people who whom most face that lie are the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation um so what i mean civil rights was an an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today there are uh i mean it i see a a growing movement of people who want to who curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and it is not our generation who is curtailing it it is still the uh like our parents generation um 

Recording: (4304/ 8002) 
yeah my one sister my older sister she is uh got one son he is

and they are actually offered an early retirement because the funds i do not you may not remember about three years ago four years ago the the federal government was not gonna pass a budget and all this stuff so when that does not happen on budget cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that WHICH WAS ACTUALLY more money than they were gonna give us before that uh so they had to they would either have go lay off people or offer retirement so i took the retirement because i was not happy there anyway so then took couple months off and did some consulting was worked on a consulting project at a borden is for about six months then when that project ended just same time it ended my father in law was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they do not they were from chilicothe so uh i became his caregiver for about three months till he died and then took a couple months off and started working part time at the symphony have been since then

Recording: (4327/ 8002) 
moss <LAUGH> BILL MOSS HES ALWAYS SAYING oh this is and that is but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know there are places lots like the south and so on course uh who who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (4328/ 8002) 
is extraordinarily similar um so what she says might not might be diametric opposed to what i say 

Recording: (4329/ 8002) 
so it is kinda hard you know what i mean to do a lotta things 

Recording: (4330/ 8002) 
yeah hey everybody has it right 

Recording: (4331/ 8002) 
i do not know where the children ever picked up but i am sure that they were not born that way because there have been a lot of them who have been married had kids and i know one and then when he got the divorce i do not know why he changed his mind and started to living with the uh with the guys 

Recording: (4332/ 8002) 
except for last year no i am just kidding <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4333/ 8002) 
well see that is like a big thing you do not understand when northland shopping center closed down and all the where where i am at they got so many of them strip malls like you are talking about with stores out of them 

Recording: (4334/ 8002) 
and i am one of those go in get what you want and get the heck out you know and

Recording: (4336/ 8002) 
i do because they were not you know they were not in their children is lives enough you know they were not talking about things being open about things at dinner you know finding out about school um i you can not blame them for having a site on the internet not too many parents would know that that they their kids you know um but no i think i i i put the blame on the parents 

Recording: (4337/ 8002) 
right but still my my oldest daughter were for a long time she was in theater and people would say to me how do you feel about that and i said what do you mean how i feel about that you know she can always wait tables as long as she can support herself self what do i care and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology and now as it turns out she is going to um she just started back she is the one that is having the baby though she is just started back and uh to get certified to teach elementary school because we have talked so much about what where would she do well and she she would just do so well she is really good she is such a kid herself she is really good with with kids maybe second third grade she is so into animals and so into science and understands different kids so that you know i i think she would be fabulous there and so she is kind of decided but if that if she ends up not doing that i will not care either

Recording: (4339/ 8002) 
i think they have tried to to uh bring the laymen in to more of the priest the duties of the priest but there is like the consecration uh of the bread and wine that that none of that has been sanctioned they do not perform they do not uh uh um they are not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism confirmation holy uh well they do holy communion but uh extreme unction matrimony none of those uh have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest but um i still think that it is a good uh i do think the involvement of the laymen is very important but i do not have any i i mean that does not bother me a bit about women 

Recording: (4340/ 8002) 
yeah um you are you yeah you may be right could be could be 

Recording: (4341/ 8002) 
i like computers i like

Recording: (4346/ 8002) 
yeah um the second thing would be uh the um cultural activities that we have um i wexner center would be one of my primary ones because there is so much going on down there but the art museum and um uh oh right that cultural arts center and columbus music hall i mean there is just a million things 

Recording: (4347/ 8002)

oh the japanese come too 

Recording: (4352/ 8002) 
um freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a clique you try to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (4353/ 8002) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it is i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer um and you know i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is and i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily um i i i do not know it is a tough one and i mean your daughter uh you said daughter is yeah is still young so you have to deal with but is scary you send your kid to school and you hear these things and it is just no matter where it is in the country or the world you hear of it you know really worries you 

Recording: (4354/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> <LAUGH> you should be real attentive to what is happening in his school situation his or her 

Recording: (4355/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4356/ 8002) 
so she is and hopefully they will get married soon they have been together for over a year and a half 

Recording: (4357/ 8002) 
you know why 

Recording: (4358/ 8002) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (4359/ 8002) 
and neither one of these folks could answer it yes or no and they are going just answer yes or no they will tell you well i think i stated my point very clearly when i was no the answer is yes or is it was it was um healthcare for living partners um it is a simple question yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that you know and i know that that from a p r stand point you do not wanna you do not wanna shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like the damn it you know if you are running for office you should just just be up front 

Recording: (4360/ 8002) 
well right now i think he knows enough i am just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i am pretty i am like wow i can not even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and cars and rockets an <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4361/ 8002) 
right <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4362/ 8002) 
just i think it is uh a to reflect the the uh um beliefs that we are trying to carry and and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i am not saying that it is terrible it but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff then it somebody might not believe that they have anything credible to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more respectfully that to you know i mean most the people will accept you if you are dressed in a dress whereas i mean even a person in a nose ring will will respect you but but then you are in a you are at a disadvantage if you do not <LAUGH> dress in a certain way 

Recording: (4363/ 8002) 
they they definitely struggle it they do some i i think to be that high up obviously you are gonna come in contact with powerful peoplerich people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not know i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the republicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (4364/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (4365/ 8002) 
my background 

Recording: (4366/ 8002)

Recording: (4374/ 8002) 
o s u 

Recording: (4375/ 8002) 
and i looked at it i thought introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader THAN THAT so i ended up coming up with a class that was it was an only nine weeks too it was only nine classes um so was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks and uh i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly uh visual art and for the second three weeks we talked about music and the uh development of music various aspects and for the last three weeks we talked about theater actually for the two of the last three weeks we talked about theater and for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera <LAUGH> so for a lot of these kids you know from it was an introduction to uh it was an introduction to a lot of things they may might not have been exposed to <LAUGH> yeah

i know that is why you have to get it recorded <LAUGH> it it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they are on a shoestring they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count in kind contribution the uh otterbein college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and uh salary the conductor uh so that is a huge an amount of money they put into it what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in orchestra so uh sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh but once in a while we will get wind players play in it also and um sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something you wanted to play <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4467/ 8002) 
<LAUGH>

and then as the community fanned out then they had bigger houses i like living in the old area better i like the houses in the new area better there is one in particular that is just gorgeous

Recording: (4548/ 8002) 
they they it is just set up uh on a flat bed truck on wall street in new york and do a concert there <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4549/ 8002) 
compared to you you will have more loyalty i would think and at the same time those people will not be thinking about being hungry while they are on the line working for you 

Recording: (4550/ 8002) 
umhum but you know when he first came here he said that you could not win here because he had too many slow white guys so 

Recording: (4551/ 8002) 
when they drove by i guess 

Recording: (4552/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4553/ 8002) 
yeah because uh they are more you always hear about my black ass my you know what i mean and stuff like this and i could give a shit 

Recording: (4554/ 8002) 
if not you just get the the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are gonna get that no matter what and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (4555/ 8002) 
um i i i when i was growing up i had i had a whole litter of cats 

Recording: (4556/ 8002) 
yeah and yeah and i would not do that i if i was you know had no children and 

Recording: (4557/ 8002) 
so you know um it it is pretty pretty busy there but it it is spread out over the sixteen hours is where as port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes in an hours time so 

Recording: (4558/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4559/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4560/ 8002) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (4561/ 8002) 
and just ya know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it was always something different i have to be outside and it was just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (4562/ 8002) 
yeah it has not it has not gone far as loan sharking but you know the the thing of it is it is fun when you win and it is still fun when you lose i mean you know just 

Recording: (4563/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (4564/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (4565/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (4566/ 8002) 
no not at all i would have rather voted for mccain over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which i am not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like everything is been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (4567/ 8002) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (4568/ 8002)

Recording: (4570/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4571/ 8002) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and polaris and umhum um i do not know it is northland is such a a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um a hurting or you know a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both there is lazarus everywhere there is sears everywhere why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to polaris if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah we will probably move within the year umhum

Recording: (4782/ 8002) 
now how can you do that yeah 

Recording: (4783/ 8002) 
and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (4784/ 8002) 
yeah it was yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (4785/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> yeah right real war <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4786/ 8002) 
right and it is all the bucks yeah because people i work with you know uh there uh there are some people i work with that house payments one guy he has the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a month and a lot of them have like fifteen hundred and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago and it is like four eighty five and i would not dare tell them that but it is like you know they because they are always at you know there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they have gotta have the best of everything the best of it is like you know you know you i to me you just hafta kind of think about things little bit and it is like you know do i do i really need to go to um oh what would i say um uh t g i fridays for lunch and spend twelve dollars can i go to taco bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like a book for my kid or you know uh they have like my daughter is in swimming i need the money for a swimsuit well why do not i use it for that you know so it is 

Recording: (4787/ 8002) 
yeah they were pro strike were getting money on buck i d is but yeah 

Recording: (4788/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4789/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4790/ 8002) 
well it is gotta come from the top you know i i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction so i would say you know it is an organizational problem with no you know no motivation uh you know to do their job you know properly now i live down the street from what they call cahs it is the columbus uh alternative high school and uh you get there through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarships uh my son went there one year uh uh it was a disaster for him 

Recording: (4791/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4792/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4793/ 8002) 
because they are they have enough money to buy new things and they do not want to necessarily send it down i do not think to the salvation army or the i i do not know but i think that they think that there is a better way of giving away and like good will they resell and salvation army they resell well we we 

Recording: (4794/ 8002) 
happened sometime um probably would have been my my freshman year in high school um we were just walking down high street and <LAUGH> i guess we were wrong place at the wrong time and some people were like yelling stuff and we could not make out what they were saying 

Recording: (4795/ 8002) 
or something like that just for something to do 

Recording: (4796/ 8002) 
absolutely 

Recording: (4797/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4798/ 8002) 
YEAH AND she is just like yeah the minute we walk in the door it is like you guys clock out <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4799/ 8002) 
great 

Recording: (4800/ 8002) 
uh huh 

Recording: (4801/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4802/ 8002) 
i personally do not believe that they should be allowed to because i believe they they should have the male gender as well as the female gender for a proper bringing up 

Recording: (4803/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4804/ 8002) 
but they but then in the very next breath they said well in two weeks we are going to california to visit paul now now and anyhow i was telling each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this and they are all going oh mom my older girls are going oh you know and my my daughter who is thirteen is fabulous she is so blunt she is such she is just so out there and so different from so many other children um and she said well do you actually care if he comes here you do not care do you and i said well i do not care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings 

Recording: (4805/ 8002) 
definitely i definitely the way i feel the death penalty is wrong but uh i do not know people are always like oh you know if your mother if your mother was killed god forbid but like you would want the death penalty but honestly i do not think i would i really like i would feel angry towards that person but killing them does not help me with my maybe the families say it helps with closure and everything but i that to me is it is displacing my anger in a way that actually i do not think the my victim that i was so close to me would want me to do you know so 

Recording: (4806/ 8002) 
that is awfully young but again he is got this baby yet they did not talk about how this baby how you make a baby or everything and i do not know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it is just like okay 

Recording: (4807/ 8002) 
they are dear 

Recording: (4808/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4809/ 8002) 
oh boy i said and this and here i here i come from this is a gentlemen that is uh dark skin i do not know if he is black or colored i am still confused as to what difference in black and colored is but uh he says you know my brothers probably came to these islands to the to the continental they come down here and they are getting all they are swaying themselves they are acting cocky to me and so forth and i say we do not do that here and i said well i know this you know uh there is a lot of black population here creole mix and that type of thing which i would consider colored not black uh to me black is black if you have anything mixed in you it is colored uh but he said uh we do not do that uh he said problem in the states gosh you guys daddy wants kid wants a car get him a car down here child only comes from the school i uh i gave him a dinner but i ask him to sweep off the front porch now i will still give him his dinner but i ask him please did you do your sweep the front porch may not sound much but at least i am trying to teach him something and you you saw all that down there in the people where we were down fredericksburg but uh it it is it is just those things you you learn and and there is other times i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw very impoverished uh area so i 

Recording: (4810/ 8002) 
and uh then while she was out there she met a a cowboy who was from also from ohio and uh they uh they were married while they were out there i guess but uh she was <LAUGH> uh my son used to say she was a piece of work she <LAUGH> she had not definite ideas about pretty near everything 

Recording: (4811/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4812/ 8002) 
yeah that was IT that is hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you are just like wow wait what were those people thinking umhum yeah 

Recording: (4813/ 8002) 
yeah you uh i you know i have just come to i always you know prefer for my children and myself i mean uh if there is anything disney i usually go and watch it you know at the movie theater and after a while it is like i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me it is like that is a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it 

Recording: (4814/ 8002) 
um secretarial administrative assistant type work 

Recording: (4815/ 8002) 
it is 

Recording: (4816/ 8002) 
as it was jacob is sold the northland mall anyway so it is probably gonna be like a a strip mall more or less 

Recording: (4817/ 8002) 
uh hum 

Recording: (4818/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4819/ 8002) 
yeah that yeah umhum i think the mother has more of an instinct for that but as far as the studies go where the people roll over their babies i do not see how you can roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean 

Recording: (4820/ 8002) 
well see that is not proved out by the the approval ratings he still has higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that um that you know people do not like all the crap that went with him as the on tv you know they say that and they are they are still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elizabeth dole they would not have been able to attack on the issues so they would find other things to get get her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people did not care about it they did not care about it before the election they did not care about it during his campaign they did not care about it during his presidency it was some republican right wing i do not know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate you know he may have been a cad you know he may have you know but she was twentyone it is not like it was someone who could not make up her own mind what she wanted to do you know and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i do not wanna know about it on day one when it hit the the news i did not want to know about it and on the end when he was you know not impeached i did not wanna know about it and in between i did not wanna know about it and they just kept angering me because there were other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women is rights and and things that are important to people you know they they have tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of you know giving a tax cut people do not want a tax cut when it is going to affect their social security or affect you know uh the the the deficit 

Recording: (4821/ 8002) 
yeah that and i think i i am a firm believer that uh little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than look in the mirror and going look at them hips and you go this one you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (4822/ 8002) 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against him and that is what i would i want my you know my son to keep i want him to know his father and be around him even though he is not the best best of person but you know 

Recording: (4823/ 8002) 
oh no and it turns out it was the the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the for the guys and i did not like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it was not resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha 

Recording: (4824/ 8002) 
um aerospace industry my dad uh had a degree in um engineering uh uh what kind of engineering drafting engineering i think and um worked for in california and they asked him to move to the north american plant here in columbus out near the airport when it was north american before it became rockwell and um that is why we moved here and that is why i grew up on the east side it was close to there <LAUGH> and um and when i was one year old we took a car trip across the COUNTRY <LAUGH> i do not remember much of it BUT <LAUGH> that is how we moved <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4825/ 8002)

Recording: (4832/ 8002) 
you you what it is is most people want do not want kids to live in reality 

Recording: (4833/ 8002)

Recording: (4835/ 8002) 
hm 

Recording: (4836/ 8002)

Recording: (4845/ 8002) 
<LAUGH>

Recording: (4851/ 8002) 
i would not doubt it i hope they vote against it but i do not think they will 

Recording: (4852/ 8002) 
umhum but there is things that are difficult like there the where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to fit fit certain criteria they have to be baptized and not and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and but that is not what they are interested in doing SO and and that is hard i think and like going on a mission really they did not understand that they are my dad was like do they know how small you are they are sending you to siberia so 

Recording: (4853/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4854/ 8002) 
in 

Recording: (4855/ 8002) 
ok 

Recording: (4856/ 8002) 
not really i mean yeah there is some little flaws but 

Recording: (4857/ 8002)

Recording: (4858/ 8002) 
and my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like hey what can i do and she just like calm down rachel just calm down and 

Recording: (4859/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (4860/ 8002) 
go go go so it is tough 

Recording: (4861/ 8002) 
i do not know 

Recording: (4862/ 8002) 
well just like premarital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you did not 

Recording: (4863/ 8002) 
it was pretty much deliver papers go to class wrestling sleep 

Recording: (4864/ 8002) 
does it 

Recording: (4865/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4866/ 8002)

Recording: (4867/ 8002) 
well the furniture the dining room sets the the uh chairs the couches 

Recording: (4868/ 8002)

Recording: (4869/ 8002) 
they are going to come and ask you so no matter what you say 

Recording: (4870/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4871/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4872/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4873/ 8002) 
i do not know there that much detail but most time it comes down to a lack of uh knowing your your children how they are gonna react to certain things oh what it is uh i do not know details with thing other than the fact that they are seem like there is lot emptiness going on uh with them and uh and i think that is part of problem we have in our uh in our life i have uh i it would be very difficult um i think uh in our in traveling if you say okay i am gonna give up this life here and go to the third world and live or else do less less reverse bussing hey okay upper arlington you live northwest side why you down and live on the east side 

Recording: (4874/ 8002)

Recording: (4876/ 8002) 
seventy seven 

Recording: (4877/ 8002) 
you could argue both of those too but i me personally i would say that is just teaching them more than what they need to KNOW <LAUGH> i i think that is a little bit too much 

Recording: (4878/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> oh yeah 

Recording: (4879/ 8002) 
well it is not every sunday anymore uh but it was for a long time it was for a long time

Recording: (4881/ 8002) 
so you knew you have heard about that probably 

Recording: (4882/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (4883/ 8002) 
and the they are not willing to do that for gifted students 

Recording: (4884/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4885/ 8002) 
and you are not being recorded now 

Recording: (4886/ 8002)

Recording: (4887/ 8002) 
what and the first episode the first half was excellent had the cigarette smoking man just it was from his perspective he was talking that then the second half got like 

Recording: (4888/ 8002)

Recording: (4890/ 8002) 
and then was or uh sort of good 

Recording: (4891/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4892/ 8002) 
yeah it is true and she likes it she is really good at it and and drives my my stepdad CRAZY <LAUGH> BECAUSE because she will always be like hey pete can you come over and put these cabinets IN YKNOW he says i do not wanna do ANYTHING ELSE but um 

Recording: (4893/ 8002) 
uh my dad is remarried 

Recording: (4894/ 8002) 
just getting over there 

Recording: (4895/ 8002) 
they had this thing about um the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breast fed have higher i q is 

Recording: (4896/ 8002) 
yeah he was up there too the old guy with beard and uh tweed jacket you know it was pretty cool and uh they said most you know most of the students are not even from delawere 

Recording: (4897/ 8002) 
you go to RIGHT RIGHT right well i started going to sunday school when i was five or six years old 

Recording: (4898/ 8002) 
i thought that was just something like maybe unique unique to the states 

Recording: (4899/ 8002) 
that is one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was we were shopping for schools systems just as much you know so and i do not want to buy a house and i do not want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system so because it seems like since we have bought our house the houses are just doubling and tripling in value it is yeah oh i do not know ours is increased quite a lot since we have been there but we have been there i guess about ten years um we live rented in grandview 

Recording: (4900/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> WERE we are finished <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4901/ 8002) 
um it would a little bit but at thesametime i mean it was obviously a long time ago i mean i do not know how how far in the past you have to go for thingsto be considered a problem of something coming up again um i mean as long as he is not did not have any history of being like an addicted user or anything like that i mean i i can not say it really bothers me too much 

Recording: (4902/ 8002) 
just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness forgiveness is granted whatever 

Recording: (4903/ 8002) 
oh he said he is going to kick my you know what and everything i said well be outside you know 

Recording: (4904/ 8002) 
yep 

Recording: (4905/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (4906/ 8002) 
uh huh 

Recording: (4907/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4908/ 8002)

Recording: (4909/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (4910/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4911/ 8002) 
so um there is from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it 

Recording: (4912/ 8002) 
i have been in the same house for seventeen years 

Recording: (4913/ 8002) 
i 

Recording: (4914/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (4915/ 8002) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (4916/ 8002) 
the problem is lack of commitment the lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a niche for you you can not be a male oh yeah you wanna do the operation i can not be feeling yeah you wanna do well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can not be 

Recording: (4917/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (4918/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (4919/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (4920/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (4921/ 8002) 
yeah i do not think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life 

Recording: (4922/ 8002) 
i would get more people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i am making about ten or eleven bucks an hour

Recording: (4940/ 8002) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is exacerbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class

Recording: (4983/ 8002) 
well there is um i mean i am pretty much you just keep making calls making appointments sending out slides um it helps if you can get a you know if you know an artist who is in a gallery um you know if you can use them as a as a reference um but that it is it is mainly just you just have to uh knock on a lot of doors and be prepared for a lot of of no is 

Recording: (4984/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> man and you are loving it too <LAUGH> at least at least you are trying to convince yourself of it you are not <LAUGH> 

Recording: (4985/ 8002) 
um i have always heard and i am i am very clean anyways but you know when you hafta vacuum a lot and everything and you are constantly picking up that dander rather than just let it sit and accumulate

not doing anything my son uh you know with his disorder he would constantly be uh late for school and i uh called the school and told them this was in high school 

Recording: (4998/ 8002) 
so family um familiarity and um just the community i think crime i think it is going up and up um traffic is HORRENDOUS but the one but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is expanding so much that we need the orange brailles and um i guess the lack of publicity nationally i i we do not have you know like the national football teams and now with the hockey coming i i think were getting more recognition but when people talk about columbus they then i do not think they know columbus ohio or columbus georgia or columbus where right 

Recording: (4999/ 8002) 
no there is a lot of people go to church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know uh uh makes you a better human being than another human being i believe that the you know your i believe that most people with basic uh structure in their life if it is based similar to the bible or you could say buddhism or whatever you know uh uh that you will tend to have a better life than you will if you practice non quote unquote religious religious ways but i do not believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person uh becausethere is a lot of hypocrites that go to church now these kids i i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i i remember hearing it a lot about too was they they were picked on 

Recording: (5000/ 8002) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (5001/ 8002)

Recording: (5009/ 8002) 
boy i you know i i do not not having kids and then you know not being that close to it it is hard to know i mean i have always i have always thought that that um what their friends did and what they what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as as anything that that the school could do but i know the school school is a very powerful force in a kid is life you know i mean it is a kid is life 

Recording: (5010/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5011/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (5012/ 8002)

Recording: (5015/ 8002) 
i mean you talk to people in the catholic church about the unseen meaning the spiritual realm and they freak out 

Recording: (5016/ 8002) 
uh well the problem is is um like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their business men there at eight a m well an airport has so many runways and so many taxi ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and staying up there and hold while they are uh you know shooting them in what they do is they uh like uh say going to ohare they will you hafta call for release times at these different airports and they will say well uh he can not go right now but he can go like at twenty seven past the hour so he they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is airlines that cause it themself it is like uh you know like you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room at ten oclock today well rather than say why do not some of you come at ten and another group come at ten fifteen another group and we are all trying to do the same thing at once and it does not work you know you you can not get you can only get so many people through that door and if you say well i am gonna take five at a time well they can get in but if you say i am taking five hundred at time it does not work and so the airlines always go well it is the government and regulations and blah blah blah that is why we are delayed and it is really them themselves because they are 

Recording: (5017/ 8002) 
to make me healthier or whatever because i have always been really healthy 

Recording: (5018/ 8002) 
oh really 

Recording: (5019/ 8002)

Recording: (5025/ 8002) 
watertown 

Recording: (5026/ 8002)

Recording: (5027/ 8002) 
because they like it they like school and that is why they came to college football was secondary 

Recording: (5028/ 8002)

Recording: (5030/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5031/ 8002) 
uh well i am very much my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh being a vegetarian and uh um and uh most of our wars i would have <LAUGH> SAID NO LETS NOT DO THIS yet although on the other hand i i have to admit that there has been some stuff that we have not been able to stop without it um and and that is too bad you know that things things are have been that bad in some like oh world war two i mean we did not really have any choice there not that but uh some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh so but you know you can get you can get a philosophy but it does not have always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the the guy that they um uh executed here in ohio last fall did you know about it you 

Recording: (5032/ 8002) 
really oh my god and then you can hash mark them if you want we did not but you could <LAUGH> and we had two people who who um said you are kidding and then said never mind i am sorry pretend i never even said that i was like wow somebody must have done this before <LAUGH> because everybody is just like there is no other response but 

Recording: (5033/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5034/ 8002) 
it would almost be better if they let the dog go over because you know she is gonna bring in mud and grass and it is not gonna be perfect maybe knock something over you know kind of start with her but you have to go home you know what i mean 

Recording: (5035/ 8002) 
kids because they are only little once that is what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated they are only little once and they will be grown up before i know it BECAUSE 

Recording: (5036/ 8002) 
that is that is what i would i would think in that case i i mean because the dominant culture it i mean is always gonna be accessible to them 

Recording: (5037/ 8002) 
for everybody so you have you want to go to ivy league you do not even want to look here 

Recording: (5038/ 8002)

which wasthe purpose of his book i suppose 

Recording: (5047/ 8002)

Recording: (5048/ 8002) 
and um so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church tacked on and we they asked the choir for input 

Recording: (5049/ 8002) 
yeah it is it is a change of pace and plus being around my sister instead of you know taking a twenty mile lag all the way out there just go a couple blocks over and there she is 

Recording: (5050/ 8002)

Recording: (5117/ 8002) 
so they are close but i try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who is a a nice charitable human being the others are all nice and sweet and stuff but do not have enough rewarding characteristics to make me want to spend lots of time around them 

Recording: (5118/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5119/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (5120/ 8002) 
yeah i think it is further east than where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it is like the border of europe and asia 

Recording: (5121/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5122/ 8002) 
mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh library of congress has it i will just drive out to washington or have them send it here you know um that i think is a major contribution of the past generation uh 

Recording: (5123/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (5124/ 8002) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well the you know does i mean uh it is seems you know from what i have read it if you wanted to make a bomb it is fairly uncomplicated you know so that is 

Recording: (5125/ 8002) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (5126/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5127/ 8002) 
yeah it does it is not like a skilled profession to me i think 

Recording: (5128/ 8002) 
that is right in other words there is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5129/ 8002) 
well see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like the the europeans do i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they got the trains that the eurotrains and the buses and and and and just like the by just by personal car you can go you know across just go across the border you can then go and visit uh you know countries like like it is so condensed but here it is like we have got our oceans and it is like we gotta like fly so so i i think that is why like i think the europeans are more are much more cooler in that respect rather than much more cosmopolitan just because it they they they it is like it is no big deal for for like somebody in europe to speak like seven languages where here it is like you know you get somebody over here who who can actually who actually knows english <LAUGH> you know it is like so that that is i think that is i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5130/ 8002) 
and i would definitely keep a eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (5131/ 8002) 
i got one sister 

Recording: (5132/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (5133/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5134/ 8002) 
for the concert on the river we do not tend to take her to things like the art festival or the it is just too crowded 

Recording: (5135/ 8002) 
i have seen more people violent on liquor like said i worked in bars and i am 

Recording: (5136/ 8002) 
it i just i can not believe there is that many people that need the service all the time 

Recording: (5137/ 8002) 
umhum uh well my oldest one this is really odd because uh the school she goes to it is sort of like uh thrift store chic and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said you know we are not in the poor house you are not buying clothes in the thrift store so she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh you know because she just looks like a bum i think and you know when it was time for like a um a a dance or something she would go out and buy a dress you know at penny is or someplace at the mall you know and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home i would go what did they say you know about your dress and she goes jalena is that you and i go see you clean up really nice i said you know you have the best shape you are ever gone have in your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants i said you know when you get when you get in your fifties and you have got a gut and a big ass YKNOW you could do that 

Recording: (5138/ 8002) 
but we go out and look uh we look do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the the uh secular world 

Recording: (5139/ 8002) 
i am working here uh um but working um work study 

Recording: (5140/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5141/ 8002) 
he is 

Recording: (5142/ 8002) 
and uh that is when i lost my job after that and things got difficult more and more difficult um was unable to work full time i am doing some part time work right now working with people with mental illness um but it is you know the the thing i am running into out there is that uh nobody wants to pay you to do anything <LAUGH> uh i do not understand that but uh and then the when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you you know they give you a pager a cell phone and they want to know where you are morning noon and night seven days a week and that is none of their business um so i the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and and how i operate and will give me freedom to do what i can do i have a bachelor of arts in communications but it is been more of a problem than it is been a asset um interviewing for jobs people that uh were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and uh they are not gonna hire me when after a year i would be their boss <LAUGH> um so a lot of that is out there uh regardless of what people say i am not trying to be pessimistic or negative it is just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i have not been ever uh told that my degree matters by any employer uh contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree uh you know uh people told me soon as i got out of college then i needed a masters and then they said and after you get your masters you will definitely need your doctorate well you know the people saying this are college people the college is a business uh and it takes awhile to REALIZE THAT if you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships that is that is good but then even now being a person with a somewhat disability from a brain injury um i mean i do not even like to call it disability and i have uh different abilities now you know same abilities i used to do but i have to do them a different way um just because my brain functions on a different level and i can not explain that to anybody and i should not have to but i am always forced to um but uh trying to find a job you know uh resulting from this has been difficult and uh and that is uh you know i am not giving up hope or nothing like that i am just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh you know there is just ah um um it is very limited out there you know and your education is is an asset but like i said even as a person uh now going through b v r um i am discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelors in other words uh bureau of vocational rehabilitation which is government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and um because i already have a bachelors they will not pay for school now if i were stupid you know if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and did not even have my g e d boy they would pay for my high school my college and everything you know even living expenses you know but because i have a bachelors nothing you know 

Recording: (5143/ 8002)

Recording: (5144/ 8002) 
um it is probably would be worse i mean actually just wait for my last experiments i heard couple people talking about it they were talking about it

<LAUGH> how would you do this to ME <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5148/ 8002) 
right they and that is it they had not had a challenge you need to have challenges put to you everyday everyday you have more meaningfulness in life so that when you put your head down at night you are saying oh i am thankful for what i did <LAUGH> gosh darn it i am still coming to you i need more help tomorrow because <LAUGH> without something intangible there is gonna be a motivation factor someone is gotta give you a drill and to get up tomorrow morning and say hey i am gonna do a better job today than i did yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he is struggled yesterday well let us lower this thing bar let us lower the bar a little more let us lower you know gosh darn it hey scooney you did not make that last shot last night hey hey time out let us give scooney two more minutes to make let us let him have another shoot he gets two more minutes to try to get it

not at this job no 

Recording: (5151/ 8002) 
i do not know uh in i do not uh for a while we got it stopped the thing that is uh confusing to me is that sometimes we will get something stopped for twenty five or thirty years or ten or fifteen and then we go back it is like hey we got moved ourselves out of that why are we going back to it now um and and i think you know the papers keep saying that our uh crime rate is going down and everything and so uh i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people the who are ill or are sick and try to help them with their you you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is a disease okay and uh so now we try to help alcoholics well well certainly MURDERING IS A <LAUGH>

cause any harm but 

Recording: (5197/ 8002) 
i know i am <LAUGH> i can not wait because i the house we live in it is a half double with we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but you know i have like eighty plants my house now but i just can not wait to have my own space i never plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i am going to leave you know 

Recording: (5198/ 8002) 
um i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is it is like a it is a foot in the door if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and 

Recording: (5199/ 8002) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (5200/ 8002) 
because it is more open um and you couch it in terms of civil rights um my boyfriend is thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against uh he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based and that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different um whatever those eye pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that is just cosmetic and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation that is cosmetic too uh and again my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine um so i do not know that anyone could change it what was your question again 

Recording: (5201/ 8002)

umhum 

Recording: (5213/ 8002) 
uh like i know one of the poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it is meant to kill a rat obviously seems pretty dangerous 

Recording: (5214/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (5215/ 8002) 
there did not used to be and especially in restaurants and everything and now it is such an open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um body is taste you know i mean before no i would have to go in to a restaurant and salad and baked potato you know i mean there was nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the food is so cooked down i mean honestly you know it is like no nutritional value 

Recording: (5216/ 8002) 
once you are in it you are been in it and that is it i have thirty two points 

Recording: (5217/ 8002) 
yeah it is uh well you are right

Recording: (5219/ 8002) 
uh we have been very happy with the o s u daycare i do not know if you have any association with but oh it is it is just unbelievable our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade and uh i mean when she got out of that daycare she could read she could write she could do computer you know you know it is an education it is not you know people you pay for it is one of your highers but you know higher amount of money for

so you have how many kids 

Recording: (5221/ 8002) 
that is true home

Recording: (5223/ 8002)

Recording: (5224/ 8002) 
um i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean THERES NO MORE sinister group than the other that i know 

Recording: (5225/ 8002) 
yeah think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area um i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know i am more aware of what is going on and i really um gonna be some kind of activist for <LAUGH> um i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things like that i just i think that is gonna be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there is one off of uh bethel or no it is off of henderson cahoots and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i could not even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so thinking it really affects it yeah try to go around <LAUGH> YEAH and until they make a women is uh club SO will not be real EQUAL <LAUGH> YEAH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5226/ 8002)

Recording: (5231/ 8002) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the libraries connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got p c is on their desk and suddenly the whole world of who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out in the public work in the public scene do it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the web you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just can wants to connect to us 

Recording: (5232/ 8002)

Recording: (5287/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5288/ 8002) 
i mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5289/ 8002) 
crime and stuff i i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over um but people have been better off financially overall uh and i and i do not think he is made anybody i do not i would not say he is made any major mistakes policy wise well yes the his personal life <LAUGH> he is well yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5290/ 8002)

Recording: (5293/ 8002) 
well back then i was working at a cycle shop but i was in the service but i was working there 

Recording: (5294/ 8002) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help kids because a lot times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5295/ 8002) 
yeah oh my uh <LAUGH> i am in this uh venturing crew which is through boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (5296/ 8002)

Recording: (5302/ 8002)

Recording: (5303/ 8002) 
and i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (5304/ 8002) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school <LAUGH> because there were pregnant GIRLS IN my high school 

Recording: (5305/ 8002) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (5306/ 8002) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (5307/ 8002) 
and i think that sometimes they do not even count all the votes or something and sometimes that they want it to go through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen that somehow or other they will count it so it did or they will well you know 

Recording: (5308/ 8002) 
the part of it no its takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching 

Recording: (5309/ 8002)

Recording: (5313/ 8002) 
how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea in to somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry these those things out i think it is it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (5314/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5315/ 8002)

Recording: (5352/ 8002) 
yeah <LAUGH> yeah and that is the thing about schools too you know i totally disagree with uniforms you know unless it is all slacks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms and they are short and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said hey you know hey this uh you know have not met me and i and i really you know fault myself for that but it is made me more aware too and i you know when you look at someone and you say oh you would never dream that they well i do you know there is not anything i do not put past anybody doing i really do not cause they just yeah oh <LAUGH> <laugh=no> no no i do because there is some good ones out there there is some bad ones too but you know 

Recording: (5353/ 8002) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (5354/ 8002) 
but i mean i honestly do think i would at least go to church on occasion if it was not forced on me i mean it just got sort of just to the point of being RIDICULOUS going seventeen eighteen years every single week 

Recording: (5355/ 8002) 
ah 

Recording: (5356/ 8002) 
um three years 

Recording: (5357/ 8002) 
oh wow 

Recording: (5358/ 8002) 
you can get in huge arguments people like no you are lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them dead and honestly i can honestly say i would not want that to happen to them 

Recording: (5359/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5360/ 8002) 
um <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5361/ 8002)

Recording: (5362/ 8002) 
no no they take no they take the money whether you are in it or not you have no choice you have a choice as to whether you are a member or not but they still take the money and if you cross the line they will take that money back so anybody that yeah you know you are better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time i did some of that INTERVIEWING it is tough to you know columbus has a big you know job market there is everywhere you look there is help wanted so but it is tough to get a job where you can just walk in and start today or you know tell him hey you know the minute strike is over i am gone and so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job so oh yeah three weeks of pay it is cost yeah cost quite a bit of money but if you got some strike pay and this and that but it was not a lot you know two hundred dollars a week is not much at all so and when you have a FAMILY and i mean two hundred dollars a week do not pay my day care bill so so it is gonna be tight for our family for a few months you know to get back on 

Recording: (5363/ 8002) 
yeah you really do yeah 

Recording: (5364/ 8002) 
and they stopped doing that now 

Recording: (5365/ 8002)

Recording: (5452/ 8002) 
of the times and memories and stuff 

Recording: (5453/ 8002) 
there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it 

Recording: (5454/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (5460/ 8002) 
short north it is in the short north but um it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird um you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you go to axis you do not get hit on by girls you get hit on by guys i danced with glow sticks and i have had i had like seven guys come up to me in one night and they are just like can can you like can you do that for me 

Recording: (5461/ 8002) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not the welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (5462/ 8002) 
we hear um and now that is the most newsworthy story out there so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it the media 

Recording: (5463/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (5464/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5465/ 8002) 
so <LAUGH> i am like 

Recording: (5466/ 8002) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (5467/ 8002) 
like cathol=catholicism oh from mormons well our basic um real fundamental belief is that the church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve apostles and and but the after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those apostles and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it is still lasted all the same catholic and all the orthodox churches still carry all these beliefs 

Recording: (5468/ 8002) 
hit the mark sometimes so <LAUGH> HE GETS TO CLEAN THE TOILET especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (5469/ 8002) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (5470/ 8002) 
um no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5471/ 8002) 
yeah not not for special conditions NOTHING just universally it is wrong 

Recording: (5472/ 8002) 
because yeah 

Recording: (5473/ 8002) 
oh my gosh they just 

Recording: (5474/ 8002)

yeah he is really good 

Recording: (5478/ 8002) 
oh i know it is so much fun 

Recording: (5479/ 8002) 
yeah you have you follow the script it that that is real funny too like you know you get um they they listen to you like they monitor the calls and um you know they listen to you and then it is like this sheet like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know said it in this way and like if you used this or whatever you know and like um um oh it is just real weird 

Recording: (5480/ 8002) 
yeah when i first went to oberlin i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i would maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science um it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5481/ 8002) 
gay people or straight people so 

Recording: (5482/ 8002) 
it is just like your people you see go to church that walk out of church see somebody sitting there that is homeless 

Recording: (5483/ 8002) 
aw 

Recording: (5484/ 8002) 
and until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the uh it is always gonna be inequitable and you are gonna have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the developers are thinking well let us see well we can make condos downsize a little bit but still we want make this we want make this margin of profit yeah we do but what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (5485/ 8002) 
yeah it is but see i have always i i have one floors where i live now i vacuum them i mean i am just the type you know i did not want pet hair and 

Recording: (5486/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5487/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5488/ 8002) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy 

Recording: (5489/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5490/ 8002) 
no this real like to live off campus you have to well after my class it will be twenty two and senior credit status but my class was twenty one or senior or senior credit so i got to move off campus but like had i been a year younger i would not have been able to because they have to wait until twenty two so they are 

Recording: (5491/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5492/ 8002) 
names i uh actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she liked so they brought her um lunch in to her and the nurse jokingly said or the aid or something why do not you just pick couple of names off the menu so she named them lemonjello and orangello lemon jello orange jello she picked lemon jello orange jello and turned them into lemonjello and orangello <LAUGH> denise and denephew <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5493/ 8002) 
i do not argue with em i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (5494/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (5495/ 8002) 
and uh well she the uh the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community um in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (5496/ 8002) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about <laugh=things> my oldest sister you know i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5497/ 8002) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets them the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to the daycare and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (5498/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5499/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> YEAH right yeah 

Recording: (5500/ 8002) 
person on she is pretty high up i guess i was unaware 

Recording: (5501/ 8002) 
i answered it RIGHT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5502/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5503/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5504/ 8002) 
but managed get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and chris chris is interpretation of the story at this point is one moment i am cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment i i turn around there is a large police OFFICER IH=IN DOORWAY of your room he said hi <LAUGH> he said i think you should come downstairs they do not tell chris anything so chris comes downstairs and he stands beside me 

Recording: (5505/ 8002) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is not insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is not insane and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and um <LAUGH> um so i got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh reincarnation and the law of cause and effect and if a person murders somebody they need they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their um their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (5506/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5507/ 8002) 
makes and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (5508/ 8002) 
they are like three times more price wise but 

Recording: (5509/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5510/ 8002) 
do not say oh well your son is gonna be gay he is two right now let us you know change this so it so it does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (5511/ 8002) 
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it 

Recording: (5512/ 8002) 
to get them thinking about it then they will start to notice it in their life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (5513/ 8002) 
yeah we yup you have to concentrate on what is important or it just flies by and you do not even see it yeah 

Recording: (5514/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5515/ 8002) 
and uh the other one is um a uh working cuff at the steubenville ohio uh 

Recording: (5516/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5517/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5518/ 8002) 
uh we were floating around just they did not know if they were gonna send us in or not because it was toward the end of it 

Recording: (5519/ 8002)

Recording: (5520/ 8002) 
they are liking it you know small town living out in the country raising the kids you know their big house huge yard dog you know i we keep looking and saying you know now how is this different or better for the kids so 

Recording: (5521/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5522/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (5523/ 8002) 
well uh yeah i think it is real important to really good uh get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because because there is always gonna be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel <noisegood> about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people their you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then it you know i think it is kind of <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5524/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5525/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5526/ 8002) 
uh you know he is paying rent at his mother in law as was not not really his mother in law but in her so she can right uh he is he has become more responsible but responsible about a lot of things which is again at normal maturation and he is just doing it the hard way 

Recording: (5527/ 8002) 
you know he had he had 

Recording: (5528/ 8002) 
yeah yeah my best friend lives in on outside canberra and she has a lot of medical problems but huh 

Recording: (5529/ 8002) 
that that is what is making the these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (5530/ 8002) 
the rail service no 

Recording: (5531/ 8002) 
with that boy 

Recording: (5532/ 8002) 
then you have a choice there you would not necessarily uh have you should have had more self control and not had the child do not expect me to pay for your uh lack of uh will power that is that is a selfish attitude that is stealing as well 

Recording: (5533/ 8002) 
i have to admit when we go to try play golf sometimes and not have a tee time you can not even get in 

Recording: (5534/ 8002) 
yeah like a lot of people like i do not i do not know why a lot of people go but like with a a lot of people i know it is like go to hear really good MUSIC and like it is amazing like what happens you know like people together and like people dancing together you look out and everybody is dancing you know and like music is really good and everybody is really into it and working 

Recording: (5535/ 8002) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (5536/ 8002) 
i was about to say now on the record or off the 

Recording: (5537/ 8002) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that a you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (5538/ 8002) 
right same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else have had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situations got that way but i do feel that the older people including our government people and everybody that is at the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (5539/ 8002) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5540/ 8002) 
oxleys is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5541/ 8002) 
OH OKAY <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5542/ 8002) 
which was scheduled in the evenings i when was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5543/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5544/ 8002) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (5545/ 8002) 
because you know the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and you know at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it is not game game it is it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (5546/ 8002) 
it it was not easy and at first it was probably a lot harder then after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to coming back here was 

Recording: (5547/ 8002) 
oh uhhuh 

Recording: (5548/ 8002) 
now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to i think that the you said get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth i that is that is the family but uh i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values uh but but but good values i whether they are old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but the i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and that will help them permeate the entire society and but it is got to start back here in the first and i think 

Recording: (5549/ 8002) 
i think that uh yeah it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5550/ 8002) 
at our desks we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (5551/ 8002) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5552/ 8002) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again that is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bartender responsible but say you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5553/ 8002) 
SURE <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5554/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5555/ 8002) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (5556/ 8002) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we would better not you know 

Recording: (5557/ 8002) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education they have 

Recording: (5558/ 8002) 
well number one it is a little bit smaller more controlled area <LAUGH> quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to the sister you know my sister lives up there she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having all the peace and <LAUGH> peace and quiet she you know plus in a place that is only year old 

Recording: (5559/ 8002) 
uh we are planning on moving in the spring 

Recording: (5560/ 8002) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5561/ 8002) 
they go she is got it and they go on to the next guy and then all a sudden you are going off this way and they go uh six nine juliet uh where are you going and you are like uh i uh told me to and then they go oh brother you know so now you know the attention is diverted to you so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there are really professional yeah umhum 

Recording: (5562/ 8002) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5563/ 8002) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on you okay i i just have a question is do you is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5564/ 8002) 
my boyfriend would love to mess with this i just want you to know that he would be like taking it apart putting it back together

um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know the sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have lots of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying oh you know he had you know slept with like ten girls or something and i am thinking oh my gosh you know and he is thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not of working age they get like a an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they are provided they are the top of the list for a council house so they get their own there was actually a long documentary on before i left um you know of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents and you know her parents were at the end of their rope she got pregnant and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know what more could she want you know was basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do whatever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they are almost rewarded for you know

Recording: (5630/ 8002) 
yeah i i you know i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter ALMOST every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable of or what they can do because if they are really verbal and my kids always have been really verbal because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even you know when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole obviously see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give it food and water and when it died it i was so surprised that she had not given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because but i mean now that was bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things or i would i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly

YEAH <LAUGH> so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty i q for example and you know he is not gonna get all the details and the battles and the years and the captain is names but you just want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time uh in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted just the main concepts well there is the kid that you say todd you study for the test and when you come in i will let you answer anything on the test you know and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (5726/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (5727/ 8002) 
i 

Recording: (5728/ 8002) 
yeah i mean but i mean we are not at a depression and and the you know the employment rate is fine and healthcare is we have got some improvements there and like i said that that student loan <LAUGH> you know uh but i just i mean so i would not say he is done a a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we have wasted but we could have spent that money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5729/ 8002) 
and she goes well after i read the book i asked them a lot of questions so maybe they did not give it to YOU <LAUGH> you know like how we do not wanna go through this again because she is a little OLDER THAN ME i thought that was hilarious

yeah i do not do a whole lot of it but i like to travel 

Recording: (5731/ 8002) 
then his parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyed my husband said i would have let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i want her to come home the other well the bottom line it was hysterical because she and this little boy they are outside and he they are jumping and he is jumping on the trampoline i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say you know honey i said really sorry about the plans but i just you could not i just could not let you her stay there that long he goes oh that is okay my mom would never let me do that so and i am thinking you know here is everybody is acting like i am the bad guy and i am i am the one who is into right and so there i just wanna tell you one more thing that was funny because um there was something she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i would not let her skip because it was for a party that her friends were having and i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you you keep your commitments and so was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case she goes so what is with him he never has an opinion how come all of a sudden he is allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do you know it was really funny we laughed about it and i let her um i let her skip IT <LAUGH> because i decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5732/ 8002)

Recording: (5735/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5736/ 8002) 
um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever um just because obviously you basically mimic your parents as far as what you do when you are young and things like that and obviously IF YOU SO had two male parents or whatever obviously you might be thinking <LAUGH> more towards like dating guys and things like that um i do not know if that would be really a problem though i mean i do not know if that would honestly happen 

Recording: (5737/ 8002) 
yeah i mean i do not see any particular reason for her to wear the spandex except for to appeal to a uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which i think it does <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5738/ 8002) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had not missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (5739/ 8002)

um 

Recording: (5746/ 8002) 
our dorms were cleaner 

Recording: (5747/ 8002) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is the driving force of our of our of our government and and even like cause without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations the you could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they have become fairly powerful but i do not think that is necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that supported supported the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you do not necessarily need a union 

Recording: (5748/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (5749/ 8002) 
i sort of wore out um that and um just oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting exhausted and uh it was just so demanding and we did not know as a community how to let uh up SO I HAD TO <LAUGH> HAD TO i had to withdraw another thing was i am very into um metaphysics and studying and meditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was in there um that is one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there is always people coming for four or five days and you have TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN LIFE TO THEM IN FOUR OR FIVE DAYS and plus we uh lived in um a a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant and a hardware and had a mail route and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we uh made our own bread and we uh milked a cow AND UH <LAUGH> so it is just plain hard physical work plus all the mental um stuff of dealing with people is really big questions it it was INTENSE <LAUGH> you know so that is the reason i had to quit is was like if i could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself i would have been okay but that was not how it worked so had to to pull back from it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5750/ 8002)

Recording: (5788/ 8002) 
THE <LAUGH> particularly huh 

Recording: (5789/ 8002) 
those are the formative years of a child 

Recording: (5790/ 8002) 
is is that why people go snorkeling 

Recording: (5791/ 8002) 
everybody is coastal but us 

Recording: (5792/ 8002) 
but but was if that if that but if that p h d was given to you if they lowered the standards if they lowered the standards for you to get into graduate school it would not that be challenging for you hey great they lowered it for me my sister did not have oh she had a rough time getting in but now i can get in anywhere i got a lower 

Recording: (5793/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5794/ 8002) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point there <LAUGH> BUT he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had uh uh various people within his community or whether whether you are talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then slowly then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of today and i will leave out this the last two years it because it is because it is rather specific right now but uh going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i am seeing it even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there uh hey come on we will go to dinner we will go do this and we will do this and do this just uh just barely barely breaking uh the barrier but not breaking the law uh so yes very definitely progressively has changed 

Recording: (5795/ 8002) 
no the funniest thing though was with my husband and the CHILD because he is so he is so fair and he said in the hospital people were looking at him like there is no way that could happen <LAUGH> he said that because you know they take them off to weigh weigh him or whatever and i said you do not leave him he said people were looking at him like 

Recording: (5796/ 8002) 
and they never were i mean the same with like in france especially oh mcdonalds well mcdonalds was full of all the french people you know i mean 

Recording: (5797/ 8002) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something it will give them a little bit of hope if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but uh for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean now that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that cut and dried um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (5798/ 8002) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes to his aunt amy is you know it is bye mom you know <LAUGH> look up okay bye <LAUGH> that is it 

Recording: (5799/ 8002) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (5800/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5801/ 8002) 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but no i am i am very happy and content with her decision yeah very much so in as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsan she and her husband both baptists they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it is a yes it is it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (5802/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5803/ 8002) 
why would you wanna leave you said you are a third world country why would you wanna be to table to i would been i would not this this country has a lot of problems it is just like my family has a lot of problems why would i leave the family why would i leave the country why not work with it and correct it cause when i run away from it you know what i am doing i am running into another chaos at the other end someone else coming the other direction and they have not resolved things and that is been happening our society we have not sit down to learn and understand one another f 

Recording: (5804/ 8002)

but he is also like i said he is got five kids they live in low income housing they are collecting welfare 

Recording: (5806/ 8002) 
well they are now in a sense uh it is easier to to go somewhere else i think on the web on tv if you have you know like four news four local news channels and they are all saying the same thing and emphasizing the same things there is no choice there if you want the news you are gonna get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else uh and you know major newspapers are all over the web uh you can pick and choose and you can see different perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a a wider view yeah 

Recording: (5807/ 8002) 
years ago there was a i do not know if you were what your background is where you were here but or not but citizen journal was a daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the dispatch was much more liberal they used this and it it was a morning paper and the dispatch is an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same printing presses and everything and then dispatch when their lease expired would not renew their lease 

Recording: (5808/ 8002) 
umhum yep 

Recording: (5809/ 8002)

Recording: (5813/ 8002) 
um well i found that that i mean everyone has people from outside the united states have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone those stereotypes dissipate um i mean i actually had a conversation very similar to this the other night with a couple of germans that i met at a coffee house um i mean the the stereotype that most americans have of germans are those of bavarians uh and not real bavarians but stereotypical bavarians uh beer drinking bratwurst eating sauerkraut eating lederhosen wearing uh you know 

Recording: (5814/ 8002) 
things get away from it all yeah yeah so um i came down here because he knew where my parents lived and plus columbus was a lot more opportunity 

Recording: (5815/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5816/ 8002) 
until i threatened to sue them 

Recording: (5817/ 8002) 
i i do not think anyone really affected anyone too much as far as that goes 

Recording: (5818/ 8002) 
hum 

Recording: (5819/ 8002) 
right they look at more what you have to say then your clothes and that that was something i remember them talking about too you do not want them to look at what you are what you are wearing and that is mostly that was a good thing for the dress code just 

Recording: (5820/ 8002)

Recording: (5823/ 8002) 
i am very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it is because mom was home and you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it does not have to be mom i mean um you know mom can go work and dad can stay home there is nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad there everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they have had a really bad day and something is really bothering them they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it is like well how how is school okay 

Recording: (5824/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5825/ 8002) 
and there is like nothing in it and uh you know it is like go down the list that is what i do what do YOU he just thinks i automatically know i am a mind reader <LAUGH> that is what it is <LAUGH>

Recording: (5834/ 8002) 
i have been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women sometimes i felt kinda weird about it 

Recording: (5835/ 8002) 
because they done away with the uh civil service step raises which were wrong cause coulda done crummy job and got same raise as doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (5836/ 8002) 
umhum umhum so uh but it is a an adjustment to get back into it but but i i do like it up there better as far as uh possibilities of uh working closer to home and stuff and not having to worry to about a bus and

Recording: (5879/ 8002) 
yeah yeah ever authority figures at all you know she is she is really strong about that though because um she does not look at anybody being be uh you know maybe more wiser more experienced in things but you know certainly she does not trust anybody 

Recording: (5880/ 8002) 
tied up to a fence you know i think they deserve to die because with the prisons and the overcrowding that is a whole another subject you know that it is just amazing to me so many people are in there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (5881/ 8002) 
indirectly yes 

Recording: (5882/ 8002)

this will be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off if their cats are sick 

Recording: (5884/ 8002) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am gay i do not know if i am gay or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually 

Recording: (5885/ 8002) 
oh it is most of it is liberal and they have always find some way to misrepresent like uh kirwan 

Recording: (5886/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5887/ 8002) 
well that is probably the roof right there so 

Recording: (5888/ 8002) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no real religion and i would been going to presbyterian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something a church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i would never had that before <LAUGH> and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i had listened to eastern religions and i have listened to the jehovah is witnesses and and and then when i read in the book of mormon it is just i it is a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really felt at home with this and that is why i decided 

Recording: (5889/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5890/ 8002)

Recording: (5893/ 8002) 
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and could continue to operating systems word um the goal of learning operating systems is real simple if you are playing with computer and you screw something up the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over 

Recording: (5894/ 8002) 
uh no that is why i wanna do the hiking things i am like ready i can get a like a visa because i somebody told me wow you know you go some some places in europe you might have some problems getting a tourist visa because sometimes they work illegal

you know they talk about drinking from the fountain now they are only gargling they are not drinking much by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they are pretty savvy these days they are not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do 

Recording: (5913/ 8002) 
well uh my youngest son married a catholic girl who was from a large catholic family and their kids are going to a catholic school 

Recording: (5914/ 8002)

Recording: (5919/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (5920/ 8002) 
you know it is a real worried and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh geezy are we doing the right thing you know but you know some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it and we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know they are all in daycare <LAUGH> they you know you know they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the daycare so 

Recording: (5921/ 8002) 
my husband lived in a town a small town in southern ohio where the dentists in town were three brothers and they were named pain pain and pain dentists and it was spelled p a i n there is some funny name stories out there boy but people just go nuts with their kids names i just like would you want to why would you do that to that kid carol harold <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5922/ 8002) 
oh yeah herb 

Recording: (5923/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5924/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5925/ 8002) 
gonna be a really busy day and i would the same thing at port columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i mentioned somebody i go where are the extra airplanes and they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just hafta put bigger airplanes on so he said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is holiday time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (5926/ 8002) 
and nobody is worth that you know so that is what i am saying it is so retarded uh over i do not mean to use that word in a bad way but it is ridiculous that is better word uh that that people have to uh uh have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can not afford the legal help so i think that is wrong in this country the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right you know it is land of the free all right yeah it is free country but it will cost you 

Recording: (5927/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5928/ 8002) 
and you know just sometimes it is just like they are like oh well she could not understand or something like that but for the most part i there is you know no weirdness he is had he had a few cousins you know make some little comments but 

Recording: (5929/ 8002) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (5930/ 8002) 
uh i was only there for couple weeks in the harbor i never set foot on land 

Recording: (5931/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5932/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5933/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (5934/ 8002) 
yeah and you know i would i would like to have another job but i would i would love i know you will say this is really stupid but i would love to have a monday through friday eight to five job never work another evening a saturday or a sunday if if it can be now i know i will probably not be able to do that because o s u wants me to come back there so as a contractor so i do not know you know 

Recording: (5935/ 8002) 
right right 

Recording: (5936/ 8002) 
oh did they 

Recording: (5937/ 8002) 
nailed over it instead of replacing the door so 

Recording: (5938/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5939/ 8002) 
it was columbus he went to uh fort hayes 

Recording: (5940/ 8002) 
uh about twelve 

Recording: (5941/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5942/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5943/ 8002) 
i am 

Recording: (5944/ 8002) 
you know they want to be judged as like everybody else but you know i think um they have so many different ideas and not that either one of them is right but still um i i think there is always going to barrier there they are just kids are just not all kids are going to get along you know i mean 

Recording: (5945/ 8002) 
yeah should been in class 

Recording: (5946/ 8002) 
oh lots of people travel all over i you know i mean that is i do not lots people do you know i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but i you know i i would do ten twelve a year 

Recording: (5947/ 8002) 
oh okay okay it is part of growing up and i i have been there done that too but still you have to you have to um know there is respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they saw the interaction with the elderly people the school he went to a lot of public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and their teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids i ask them i said do you guys ever go home said no oh yeah i said but they are always there they are not there just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are there after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock oh time to quit they are gone those people do not know meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i did not say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated not necessarily materialistically they will be then more than they are expected they will be recompensated somewhere but the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing well gee what is for what is in it for me what is in it for you is uh intangible are you willing 

Recording: (5948/ 8002) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brother in law is gay and when i met him i knew he was i you know he was the type some of them you can not tell well it does not matter what they look like um but my husband said all through growing up he liked men he did not like girls he looked at MAGAZINE you know all this stuff and i thought that is so funny because growing up i just did not know know anybody that was um but you know he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning and she was from germany which made it a little tough because you know they did not talk about those things over there at all for a long time but um then she became very open with him and every but everybody knew and that was in the eighties and you know if some kids know it when they are young and growing up you know i do not know if it is best to not say it or to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then than if they wait later on in their life you know but some of sometimes i guess they change you know most the men i knew right off the bat know i mean i mean it was it and it was all through their life it was not as though they just said oh i am i am going be gay 

Recording: (5949/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5950/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5951/ 8002) 
and so it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that willing to say i just can not make those uh he would let he would let my daughter who is he left left her at the movies one night they went to the movies there was no um the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not gonna start until nine thirty which means this kid is twelve years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve you know at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although this tomboy who is just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there and uh they said they called me but i i was running the sweeper so i did not hear the phone so left her there and he said that she was gonna call back you know at at a certain time and i was gonna tell her what she could or could not do so i said you know well you are gonna have to come home you know he is gonna have to come and get you oh come on no we are not gonna do that i you know you can not be this late so he went back down picked them and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (5952/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5953/ 8002) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be i normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (5954/ 8002) 
very different <LAUGH> uh just been a lot of innovations and 

Recording: (5955/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5956/ 8002) 
so i do not know just lucky <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5957/ 8002) 
umhum and then they end up okay anyway <LAUGH> that is good <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5958/ 8002) 
oh you have to nowadays you know i do not understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just does not happen now now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing forty hours a week too so it is it is work and it is a full time job they start shoot the seven year old just brought here it is the end of the year second grade she brings home this project gonna have to have a book report use three books of reference you know she is never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long you know getting this information out of her you know she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on it she gonna have to stand up in front of the class and make a box with a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems more like you know sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids you know i can not believe in second grade we were already writing cursive already that is all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of it yeah she is in fractions she is doing fractions she is doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one two <LAUGH> you know in second grade it just seems like they are three years ahead so 

Recording: (5959/ 8002) 
he found out he could just move yeah so you know he always got away from that 

Recording: (5960/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5961/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (5962/ 8002) 
YEAH <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> umhum 

Recording: (5963/ 8002) 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that that is had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i uh the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much profanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i gotta do my own thing that is where the when i want to do my own thing started he says with the women is feminist MOVEMENT <LAUGH> and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because after all so much speaking up and they want to do things my bing crosby who was it no um 

Recording: (5964/ 8002) 
you know you know what i mean 

Recording: (5965/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5966/ 8002) 
cause they are so stylish 

Recording: (5967/ 8002) 
yeah exactly and it is just it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (5968/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5969/ 8002) 
i said yep i said you caught mommy saying a bad word and you would have got soap in your mouth yep so i go in the bathroom now what i always always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and i just put a little bit of soap on the end of their tongue well now i have been i have had false teeth since i was about thirty two needless to say i had false teeth when this kid did THIS <LAUGH> AND SHE WAS ONLY ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD WORD WORD go in the bathroom i sit down on that toilet stool and i sit there i stick out my tongue she takes that cake of soap she does not rub my tongue she twists it it got on my teeth and it took me almost two weeks to get that soap taste off my teeth no matter how i scrubbed needless to say if i would begin to get impatient after that and i am ready to say something i am look AROUND TO SEE IF THERES 

Recording: (5970/ 8002) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like theysaid they came out and said thecatholic church was against it but at the same time like with the research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can notso much really condemn it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (5971/ 8002) 
hum um hum um 

Recording: (5972/ 8002) 
wow i am getting i am GETTING NERVOUS <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5973/ 8002) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged to him but i decide to 

Recording: (5974/ 8002) 
uh i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but um but it is not that i it is i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university 

Recording: (5975/ 8002) 
but we really ever really have not talked about that but my ex wife is got family here so uh you know she comes in about two or three weeks at least out of a summer 

Recording: (5976/ 8002) 
just you know 

Recording: (5977/ 8002) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (5978/ 8002) 
you know how far are they held responsible i do not know you would have to go on a case by case basis 

Recording: (5979/ 8002) 
WOW 

Recording: (5980/ 8002) 
well yeah we got broke into uh i think twice and stuff got stolen my trucks been broken into my moms cars been broken into the gas siphoned pretty much everybody around there is been uh criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (5981/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5982/ 8002) 
you know so if it is kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then i do not need it 

Recording: (5983/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5984/ 8002) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5985/ 8002) 
i have never heard of it being developed commercially 

Recording: (5986/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> he is saw he is seen my oldest son when he was like two i was at my cousin is wedding my cousin invited me to his wedding and me and my son went that was before me and my husband got married that is another long story he was three when we got married <LAUGH> and um my my dad threw fit 

Recording: (5987/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (5988/ 8002) 
oh is that right <LAUGH> 

Recording: (5989/ 8002) 
oh no no they move you around all the time when you when you teach kids with learning disabilities they move you to where the population is rather than move the kids to you so yeah i have been in columbus and worthington are the two systems i have been in but no though within those systems they can move you around from school to school i have been at the same one now for this is my seventh year at the middle school 

Recording: (5990/ 8002) 
yes but that is great though 

Recording: (5991/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (5992/ 8002) 
for about seventeen or eighteen years and just reached the point where i would had enough of it and i mean i did not want anything about it 

Recording: (5993/ 8002) 
them little electric shock things 

Recording: (5994/ 8002) 
it is a lot of the it is looks a look and feel is a lot a lot the same 

Recording: (5995/ 8002) 
it is san is is it kind of like like a like a like 

Recording: (5996/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (5997/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (5998/ 8002) 
and now now it is now you 

Recording: (5999/ 8002) 
and uh these kids that are violent your whole society is violent i got okay i just got done helping my sister in law that is an example right there she is got five kids she is on welfare her husband is is arab right 

Recording: (6000/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6001/ 8002) 
that is okay VIA VIA INDIANNA 

Recording: (6002/ 8002) 
just because it is been three weeks now you know and not only that there is uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss 

Recording: (6003/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6004/ 8002) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (6005/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (6006/ 8002) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age too 

Recording: (6007/ 8002) 
oh was HORRIBLE IT WAS A HORRIBLE because you watch it and you think uh oh my god 

Recording: (6008/ 8002) 
i do not have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like yeah you should get out before you actually fail the class <LAUGH> and um it was it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that is what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just um that is uh unwise in in whether or not it was worth while and i believe that it is uh horribly worth while now and yet now i am not taking classes so 

Recording: (6009/ 8002) 
right umhum 

Recording: (6010/ 8002) 
umhum it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is a it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want TO BELIEVE you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (6011/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (6012/ 8002) 
yeah that blocks out all that uh extraneous stuff that is trying to pull you away 

Recording: (6013/ 8002) 
at each other is throat for this that and the other and and you know devon is uh my daughter is the one that really got put in the middle of it you know and probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could have been more uh problems legal problems you know as far as uh going back and forth to court and putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff you know and so uh in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 

Recording: (6014/ 8002) 
that you really did not need because then you could get more bang for your bucks 

Recording: (6015/ 8002) 
that is good no not really actually some i have and then i have run into the people that just like anything they wanna get out of their hometown they do not like it they complain but normally i find that those people are not taking advantage of the you know free art shows and you know i mean the things that are free i am like oh have you done this no i did not even know about it and you have lived here all your life and i have only lived here x number of years and 

Recording: (6016/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6017/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6018/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (6019/ 8002) 
yeah no problem 

Recording: (6020/ 8002) 
which is <LAUGH> well yeah you know could have done that too <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6021/ 8002) 
it is going be law it ai not going come and get my story so that means if you are working with me 

Recording: (6022/ 8002) 
and my youngest daughter when i was crabbing about it because i said i talked to them and they said well we are coming to ohio in a couple weeks and i said oh good are you gonna come and see us um well no we were not we were not planning on it and i said well why well we are we are not driving uh doty is renting us the car well all that meant was my sister was renting the car but he was driving the car yeah i said well well well then how are you gonna get to these other places and normally i would not do that i would just let it go well uh uh uh doty is renting that car and i said well are you are not you driving it well well yeah but and i said fine and i do not wanna even think about it so it is kind of like 

Recording: (6023/ 8002) 
he is like this robot 

Recording: (6024/ 8002) 
i was very naive on that i mean i mean you see it on the news and you but the actual relationships and all uh but again do you need to know that unless it pertains to you and then even if it does pertain to you 

Recording: (6025/ 8002) 
yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6026/ 8002) 
yeah oh yeah the five year old just after her the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know

Recording: (6042/ 8002) 
um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but

Recording: (6047/ 8002) 
yeah i am at the end of it all 

Recording: (6048/ 8002) 
right and well and there is nothing wrong with that 

Recording: (6049/ 8002)

Recording: (6054/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6055/ 8002)

Recording: (6061/ 8002)

Recording: (6062/ 8002) 
oh do they really 

Recording: (6063/ 8002) 
thirty on it and his report card he is got like a one point two five average so they take jalena who has an a him who has a d and they go well gee the average kid in the school is like c plus and they are stupid at this school columbus public schools do not do any good then you go to dublin worthington westerville in order to get there you you are not gonna be in his condition and you are not gonna be stupid because you are trying to you know you probably both husband and wife work so the intelligence is there and you are not gonna have dumb people living and going to those schools because it is very expensive live in that area so there is a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid and worthington dublin and it is really not true it is just that you know you can not tell all the poor people and the people that do not have two parents do not come to school because we want our scores higher but you know when the and when the news media goes look how bad brown school did this year but they do not look to see like jalena they do not go well look at the uh scores on the california achievement tests there is like seventy five percent the kids that are getting like you know nineties and above but twenty five percent are getting f is and d is 

Recording: (6064/ 8002) 
um he is probably been married for four or five years 

Recording: (6065/ 8002) 
which i she said that and i said 

Recording: (6066/ 8002) 
umhum hum 

Recording: (6067/ 8002) 
i had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted know what i did for a living and when i told them they said well we are done <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6068/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> i am guessing 

Recording: (6069/ 8002) 
oh <LAUGH> i know what did it mean well it is you instead of going to your classroom you go into a room where you have you sit and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can not talk or anything 

Recording: (6070/ 8002) 
did not hear about that 

Recording: (6071/ 8002) 
same 

Recording: (6072/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> he always has 

Recording: (6073/ 8002) 
oh gosh i hate that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (6074/ 8002) 
they set different roles up fine give me two more minutes to play 

Recording: (6075/ 8002) 
and work later then which was fine by me or he would call and he would say is it okay if i work a little late would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that 

Recording: (6076/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6077/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6078/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6079/ 8002) 
um do you know um a group called um midnight oil yeah <LAUGH> they are pretty good i like them yeah 

Recording: (6080/ 8002) 
but with kids and they are just so much more active at a early age 

Recording: (6081/ 8002) 
um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any healthcare and that is not right there is like there is a lot of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle middle middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that uh but that economy is coming along too and i mean it it will be it is developing itself which is which is nice i took a tour of a plant down there cause my my old my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day but they get they get bused into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because there like like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about the our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (6082/ 8002) 
umhum i do not know that they would use the INFORMATION if they had it <LAUGH> <LAUGH> i i do not know 

Recording: (6083/ 8002) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are gonna have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (6084/ 8002) 
you are grounded oh yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6085/ 8002) 
and they fly checks like if you write a check today and you deposit at the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearinghouse and that is all they do all night long 

Recording: (6086/ 8002) 
oh yeah and you know what i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook red meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups a lot of good soups for him with meat and it really does not bother me to cook it you know i am not go sit home make a roast every night 

Recording: (6087/ 8002) 
that is that is her job is to spoil them so the poor things have like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground YEP <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6088/ 8002) 
a little geography would not hurt 

Recording: (6089/ 8002) 
yeah so basically i learned with him YELLING AT ME i heard do this do that 

Recording: (6090/ 8002) 
no that is fine 

Recording: (6091/ 8002) 
i know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6092/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6093/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6094/ 8002) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (6095/ 8002) 
that would probably change my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6096/ 8002) 
teachers couple teachers take a bunch a kid every couple years they go to a different country 

Recording: (6097/ 8002) 
um <LAUGH> actually it is more it is almost actually turned into like a self business um like i said it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doing i would tell them they would be like oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and so i would go there and they would tell people and 

Recording: (6098/ 8002) 
itmightbe 

Recording: (6099/ 8002) 
no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate 

Recording: (6100/ 8002) 
oh well that is unfortunate <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6101/ 8002) 
i think um the people who have already graduated they are like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids want to go it it is just thought of as a somewhat party school 

Recording: (6102/ 8002) 
yeah and and everybody is gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with so you know and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was a center for the football team as he grew up older you know uh he realized that he was not as big as important as he uh and he blew out his knee for a o u you know i went to i went to school with larry hunter who is the a basketball coach for uh o u now and uh and he had the same thing happen to him uh he had uh scholarship for o u and both of his knees are shot and everything but uh and he was a good ballplayer probably one best ones i ever seen and uh rivalled like a larry byrd you know back in that day and everything and uh but one heck of a nice guy you know never let it get to him 

Recording: (6103/ 8002) 
yeah and that like i do notknow that state is notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night 

Recording: (6104/ 8002) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they are little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are gonna have to go to college and this is like the only life they are gonna get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know i am gonna play in a rock band you know they all think they are gonna be rock stars and drummers and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this is my real life duh this is my one real life better not throw it away they waste time you know they lose stuff 

Recording: (6105/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6106/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6107/ 8002) 
i have already learned an immense amount looking at my eurail thing okay so belgium is uh 

Recording: (6108/ 8002) 
yeah she just likes to write stories and she is real creative that way 

Recording: (6109/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6110/ 8002) 
do not realize it 

Recording: (6111/ 8002) 
yeah that is right when you are that was your question are we gonna have doom we are gonna have a catastrophe we gonna get this thing turned around before we have yes uh i think we will uh but i do not think we are ready to turn around yet i think we are still well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four five times i uh it it is coming upon us so rapidly i strongly predict that in just twenty years and possibly ten each and every one of us in the world are gonna be interconnected with one another but once again its an impersonal uh inner connection i can i will be able to contact you when you are over in paris and i will be over in in ohio and out there on the farm and i am probably watching the geese swimming up and down the little lake and you are sitting over there in paris having a uh coffee something something yeah it DOES <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6112/ 8002) 
i do not i do not think so but 

Recording: (6113/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6114/ 8002) 
amazing 

Recording: (6115/ 8002) 
fastest sucker on those braces 

Recording: (6116/ 8002) 
i am from here columbus ohio yeah 

Recording: (6117/ 8002) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it then what we will probably ever know um you know they really have not checked into the background of the parents you know they are still what their beliefs were and everything uh and i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidentally where uh some kid shoots another kid you know and then the parents are are responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed uh then they killed themselves so we will never know from their endpoint why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you know uh from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him making him do it you know 

Recording: (6118/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (6119/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6120/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6121/ 8002) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (6122/ 8002) 
shit man so she drove me all the way out of that county to next county where the pancake place is so she went out of her way and out of her jurisdiction with this southern hospitality just to get me out of the weather 

Recording: (6123/ 8002) 
are you sure i 

Recording: (6124/ 8002) 
i did have a a part time job i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go full time and i just did not feel like i wanted to go full time so i was working as a receptionist and uh answering the phone doing some light filing just a variety of tasks office type tasks and i really liked it i liked the hours but i did not want to go eight hours compared to four so i left 

Recording: (6125/ 8002) 
um probably would have been about six years ago i would been in sixth or seventh grade 

Recording: (6126/ 8002) 
and i just can not imagine i had dogs and cats we did and i loved it and i just think kids need that and it is just a different kind of love i think you know they learn from it and 

Recording: (6127/ 8002) 
there we go 

Recording: (6128/ 8002) 
some of them transfer from up north and out east and indiana and just different walks of life you know

i uh his wife is a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information um that he works with well i think she maybe uh retired last year but she had taught columbus for twenty years or something like that and so i think his information is good but i guess <LAUGH> THE way HE handles things sometimes gets THROUGH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6131/ 8002) 
no <LAUGH> no i really do not i have done uh i have done a variety of uh different things and then also um just reading and and things uh since i have been off and i i wanted to go back to school i thought about that and i wanna do something with kids i almost thought of opening my own daycare center but then i did not know if i wanted to get into that and 

Recording: (6132/ 8002) 
and then back of our house about i do not know five hundred yards there is a manmade lake 

Recording: (6133/ 8002) 
product certain things but they they want everything to be the same they can not be they can not be the same it is just a natural thing but the thing is let them do what they can that is a god given talent what you have there okay nurse and how many refuse the nurse voluntarily when they have children why talking among you women folk why do you have well i do not want to you have the natural ability to give all the all the natural protein the immunization things all that maternal milk why can not you instead of getting off the shelf 

Recording: (6134/ 8002) 
that is the key THING 

Recording: (6135/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6136/ 8002) 
okay so how are you gonna help them when they are all over 

Recording: (6137/ 8002) 
i think it should be the parent is responsibility but i have no objection to them teaching it somewhat in the schools i guess 

Recording: (6138/ 8002) 
right <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6139/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6140/ 8002)

Recording: (6144/ 8002) 
yeah i was only nineteen well i was eighteen when i went in but 

Recording: (6145/ 8002) 
there is i i 

Recording: (6146/ 8002) 
WELL <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> yeah a little 

Recording: (6147/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6148/ 8002) 
it was just like that i am telling you it was and we would see you know they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch i i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (6149/ 8002) 
well i do not really like the uh i do not i really do not like that job but uh you know i like the people there but it is like uh way too busy i think 

Recording: (6150/ 8002) 
no i think we are only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i have known um from middle school and following them up and you know they just all go their different ways like the one girl i was friends with at world park i mean she was a grade lower than me but when that we seen each other in the halls like hey what is up and and we would talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that in high school i did not know anything i i know she was bad <LAUGH> and that was it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6151/ 8002) 
it was we had a little gallery um we were in clintonville for a a year or so and then we moved to grandview and it was just fine art we called it fine art crafts and it was handmaid stuff from local people and we had lot of jewelry and pottery and silk and paintings that kind stuff 

Recording: (6152/ 8002) 
you know he says that e equals m c squared i say it is e equals m c cubed because the the world is three dimensional it is not two dimensional uh two dimensional limits everything but you look at his theory of relativity all of our mathematical theorems physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (6153/ 8002) 
yeah i do too 

Recording: (6154/ 8002) 
exactly but i do there and there is the other side um they uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly you are giving up your children and and then something has to be done but but there is also there is also that uh i i mean i think that it is probably a legitimate fear that children children of that group are gonna you know gonna be homogenized out of out of their heritage but i do not know uh you know they are kids without parents <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6155/ 8002) 
because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict for a while 

Recording: (6156/ 8002) 
uh it is a high school trip uh she is in eleventh grade 

Recording: (6157/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6158/ 8002) 
well because you know 

Recording: (6159/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6160/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6161/ 8002) 
so went to and high school 

Recording: (6162/ 8002) 
oh i do not really THINK so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i do not i guess i do not i do not get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i do not yell and scream at them i mean realize they did not ask to have a learning disability i mean they and that they can not they are not some teachers think they are just being belligerent and that if they wanted to straighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they can not change their learning disability anymore than you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way it is like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jumble up what you say you say turn to page three ninety three or and they turn to three thirty nine in their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you would probably have a lot of empathy for them 

Recording: (6163/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6164/ 8002)

Recording: (6235/ 8002) 
umhum yeah yeah

but she is out there somewhere you know we do not have again we do not have clear evidence where she is and there were couple times where they where we thought we knew where samantha was uh and when there were all those clones of her uh i think that was in the second season or so um i think if if they were gonna end it they were gonna have to have like three episodes in a row that just were tieing up all these loose ends that they keep having i suspect they probably will not do that they will um leave things open ended for future tv movies or maybe another uh feature length movie uh 

Recording: (6245/ 8002) 
our kids upbringing her mother was a cousin of uh james thurber 

Recording: (6246/ 8002)

Recording: (6253/ 8002) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about yeah and then what is to prevent them from going and finding out what some companies doing what research is and that is the part that is a threat on the web too is that you can connect in somebody is system and they do not know that you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you can yeah it is corporate espionage and i am sure that is going on and i have heard cases of it yeah well and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they will find a way you know it is nobody is found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (6254/ 8002) 
but you understand what i am saying it is you gonna have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal

Recording: (6290/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6291/ 8002) 
it is okay 

Recording: (6292/ 8002) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6293/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6294/ 8002) 
that is what we figure in a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean there is times when we did not know where he was for a week at a week at a time he i was driving lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street and that is it is it is hit pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (6295/ 8002) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to um enforce that so 

Recording: (6296/ 8002) 
uh huh 

Recording: (6297/ 8002) 
hopefully 

Recording: (6298/ 8002) 
mm 

Recording: (6299/ 8002) 
everybody needs to know that information for credit cards 

Recording: (6300/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6301/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6302/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6303/ 8002) 
now this most of my paintings were completed uh before uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before it came back out it was more of a thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it is suddenly uh you hear about it more often so that is why i am a little funny but used to be impressed like i paint star wars 

Recording: (6304/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6305/ 8002) 
i do not really work with them all i basically do is i know a lot of people and everything and they tend to come in there for help and you know and i just kinda help out with the uh 

Recording: (6306/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (6307/ 8002) 
that is true 

Recording: (6308/ 8002) 
but uh you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but that is not gonna happen in this case i do not think and the because of her age and this makes no sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so the you know they are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not want take the baby home because they are afraid of being too attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic um they 

Recording: (6309/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6310/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6311/ 8002) 
um we will i have lived in columbus all my life never <LAUGH> can not say i ever really leave too often um i have a brother sister uh obviously parents they are divorced i live with my mom um i live up around the beechwold area uh really as far as ohio state goes i am a freshman here uh just started winter quarter um i like it for the most part it is little bit much much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me just all the sorts of changes and things like that going on but other than that i mean i seem to like it i mean it is definitely changes for the better it is a lot more just free i mean i get to do whatever you want i mean there is no one watching over you saying what you have to do all the time and everything like that 

Recording: (6312/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6313/ 8002) 
five starters what you major uhhuh needle pointing finger paints journalism and um medicine okay crosswords okay gives our uh younger people some mentors look after does not it and where are your scores and those oh i am oh gee i am just barely getting by passwords you know but that is the problem we have lack of standards no that is their right keep it private but no i wish those guys would just stop hey i am i am majoring in accounting i am majoring in finance i am majoring in business and i got three point five i got two point six oh and whatever the criteria is to play on the the team why are not you playing this week well i am i am still required to practice even though i can not play this week why can not you play it is the it is the rule what rule well if i do not make certain things during the week which is academic i still hafta perform uh sports wise make that commitment but if i do not fall if i fall through on that then i am off the team period but those are things that be brought up publicized more instead of saying well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and he got this scores and this percentages and that we need to expand more on that so that the younger people have some better role model to look at and not just playing round ball or the the spiral we need to get them out there and say how you gonna perform in school ya know i am sure michael red is got some mentors out there they see guys wearing number five and whatever the number is and eight whatever it was okay they got there is a reason for it but what what is what is the other part of it we do not do that because why we do not wanna bring it up and we do not wanna bring some embarrassment possibly or but that is part of life when they get out in the real world i am talking about these guys some would be successful in terms of whomever and some will be successful in other people eyes but the thing is show the kids that are watching them hey there is more than sports sports is a by product here go to ohio state

Recording: (6343/ 8002) 
and and then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure that they kept me there but i think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable i mean i do not i do not i do not know i have never done this BEFORE SO i can not really say but i mean my feeling is the least AMOUNT OF TIME i have to be in the hospital THE HAPPIER IM GONNA BE 

Recording: (6344/ 8002)

Recording: (6345/ 8002) 
and looks like a spider web

almost made a mission film where the families living with the animals in the same house and you try to understand and and you you will never they will never get away from poverty and the classes in our society that is just life there is always gonna be that but the thing is try to have understanding compassion for them and try to reach out and sometimes the people do not want it either and sometimes you can see well now i know why they do not want it because they do not know they do not know how to handle it they appreciate the thought that goes a lot longer than just giving them that because if they get it they do not know what do with it so i i really i really think uh um as i was saying traveling uh people are all the same worldwide they just give them different colors different facial different accents so god can give them unique characteristics so he can call them his own and he knows each every one of us but uh we are all the same it is down to talking about the emotions and the drive and i keep asking her keep a one thing to ask yourself and ask the business person what would you be doing today if you were born in a third world country how thankful are you that you are here and how do you show that thankfulness

i think the one of the things that we when when you are baptized is that you are really supposed to help other people to like if if somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos you know they do not wear makeup or whatever but we we can wear makeup if we want <LAUGH> but so i think a lot of times people do fall in to sort of but i i was not raised mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i am just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i am also not afraid of people who are not mormons because i think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught i think a lot of the you know we do not drink alcohol we do not there is a lot of restrictions i guess you call them restrictions but they are i feel like they are more just health codes just keep you healthy and so um it might be it is like if we if america you know we are we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might wanna get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those barriers

Recording: (6433/ 8002) 
you know what i mean it do not matter to me whether you are black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me like when i first got out service is when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they could not hire me because of that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks 

Recording: (6434/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6435/ 8002) 
well 

Recording: (6436/ 8002) 
but like if you said i we will have a bus service we will go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even you give them a like does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you are on three shifts you can just you know here is the box of donuts and some milk or something you know that does not cost the company that much 

Recording: (6437/ 8002) 
no just a player you know i mean they lost uh four or five different uh top notch players that went to the pros and most of them are starting or you know so uh old cooper is thing is we do not rebuild we reload you know well sometimes it takes couple years to reload you know but i have never been an fan of cooper either so <LAUGH> they just says some stupid things sometimes i was listening to uh or not corby uh some show on w t v and i listen to them talk shows and everything and uh he supposedly has said something to uh he had got rid of two assistant coaches so he supposedly said something to one assistant coach said that you know i would like to hire you and everything but you are not the right color you know i mean that is not something that you would think a head coach at ohio state would say you know

Recording: (6440/ 8002) 
and i do not know whether my uh i do not think my second sister ever went to school out there but uh things were so tough that and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and uh got her teacher is certificate so i guess she and dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with us kids through the day she could teach 

Recording: (6441/ 8002)

Recording: (6446/ 8002) 
there is too much information and too much change uh librarians se and this is against probably of the image of librarians are they are very very eager to embrace change uh internet came out and ya know and when it and when it got out of the area that was being used by universities or whatever for research that is what it was at first librarians were right there they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it um when p c is we did not you know it was revolutionary when we announced we were gonna use i b m p c is for access to the system and we provide you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but with us in your computer and it is like it was incredible that i mean we had trouble with the demand it was ya know like triple what we expected librarians were ready for it 

Recording: (6447/ 8002)

Recording: (6475/ 8002) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean sort of i mean i mean i it is working well enough i guess i mean <LAUGH> like people are learning things and like wanting to go on to college and stuff 

Recording: (6476/ 8002) 
some of the work that needs be done 

Recording: (6477/ 8002)

Recording: (6483/ 8002) 
i am i am impressed i am like ok i tried to build a car and it did not look LIKE ANYTHING <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6484/ 8002) 
it is probably family by family i mean that we <LAUGH> that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there we have got two coworkers one um has her child at the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and and listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she dropped off at six a m and not picked up till six thirty p m and she is fine with that me personally there is no way because somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and she is gonna go she is she is gonna quit her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (6485/ 8002) 
yeah I THINK so i think so and like they just neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity me you know so 

Recording: (6486/ 8002) 
and she got a divorce when i was three 

Recording: (6487/ 8002) 
you do not you do not use coupons

Recording: (6489/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6490/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6491/ 8002) 
but when you look at coleman he thinks there was point where they they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (6492/ 8002) 
then you could go visit what the empire is that the big thing like the statue of liberty 

Recording: (6493/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6494/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6495/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6496/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what street its on 

Recording: (6497/ 8002) 
and that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i been crosstrained or however you wanna say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raises and i have seen me get two percent raise when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one

um about fifteen MINUTES my mom and i do not go to far FROM EACH OTHER SO but jason is gonna take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (6499/ 8002) 
i think society is today of today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there were people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh know there are bad blacks and there is bad whites too you know so but not all of them are you know are that way 

Recording: (6500/ 8002) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she still she is lives with a man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i love to cook 

Recording: (6501/ 8002) 
um i do more summer sports but um he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer illiterate i have really never had a job yet it is always been working with food or plants 

Recording: (6502/ 8002)

Recording: (6585/ 8002) 
hmm personally no i do not think so 

Recording: (6586/ 8002) 
i think the latter i do not think it will make any difference the kids that i know in uh junior high and in in you know college uh it just does not make any difference to them and they do not like those classes they think they are boring they think it has no relevance to their life 

Recording: (6587/ 8002) 
ah 

Recording: (6588/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6589/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6590/ 8002) 
oh i know it i know it that that is really what is hard 

Recording: (6591/ 8002) 
um actually oddly enough that is what i am putting in 

Recording: (6592/ 8002) 
i mean that is an 

Recording: (6593/ 8002) 
i know 

Recording: (6594/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6595/ 8002) 
yeah if they want if they you know choose i am i am sure there is you know women that are lesbians that have been with men also you know they have been with a man and then they have been with the woman now now they got a girlfriend so obviously you know and i feel like that was because they have they had a attraction towards a woman so now they think they are lesbian i do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6596/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (6597/ 8002) 
i do not know i had not thought about that uh i i do not no i do not i do not get the impression the values as anything to do with what they are doing in the school 

Recording: (6598/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6599/ 8002) 
went on but i am not sure about the rest 

Recording: (6600/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6601/ 8002) 
wow 

Recording: (6602/ 8002) 
oh i bet 

Recording: (6603/ 8002) 
em oh yeah 

Recording: (6604/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6605/ 8002) 
yeah and it is uh and it is not too bad because i had to scratch off your ticket you gave me 

Recording: (6606/ 8002) 
and they leave then you get either another asshole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good 

Recording: (6607/ 8002) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that and not uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many unwanted children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country um we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (6608/ 8002) 
have you really have you gone to seen all the shows and 

Recording: (6609/ 8002) 
we got divorced in eighty eight 

Recording: (6610/ 8002) 
or whatever femalee female so that was her name femalee she thought boy they are nice in this country they even named my baby for me people are so stupid 

Recording: (6611/ 8002) 
and that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is what we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you were um uh a parent giving a giving allowance you do not give them to your kids uh money to do chores and that you do not expect them to do but you give them something in addition to develop more responsibility but we do not talk about responsibility in our society today i i i dare you to say we are in a they say publicly this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do we talk about responsibilities now 

Recording: (6612/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6613/ 8002) 
i do uhhuh yeah 

Recording: (6614/ 8002) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two guns so and that to me was but my high school is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (6615/ 8002) 
totally like the directions and the homework and everything is all one hundred percent in german 

Recording: (6616/ 8002) 
it it is 

Recording: (6617/ 8002) 
we would like teach english to little kids or or help clean or work at libraries or different things 

Recording: (6618/ 8002) 
they they would go out there and there was um i suppose it was a county seat town and they would file a claim on a certain area of land uh it was surveyed off and marked off in sections a section of land is uh six hundred and forty acres and that sounds like a lot of it is a good sized area 

Recording: (6619/ 8002) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (6620/ 8002) 
is it 

Recording: (6621/ 8002) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (6622/ 8002) 
yeah yeah they called me like a few times and just begging me to come i know how hard that is for uh white males to get into 

Recording: (6623/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6624/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6625/ 8002) 
yeah that is want TO DO <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6626/ 8002) 
i picked eighty pounds of pot one time growing along the railroad tracks and brought it back to columbus eighty pounds 

Recording: (6627/ 8002) 
yeah it is i like it 

Recording: (6628/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (6629/ 8002) 
yeah um i have grown up here all my life so it really has not shocked me all that much 

Recording: (6630/ 8002) 
physical therapist did it yeah 

Recording: (6631/ 8002) 
and i do not like sitting in an office 

Recording: (6632/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (6633/ 8002) 
and when i started as an apprentice in the shop they said well we will start you at a dollar an hour well i thought that sounds pretty good you know in nineteen forty five in the fall of nineteen forty five so then as things worked out in washington d c they came out with the g i bill of rights we found out that uh that would apply to apprentices too 

Recording: (6634/ 8002) 
over on an adjoining hill oh about half a mile away i guess and he was getting even for the day before 

Recording: (6635/ 8002) 
do you have like any friendly animals whatsoever in in australia you know like we have we have bears in in in america it is like it is like well if they if they see 

Recording: (6636/ 8002) 
and if it is not a necessity i will have to forfeit it right now while a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras and in order to do that both have to work well consequently who is really raising the kids if they are lucky they have got a loving grandparent ninety nine times out of a hundred i do not know if that is a good statistic it is the babysitters or you know these places it is not a babysitter it is a babysitter school or something like that and that is not the same loving cuddling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids and i think that that is of things they can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence a lot of kids it is taken over their life if it is not that now it is worse yet it is the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because now you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you walk in see it and turn it off now you can go in i guess and see what they are on the internet sorry YOU can not have the internet anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program and the right person they are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (6637/ 8002) 
or or somebody or or or later they will claim that i was coerced to saying that as i walked out the door you know and it is a big lie 

Recording: (6638/ 8002) 
you can not no umhum 

Recording: (6639/ 8002) 
all right 

Recording: (6640/ 8002) 
there well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about um about the the federal lawsuit against columbus 

Recording: (6641/ 8002) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (6642/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6643/ 8002) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yet the special kid who has no area that he does not excel in like once i had a sixth grade girl who still did not know her time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i have had kids who they got every badge you can get in boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that they are really it might not be related to school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in some other area like there is swimming or or scouting or whatever so they you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than the normal person with a hundred or ninety five i q now i have seen them long enough to know that and worked with them long enough to know that well like i have one boy who can not spell them he still spells it t h i m and he took my computer apart the other day and adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works 

Recording: (6644/ 8002) 
that is good to be there 

Recording: (6645/ 8002) 
uh yeah um yes and no they are kind of weird like that um one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything there is a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racist um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people there are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racist towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously there are white you can stand they are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not wanna deal with um i mean it is basically the same thing right yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly um i really do not think we do for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would have caused a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i do not really see too many sexist problems i definitely do see guys still be more like the decision making type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure that is being a woman as causing problems to em 

Recording: (6646/ 8002) 
and they do not know any different 

Recording: (6647/ 8002) 
oh did you come in 

Recording: (6648/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6649/ 8002) 
uh his mother died um the week after we got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age eleven and just over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and did not make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse <LAUGH> IS not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (6650/ 8002) 
i mean there will be there seems to me there more one liners so i am a little disappointed i am sad that the show is going off the the show is gonna stop but i am not as sad because the product i am getting now it with the simpsons having it being replaced by futurama which ah i find to be absolute genius so it is not so bad it xfiles i am sad but not as sad based on the past couple seasons when deep space nine went off the the air that one really bothered me and they even had a star trek replacement 

Recording: (6651/ 8002) 
YKNOW I CERTAINLY would not and would i expect my mom to stay with with that in that kind of a situation no way i would want her to be happy and i would want my dad to be happy also so ultimately for that situation i think it was much better um they got married kind of young too you know and i think that i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more careful i know that that now it is a lot different than it used to be people would get married and uh they would just be expected to stay together and there is a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they are miserable 

Recording: (6652/ 8002) 
a lot a lot of people 

Recording: (6653/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6654/ 8002) 
exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home ec in high school and i was too busy with college prep and you know what good did that do me <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6655/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6656/ 8002) 
yeah i think that is you know i am i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the people fall through 

Recording: (6657/ 8002) 
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done solve them unless you unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know that is the big thing now but just that ya know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support throughout through the administration and if they do have they have to wait til something is pretty pretty egregious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (6658/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6659/ 8002) 
he is in his sophomore year

right right but during the rest of the year a lot of times we will play really really um challenging and interesting band music and you do not always get the opportunity to do that in uh musical groups yeah sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of what they expect the audience to want to hear <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6662/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6663/ 8002) 
one of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi um that is not really too hard but the hardest thing to do is electrical work like it is just because it is more intimidating

i was more comfortable here than in high school you do not see like the big cliques like the popular abercrombie wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together it is a big mix of people and everyone is doing their own thing 

Recording: (6711/ 8002) 
really why just because it is close to japan 

Recording: (6712/ 8002) 
so hard i mean every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an f and when uh my yeah oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there and once she got into it she went uh maybe not <LAUGH> so i said well what you know whatever so then she wanted to go to because it is basically a columbus public school that is geared to college only i mean if if you are not going to college do not go there because you will flunk out it is very hard and she got in the second year three weeks before school started and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of material that is got to be done in three weeks so i thought well i will just call and i called and i talked to the principal and i said you know they gave us all this stuff and you know everybody else has had june july august to get this done and she is got three weeks and she goes and the principal goes that is correct and i go well there is no way she can get this done and i said you know everybody else has had all this time and she is gonna get it done in three weeks and they go that is right so they take there is no excuses you know and it is it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because you know basically they say uh we are talking about china this week and uh on december the fifteenth we want a report on why chinese people do what they do you know and it is like and every week they do not come by and go have you started have you started have you started do you have the outline right and it is up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i have to bibliography i have to have the facts i have to interview some people and if you do not sit down with a little calendar and go this week i am getting this done this week i am getting this done and this you just fail so my oldest daughter is pretty uh detail oriented so after we kind of helped her start you know and say you know you are you are gonna hafta do these things so you get this done and i said and basically get it done like two weeks before it is done so then you can say oh this is not very good and you know amend it or whatever or or help somebody you know get somebody with typing whatever so she is really good and it is it is helped her at school a lot because i know they uh she she toured here at ohio state and there were some people here that come from cahs and they go this will be easier than your highschool <LAUGH> so 

Recording: (6713/ 8002) 
yeah we um we have two computers in our house and they both have internet on them and um it is called all advantage and they will pay you to go to websites and it is like twenty five cent an hour or something i do not remember what it was but we have not got a check yet but <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6714/ 8002) 
no sunlight you know the and they do not give him they keep it warm and he is not allowed sheets or razors or you know other than electric razors so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just the agony and the and the i think you would have to go insane like there is only so much you can i would ask for board games or something but like he does not even hear a human voice because i think it is something like that was written in the scriptures like you are dead to the world for uh is the worse that you can do and so the world sees him you know what i mean so that would be rough that would be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i would like they say like now like people that observe him he is like sings to himself and he reads the bible like everyday and but like i do not know that would be strange be such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being locked in a room for like few days 

Recording: (6715/ 8002) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest differences just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (6716/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6717/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6718/ 8002)

Recording: (6733/ 8002) 
you might think i am an idiot but you know what i mean the next person walks in the door might be real good

Recording: (6742/ 8002) 
and she says it is amazing you can give these give people numbers and they immediately use them wrong they just do not know how to use them uh they completely misinterpret even though it is very clearly stated what they are doing and uh the newspapers do that a lot too 

Recording: (6743/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6744/ 8002) 
but it was not the worry about getting pregnant it was the worry about getting aids 

Recording: (6745/ 8002) 
his yeah yeah 

Recording: (6746/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6747/ 8002) 
you know i think a lot of times uh you you know people are not real rational as far as as who they they go for 

Recording: (6748/ 8002) 
cumulonimbus or whatever you know and uh you know he was pretty much pissed off the rest the way up there because uh i was right 

Recording: (6749/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (6750/ 8002) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things in little children is minds and even you know like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence in when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were not allowed to watch it but you know i mean i mean the comics were not violent um now it is too open for kids the parents you know they say the parents should monitor them 

Recording: (6751/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6752/ 8002) 
anybody see that 

Recording: (6753/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 8002) 
somebody must have been watching over me 

Recording: (6755/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6756/ 8002) 
um since seventy four yeah 

Recording: (6757/ 8002) 
exactly 

Recording: (6758/ 8002) 
yeah my kids were both two two weeks late so i know how it is <LAUGH> <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6759/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (6760/ 8002) 
they just i am not sure really what they do 

Recording: (6761/ 8002) 
and um from downstairs we broke into my computer 

Recording: (6762/ 8002) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the school somehow for the kids and but it will not be him running it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6763/ 8002) 
it is kind of an neat place is not it 

Recording: (6764/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6765/ 8002) 
mmhmm 

Recording: (6766/ 8002) 
yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to to find that that columbus is is so out of shape um but i am in the i well you know in the circles that i move in um everybody is very middle aged and they all quit SMOKING AND THEYRE ALL ALL OF the sudden trying to beat off the reaper and um uh so you know i mean i mean well and course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and twigs and leaves anyway you know so you know that is the sort of circles i move in but i know because i have these part time jobs from time to time i see a a whole different group of people and i can say it is probably true <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6767/ 8002) 
they do not have rabies 

Recording: (6768/ 8002) 
uhuh 

Recording: (6769/ 8002) 
i am not that old yet I MIGHT LOOK IT 

Recording: (6770/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6771/ 8002) 
yeah um and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working as a freelancer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (6772/ 8002) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora you know a hat he looked so cool you know because joe paterno he always wears a tie i do not know he just he he is a great coach 

Recording: (6773/ 8002) 
but you know what i mean when he was about nine years old but he is known me all my life so you know what i mean it was not no big shock 

Recording: (6774/ 8002) 
no uh was just the usual thing since she touched my things <LAUGH> ya know because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and so ya know so that and interests so it there was not much of that but there was the usual ya know she is breathing on me in the car he is humming too loud <LAUGH> i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have probably been you have went through it all yeah well there were five of us and <LAUGH> a lot of that 

Recording: (6775/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6776/ 8002) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (6777/ 8002) 
oh really 

Recording: (6778/ 8002) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (6779/ 8002) 
you know they never ask for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and i think it just set people back now we are trying real hard to catch up and at some point we are going to um you know have to put a levy on again and and uh who knows what is happen we are keeping rosa smith right now because she is so good p r with the with the business community but the business community in columbus does not really support the schools they do not i mean we have got two new uh stadiums and we have not got any increase in school funding 

Recording: (6780/ 8002) 
yep uh my oldest she is the oldest um she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees him um and then they got two other girls and they live together got a house you know they are on they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very WELL right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got an older brother who um him and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby 

Recording: (6781/ 8002) 
oh wow 

Recording: (6782/ 8002) 
so they i have o s u insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they would not admit me they told me they were going to make wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital i crawled out of the car crawled into the hospital and told them either admit me or i would crawl out the door 

Recording: (6783/ 8002) 
so uh he finally decided uh you know after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway you know 

Recording: (6784/ 8002) 
so once you convince people that there is nothing be scared of here and there is nothing to be scared of there i mean and then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (6785/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6786/ 8002) 
in in much in much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (6787/ 8002) 
just 

Recording: (6788/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6789/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6790/ 8002) 
we did not know you know anything about what he did or we found out more um after he died 

Recording: (6791/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6792/ 8002) 
the 

Recording: (6793/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6794/ 8002) 
um and like even the people the maybe their apartments did not look as impressive but they were making money 

Recording: (6795/ 8002) 
things you know collecting but it is hard with my sister is cats because she has a little girl and no she did not go home and vacuum every day you know but um 

Recording: (6796/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6797/ 8002) 
so uh i had some family responsibilities we were my brother and i and my sisters were active in the four h clubs 

Recording: (6798/ 8002) 
it is in the accounting department 

Recording: (6799/ 8002) 
i get wick that is it <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6800/ 8002) 
and that is what i am saying atoning for sins it is quite a hypocrisy when you got a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i asked the priest cold hard question 

Recording: (6801/ 8002) 
you know what happened like in the same year eighty eight you know so but it was it was pretty tough but i just did not deal with it properly you know i should have went and got counseling and by the way i probably should have got marriage counseling but i refused to do that too so but i did not think i had a problem i thought she was the one with one 

Recording: (6802/ 8002) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (6803/ 8002) 
the university never has money that is like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two or two jobs for ten years when i was here the first ten years just to make a living 

Recording: (6804/ 8002) 
yes umhum 

Recording: (6805/ 8002) 
that awesome there is there is a lot of stuff to do down there if you like outdoors <LAUGH> i bet 

Recording: (6806/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6807/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> yeah i do not know where they are going now but 

Recording: (6808/ 8002) 
i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know well 

Recording: (6809/ 8002) 
i think so 

Recording: (6810/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6811/ 8002) 
yeah he was he is gonna always be reelected he is got his yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6812/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (6813/ 8002) 
you know for me getting out of bed is is a victory you know for the longest time i was so depressed you know but the animals you know yeah using the animals uh uh for therapy animal therapy um i mean dogs in particular cats um but know there is uh there is some animals that are not to be pets you know um they are wild animals you know and yeah i saw a show last week on fox that was called when good pets go bad too 

Recording: (6814/ 8002) 
i had not heard that one well i did see on tv late news after you would gone to bed last night i saw where there is another airplane went down as it took off from kennedy airport it was uh an egyptian airline was not it and it had come to new york kennedy airport flew all the way across the united states to california for some reason then it went back all the way over here and then it had just taken off and what were they not even a half an hour or whatever out in the ocean where out out over the ocean and all at once the plane went whoom in thirty seconds or something i mean it was down from what was it thirty thousand feet or something they must have they had to have been dead before they reached the water because of with that sudden decline boy that would make you pass out if nothing else would and they are now they are trying to decide was it sabotage was there something wrong with the plane was it pilot error and so i do not know if if there is gonna be more sabotage stuff going on the way some of those countries fight over there in the other countries and try to get us involved i do not know i hope not i pray to god that something then all the good people are trying to say no god is going to come back and salvage the world and all the good people will be here and probably the bad people maybe he will take the good people and make it a better world for us and the rest of them will suddenly die I DONT KNOW 

Recording: (6815/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> uhhuh uhhuh what instrument do you play 

Recording: (6816/ 8002) 
he ended up dying he ended up dying from um what is that disease aids thank you from the aids virus that is going around when he was near dying what did he tell his mother i will not use the exact words because there was profanity in it but he said i really up my life did not i mom and he is got three kids three grown kids right now so you see what made him change what influence in society do that i do not know how we find it but i think if more people i do not think it was ever taught in the bible to do that was it and i i really do not think so and i do not ever you know hear it i am not that well versed when it comes to the BIBLE <LAUGH> but uh i do believe there is a god and i do believe in prayer and i do believe in guardian angels watching over you and i do not think you have to go to church to really believe all this because it is how you treat the other person that really counts and if i treat that person basically it boils down to treat the other person the way you would like to be treated 

Recording: (6817/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (6818/ 8002) 
my mom teaches there so it is free tuition i get a tuition waiver 

Recording: (6819/ 8002)

Recording: (6820/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6821/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (6822/ 8002) 
no the lifestyle was you know very easy to fit into and i have always been you know interested it and you know sort of like to the whole like european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and you know studying english here is a dime a dozen and studying english in or in england is you know sort of i do not know uh more uh sort of elitist which i did not realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american and the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and a it there were a few classes that really stood out where you know there was sort of you know you would i would hafta say something or i would hafta give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh you know what what does this american know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes i mean not directly they would never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of uh 

Recording: (6823/ 8002) 
you know always something going on 

Recording: (6824/ 8002) 
i will even went to the they got a food one over here by the vet clinic 

Recording: (6825/ 8002) 
there is very definitely 

Recording: (6826/ 8002) 
right well why do you have to do anything with it 

Recording: (6827/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (6828/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (6829/ 8002) 
i dislike i can not take any more of it 

Recording: (6830/ 8002) 
uh north end over by riverside hospital 

Recording: (6831/ 8002) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (6832/ 8002) 
she is she is wonderful but back then they were there was the sixties and they were hippies and you know my moms got long jet black hair and they are wearing their army outfits and they are whatever you know everybody is got bellbottoms and my dads got long hair down to here and everything so they lived like seventeenth avenue for a while and we lived um like i said on summit until i was about three years old and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was which was which great for me i mean my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom and i would do fun stuff and it and and i i never remember it being negative 

Recording: (6833/ 8002) 
i am retired 

Recording: (6834/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6835/ 8002) 
would i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them things thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a place a lot better place and along with the politicians they stop saying now what is really best for the general public instead of well we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (6836/ 8002) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you <LAUGH> yeah yeah 

Recording: (6837/ 8002) 
i know i do not 

Recording: (6838/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (6839/ 8002) 
no big deal 

Recording: (6840/ 8002) 
but we still need to have property manager records that is very essential and a lot times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it um they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it is been uh installed removed relocated whatever might be but we need know that how it had an impact upon the design of a the particular uh facility voice and data 

Recording: (6841/ 8002) 
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba to united states that is found at sea is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is that is the premise he is operating on uh you know and the news media they have not really been a they just they have not been real objective about it i mean uh you know like there two fisherman that found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him i was reading about him news week or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (6842/ 8002) 
um you know it is stuff like that it is like it is kind of neat because you do not have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (6843/ 8002) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (6844/ 8002) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i know it is like i mean it is the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but just seems more apparent just because of how but you can like go outside all the time you know i mean there is never like three or four months where you just wanna sit in your house and 

Recording: (6845/ 8002) 
yeah like it is just it is killing it is own citizens it is so ridiculous 

Recording: (6846/ 8002) 
it was right 

Recording: (6847/ 8002) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (6848/ 8002) 
and was threatening kids with it and so they suspended him 

Recording: (6849/ 8002) 
so they get more buying power if they go there okay 

Recording: (6850/ 8002) 
yeah uh she might know her name is she is um on the school board now 

Recording: (6851/ 8002)

Recording: (6863/ 8002) 
three years i have them usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth for those language arts subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get phased out like right now i am phasing a kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still a terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context you know so we are in the process of phasing him out so that he will not have to he is had help i think since he was in kindergarten that is the other thing that is really an enigma about these kids ninety percent of the time their i q is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean they are very bright but yet something is not 

Recording: (6864/ 8002)

which they have to 

Recording: (6886/ 8002) 
warriors that are out there men and women that will do that uh more power to them uh all i can do is pray about it and that is what i suggest to everybody else that is the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the nuns in high school that taught me had a poster on the wall that said more things are wrought in this world by prayer then we will ever know 

Recording: (6887/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6888/ 8002) 
well if it did not say i always look back and look at this there were how many thousands maybe millions of years before christ and here we are two thousand years after christ what makes us think we are not gonna live through this ten fifteen twenty fifty thousand years beyond i can not believe unless there is some thing like us our planet colliding with another planet or something that would destroy everything 

Recording: (6889/ 8002) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (6890/ 8002)

and call her tammy when she is little 

Recording: (6895/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (6896/ 8002) 
all i remember is them talking about condoms i do not think they talked about anything besides that but um then again i could BE REMEMBERING WRONG um but yes that i mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was a catholic school but we did not have nuns or anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know it it actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a like eight grade that they talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (6897/ 8002) 
i mean i i i mean that probably can be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that you know it would be the influence of tv you know the and then and another thing that is well tv is the uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now 

Recording: (6898/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (6899/ 8002)

Recording: (6904/ 8002) 
does not bother me at all 

Recording: (6905/ 8002) 
that movie was good makes you think like right now i am cold and when you see it you will know what i am talking about like coldness 

Recording: (6906/ 8002) 
um but yeah i do not know yeah i think it is like there is like a real like either it is it is old people who are there retiring or whatever or it is more of like a younger people there i do not know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middle aged people there but it is not so apparent like as here i guess 

Recording: (6907/ 8002) 
right well that is something i have noticed in the local news particularly they say exclusively on our channel and stuff and it is usually not that big of a deal what they are talking about uh but they are making a big point that you heard it here first and i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make 

Recording: (6908/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6909/ 8002) 
i am comfortable 

Recording: (6910/ 8002) 
oh projects were right from infancy were i was designing the project first of all we had to find out what we had with the vesture and uh as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the telephone company does not provide the service to you anymore well we had to know what we had through out the state of ohio and some eighty eight counties and uh wherever else number of facilities we had and so we went on a scavenger hunt 

Recording: (6911/ 8002) 
uh it is 

Recording: (6912/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (6913/ 8002) 
well um the one that is um god 

Recording: (6914/ 8002) 
yeah no oh man that was 

Recording: (6915/ 8002) 
i worked for a company called highlights for children 

Recording: (6916/ 8002) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had epilepsy they would lock you in closet and throw away the key and would not let you out most the parent i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids with a step parent 

Recording: (6917/ 8002) 
um it i mean it was pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there 

Recording: (6918/ 8002) 
right that is good 

Recording: (6919/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (6920/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (6921/ 8002) 
oh no no i do not feel that at all they you know we do not hesitate our to get together with other friends and take our kids places i do not remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or something you know i do not remember things like that you know he could have been there maybe but 

Recording: (6922/ 8002) 
he has ah he has not questioned me like that but i see a lot of things coming out he is doing more in why he is been doing things about more differently than my daughter cause my daughter was away at school and he is with us everyday so he is home every does not wanna stay on campus uh and uh it is he does things voluntarily we do not have to coach him he is working with a lot of other people i mean the what he is been reared with coached with and so forth it is somewhat imbedded he sees that and matter of fact some of the girls he is dating uh they see that in him and i think that is a quality they they say gee and and i i i i give them thanks because uh say hey you know it is it is rough out there because uh and and the guys he runs around with good quality guys i thought wow you know they are ornery sure but uh i i would not i would not trade his friends for anything gosh uh i do not know how i came up with him i myself but 

Recording: (6923/ 8002) 
that is what a small world <LAUGH> 

Recording: (6924/ 8002) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion what he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and that he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be catholic great if he does not that is okay too 

Recording: (6925/ 8002) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they obviously they are gonna get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parent is fault i mean i there are a lot of people i mean i think just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting that happened couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it and the parent like left in a top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it i mean as far as that goes i mean there is really nothing more he could do i mean 

Recording: (6926/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> that is just ridiculous too THOUGH but yeah that is to me that is really weird i do not like i said i do not know what they are what they are thinking it orwhat their thought process was but i am thinking maybe it the social because a lot to me a high school is real social 

Recording: (6927/ 8002) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (6928/ 8002)

Recording: (6931/ 8002)

Recording: (6932/ 8002) 
well um that is i do not know how to explain that ESPECIALLY IF ANYBODYS GONNA LISTEN to this um i had a friend that taught classes human potential classes was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement so um uh a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett uh who really is the father of the human potential movement moved out there and he was gonna have a group of people work out there and uh and he said that you know i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through you know and we all just lived our lives but i was glad that you know that he got me out there BECAUSE I ADORED IT <LAUGH> i i just loved it out there 

Recording: (6933/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6934/ 8002) 
kept promoting and then all of sudden about nineties they came around and said hey you know what our our deficit is going the other way we are we are going way out of whack on this thing that is because we have been spending more consumers are doing the same thing they have not learned that mom and dad remember mom when out and got a little piece as the time as they needed things no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars we do not talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty soon we are not gonna be buying houses we will be leasing houses from the finance companies we will not be owning the land the finance company own the you do not own it you are leasing it and that is our quality of life and when we go to third world countries we say i do not know how they can stand living here and yet you know what they probably have better quality of understanding one another then we do because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you become apart 

Recording: (6935/ 8002)

Recording: (6983/ 8002) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6984/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (6985/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6986/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (6987/ 8002) 
but most the time it is not it is not bad um so there is there is that it is an opportunity for the musicians in the college to play in an orchestra and and what else do they get out of it i do not know prestige a suppose <LAUGH> yeah 

Recording: (6988/ 8002) 
well we do not wanna know she is the only one that wants to know her her um boyfriend he does not wanna know either and so sara decided that she could not go and find out the sex of it because she could not keep a secret yeah so so anyhow we do not we just do not know 

Recording: (6989/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (6990/ 8002) 
he yeah he show a picture one oh that is hu man chu or YKNOW 

Recording: (6991/ 8002) 
german yeah 

Recording: (6992/ 8002) 
wow um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community based programs getting but again those are my values as i say steering the kids into a church based program if they can not be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them giving them the guidance they need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (6993/ 8002) 
and i do not agree with that either 

Recording: (6994/ 8002) 
and he is very opinionated and it is interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing uh you can tell that he is thought he is uh thought about it and his you know clearly formulated what his stance is on it and he is very articulate about it uh sometimes his responses are immature but he is nineteen 

Recording: (6995/ 8002) 
well it obviously i sort of surmounted that because i have been you know i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then you know after that you know you just sort of yeah get to the point where you are just kinda you know laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then 

Recording: (6996/ 8002) 
selling time for money yes 

Recording: (6997/ 8002) 
yeah i know i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen in high school so we kind of grew up together and i did not know anything else and um just two complete different people you know different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (6998/ 8002) 
oh you did not 

Recording: (6999/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (7000/ 8002) 
adoption is different i think though that when adoption is entirely different than when you can see but somebody else is sperm or somebody else is whatever uh because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here it is again you are reaching out to your friend your neighbor you are not just forgetting about him and let the welfare or somebody take care of him and let him go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is and and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is love and when you are trying and willing to have well some people probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what genes they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not <LAUGH> later on you will find out but it still you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are gonna be able to trace these genes back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

Recording: (7001/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7002/ 8002) 
some ideals ideas about it so i figure it is something i should know about so <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7003/ 8002) 
i i i do not think it is necessarily that i think it is comes back to the lack of self discipline 

Recording: (7004/ 8002) 
um the reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it is in a incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers in um i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions <LAUGH> as a matter of fact the that is only thing i difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these INCREDIBLE QUESTIONS AND I WOULD BE trying to DO THE DISHES OR SOMETHING MUNDANE LIKE that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions

my dad like 

Recording: (7014/ 8002) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of of of black people in many ways in retrospect it was trend setting and what it did in in even in putting blacks in um advertisements on t v young kids saw them uh and saw those ads and saw those t v programs and so it became uh a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those t v programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical um but it i am sure it does have uh some influence because i think it did it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (7015/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7016/ 8002)

Recording: (7019/ 8002) 
where they can go everyday the way i look at it also too uh when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was fourteen you can not even find a job unless you are sixteen nowadays 

Recording: (7020/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7021/ 8002)

Recording: (7027/ 8002) 
cause there is some people that actually can not work 

Recording: (7028/ 8002)

Recording: (7040/ 8002) 
they will also give them let them work seventy five percent if they are sick i had a heart attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave and like i said i have been here twenty five years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it was not a good enough reason

Recording: (7063/ 8002) 
their daycare oh i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of daycare offered it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice of cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a toss up it is a real 

Recording: (7064/ 8002) 
i know well you you get to take advantage of it for layovers and stuff it is 

Recording: (7065/ 8002)

Recording: (7088/ 8002) 
yeah the one thing they have done is they have put on bigger airplanes because it used to be you know you like a uh say uh seven thirty seven would go from here to new york city and now it is a seven fifty seven so that adds more seats so instead of because i when i first got there i could not understand at o s u when it was like christmas time or something it was just you would drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you are like oh boy <LAUGH>

Recording: (7194/ 8002) 
well i know people that will sleep outside and uh not all of them are veterans and everything but they there again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh staying at an open shelter v o a or something like that

Recording: (7206/ 8002) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need that need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (7207/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7208/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7209/ 8002) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jibes about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple a english friends and to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and it we got lost and all these things that took us way longer than it should have and a friend of the person we were visiting said like oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonalds along the way and i was like i i am a VEGETARIAN i do not even eat at mcdonalds you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it is like that is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said mcdonalds would not survive here if no one ate there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7210/ 8002) 
no i you had women that working before you had women working before but self discipline is family it is part of it self discipline making things too easy for us oh we can not do without it you ever you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7211/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7212/ 8002)

well i will have a <LAUGH> maybe when i i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7214/ 8002) 
or does this say this you know this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and of what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestibules 

Recording: (7215/ 8002) 
so um 

Recording: (7216/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7217/ 8002) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (7218/ 8002) 
yeah just since march 

Recording: (7219/ 8002) 
and there is lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls 

Recording: (7220/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7221/ 8002) 
existing area mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7222/ 8002) 
light news uh that is why i read tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a different perspective it is it is probably just as slanted but it is different you are right 

Recording: (7223/ 8002) 
then i 

Recording: (7224/ 8002) 
i think so because i i 

Recording: (7225/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7226/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7227/ 8002) 
and then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (7228/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7229/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7230/ 8002) 
actually they are they are working on it i am sorry i did not mean to interrupt you uh um they have they have um just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty level i think is considered um thirteen thousand pounds a year um and if if you are below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yeah so there is a bonus for back to work you mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for FOR WHATEVER reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but um there i mean i do not really think and a lot of situations of course i i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really you know taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like their kids see none of that money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered you know and you know those you know a lot of there is there documentaries on all the time there so you really it is sort of it is more in your face than it is here at that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if a if a kid has bad behavior or you know bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying you know hotwiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do not know i think i do have SORT OF VERY STRONG OPINIONS about people yeah who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all 

Recording: (7231/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7232/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7233/ 8002) 
does that make sense 

Recording: (7234/ 8002)

Recording: (7239/ 8002) 
well then they had uh after that they had the lottery number and that was not if you were hot you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know which would be worse knowing that you are gonna get a notice and being able to prepare for it or uh because i have had friends that got uh numbers and everything you know and and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god so 

Recording: (7240/ 8002) 
well not really they uh have a lot of um religious beliefs on their own that they have had held on to because um they have just have had nothing 

Recording: (7241/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7242/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7243/ 8002)

umhum umhum <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7247/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7248/ 8002) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know it was six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at o s u and they were um just asking people if they thought that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i was like well i think so yeah <LAUGH> and but i did not i was kinda hesitant i mean it took me a while to i read the book of mormon i really prayed about it and took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really liked it and it was what i had been wanting so so that is how i decided 

Recording: (7249/ 8002) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (7250/ 8002) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him 

Recording: (7251/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7252/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7253/ 8002) 
blond haired blue eyed overweight people 

Recording: (7254/ 8002) 
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here but it worked out 

Recording: (7255/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7256/ 8002) 
is that right 

Recording: (7257/ 8002) 
with their cycle uh that is the way the indian people believe that many of the woman refer to it as they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can not do that um there is just a lot there that uh you know women go through that purification every month so women really do not need the sweat lodge but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (7258/ 8002) 
i am gonna get done with this i swear <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7259/ 8002) 
and they would ask you know can i do this can i use this uh kids now if i take my phone off and lay it on my desk kids will walk right up and just take it they will not ask me they will just oh and then they start pushing is this your phone i am like uh if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you would not like it much would you 

Recording: (7260/ 8002) 
umhum it is real well known 

Recording: (7261/ 8002) 
okay <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7262/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7263/ 8002) 
but it just depends upon it still come back to who you know 

Recording: (7264/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7265/ 8002) 
that is because it is kind of like warm and tropical that is why they like it down there 

Recording: (7266/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (7267/ 8002) 
but 

Recording: (7268/ 8002) 
no offense 

Recording: (7269/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7270/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7271/ 8002) 
oh what are you doing that for oh 

Recording: (7272/ 8002) 
umhum hum 

Recording: (7273/ 8002) 
um not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage are gonna go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually it is this is is very hot topic in england right now because they they have got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing they are there you know they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just you know uh because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be you know safe about it 

Recording: (7274/ 8002) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think i at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get healthcare for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like people are always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7275/ 8002) 
yeah she still lives with family 

Recording: (7276/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7277/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (7278/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7279/ 8002) 
oh my 

Recording: (7280/ 8002) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because uh <laugh=nobody ishouse> is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (7281/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7282/ 8002) 
oh yeah yeah it is like what religion are you <LAUGH> oh that one it has all those those great rules thatdo not work out in real life christianity YEAH <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7283/ 8002) 
right no 

Recording: (7284/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7285/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7286/ 8002) 
i mean i 

Recording: (7287/ 8002) 
it is like like sometimes too i think about people you know they call and especially when i talk to this sometimes people call in and i i you know i get the same people or whatever every once in a while especially if like there is people have real specific weird names or something that i can remember i will they will call back and i will think about them and it is like how i will have this you know it is like we have this weird like five minute relationship something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it is like what to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like in the you know it is like it is real weird it is like i know yeah get everybody 

Recording: (7288/ 8002) 
right um and and it is sometimes that opens um the person up because a child they are so innocent and you can not help but love them and i know my mom had a big problem with the whole inter racial 

Recording: (7289/ 8002) 
OH REALLY <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7290/ 8002) 
no that is interesting though because i think i think that um that my whole i i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (7291/ 8002) 
well they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they um try to intervene with their family put them back with their family or um maybe call in children is sevices and i and i just really do not think much of children is services so 

Recording: (7292/ 8002) 
actually um i went back i came back to ohio state um in see ninety three through ninety five and got a teaching certificate in for secondary science and i taught for a year a at a small school in lancaster catholic high school down there and um left there uh part of was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so that was probably one of the biggest problems i had but uh 

Recording: (7293/ 8002) 
but uh she likes the spirituality of the community over there and 

Recording: (7294/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7295/ 8002) 
you know if it does not affect them it is not there and if they do not have to 

Recording: (7296/ 8002) 
sure 

Recording: (7297/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7298/ 8002) 
he wants to yeah 

Recording: (7299/ 8002) 
yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school i went to i mean i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7300/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7301/ 8002) 
uh okay well there few years ago there was this big fuss so ya know we have got to close some schools ya know enrollment is dropping it is ya know it is the way population goes enrollment is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so let us close and they did this big study and they targeted some to close well there was a big uproar from the people who is kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close a school so the board backed down and changed it is mind the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there was not the money for it so there was a big fuss about that then two years later they came out with another study it says well they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple then knock some down and rebuild em and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not gonna like well if you are gonna shut a school down somebody is gonna be really ticked off 

Recording: (7302/ 8002) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them a better school um i think a lot of it is is is really what you what uh as far as as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced a p classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think that they have options 

Recording: (7303/ 8002) 
do not get i do not think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they they raise money from the businesses in the community plus we charge for tickets <LAUGH> for people to come and see us and sometimes it is sometimes we get a lot sometimes we do not get so many turns out the concerts we get the most the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we have children is choir <LAUGH> because 

Recording: (7304/ 8002) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a c or a b i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing at our school that it is it looks just like notebook paper and it is got the three holes and the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but it is n c r you know the two copies 

Recording: (7305/ 8002) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and uh close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just as exciting it is still just as good and yeah he amazes me everyday because i am i am one to all this will not last forever but you know <LAUGH> and he is like well when we are ninety <LAUGH> you know you will know <LAUGH> so 

Recording: (7306/ 8002)

Recording: (7307/ 8002) 
and he did that too uh 

Recording: (7308/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7309/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> okay 

Recording: (7310/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> 

Recording: (7311/ 8002) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and pornography and you know things things that we you know when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was in to you know lassie and tom and jerry i mean you know these but you know they were not violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i i just think i do not think it could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (7312/ 8002) 
right right 

Recording: (7313/ 8002) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it is more of like a it is not like an m t v type thing you know 

Recording: (7314/ 8002)

oh i think that is good 

Recording: (7323/ 8002) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her um but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are ashamed about things and they should not be ashamed because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (7324/ 8002)

where 

Recording: (7347/ 8002)

you know when she is in her middle years and tamara when she is you know but you know i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing it is the one thing in life we get to do where there is no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or parameters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 

Recording: (7350/ 8002) 
well i do not know that that is a cause uh a it they they as a group uh and this was kind of a happenstance it this occurred as a result of a very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing it it was there was a happenstance and and part of this mass communication we are talking about uh began with them and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you are talking about uh a a greater inter communication i would like to go back one step where we are talking about when i made mention that three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we are nearing zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody inner personal communications that is the key in my opinion personal versus inner personal communications and it is zero over here and we are almost a hundred percent over here but when we are in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate um john doe who speak here he has not the faintest idea who jane doe is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person over here that is jane doe that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson do not you remember old henry well henry was the guy that lived way over there on the other side of town mass communications as it is today they have not the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where old whoever IT WAS LIVED OVER THERE I SAID so i think uh the i i think you need to distinguish between the personal inner personal relationship so maybe i digress too far there or who the next door neighbor is

Recording: (7453/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7454/ 8002) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the nineties that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain things we did or did not do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there was so many things that changed and some i think one thing like it stands out and this has nothing do with politics but it is an example in in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geometry and algebra you would think yet i used to get straight as in algebra and when i got to geometry i thought why am i taking this so that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are reteaching it entirely different now and i think linda explained it how they were doing it with math here and said she could not even help him and so you know it is in the same way with politics it people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but then my mother USED TO SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT OUR GENERATION so i think it is just a sign of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (7455/ 8002) 
yeah she she had a talk and my sister and i attended and i do not like the problem i think with universal healthcare would be everyone do not you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would go in you know as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance it i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you do not wanna put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year

yeah um it is awareness again i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of of college and then you put em with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean you can not even you can not control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can um put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and you know and they have got stairs up and down and you know they get in their lockers and they bend over you know and that is that is just too much i mean i think that is the first thing that has to be done take away that you know they should not even be uh that should not even be a thought you know and it is distracting enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they are single guys that were just had a hell of a time in hall in college and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh well you know you gotta look at that you gotta be more aware 

Recording: (7557/ 8002) 
she does not so much mind anymore i mean since i have turned eighteen i mean ever since then it is been no problem or anything i mean she is sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (7558/ 8002)

Recording: (7559/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7560/ 8002) 
i have done it for the last uh bout five years 

Recording: (7561/ 8002) 
oh 

Recording: (7562/ 8002)

they are like why do not you pitch you know be happy for the indians i am like i am happy for them that is fine but 

Recording: (7565/ 8002) 
but having having done it before you know and uh knowing where i went wrong you know uh that would not happen again uh talk about all that shit for a while but that was again that was back in the uh actually it was in the nineties early nineties but you know i was been doing it when we were we were as a recreation type of thing you know not as a uh daily you know umhum somebody come knocking on our door oh yeah okay oh yeah oh yeah yeah stupid but i would like to do something like that then uh uh i would not mind having uh uh some kind of place for uh you know you see a lot of uh different down and out type people and everything and and really nobody really trying to help them or nothing you know and uh uh i like to think that maybe even this thing you know could be like a sanctuary for them to come in and get some peace of mind or something you know so umhum 

Recording: (7566/ 8002) 
control problems of course there is always a leak somewhere yeah well it could be hot water they send out heat and hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that it is drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and that is why it quit hm yeah THEN run quick <LAUGH> put plastic up oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of autoworkers you think of pipefitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of people and that is very hard to negotiate for anybody you know when you are talking raises and lots of money like this which what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades are not real big participaters in the union you know we just ride along and from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here is it seemed that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longer you know and so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you KNOW if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that lines so you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will yeah it is against yeah it is against the union contracts so you have just 

Recording: (7567/ 8002) 
um hum 

Recording: (7568/ 8002) 
no 

Recording: (7569/ 8002) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean uh i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and the education and a lot you know then most of probably the people that this would um concern but i do think i i do not know i mean with uh the birth control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if you know the the man is not willing to do it or whatever so and and and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7570/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7571/ 8002)

Recording: (7584/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7585/ 8002)

Recording: (7695/ 8002) 
really 

Recording: (7696/ 8002) 
civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal and fair society um some my leftist positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where where in the social stratum where you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these cla i mean i i do not want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations cause it is not the exact same as say class was in the marx is sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is gonna buy a house for your family and let them live in a relative comfort i mean in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual 

Recording: (7697/ 8002)

Recording: (7708/ 8002)

Recording: (7709/ 8002) 
and that is been almost ten years so hopefully 

Recording: (7710/ 8002) 
okay 

Recording: (7711/ 8002) 
i do not know i i kind of see al gore winning just because he is the most like 

Recording: (7712/ 8002)

about once a week my wife sees her usually more than me 

Recording: (7715/ 8002) 
yes 

Recording: (7716/ 8002) 
yeah yeah i if if a there there can not be sanctions for doing the right thing and um uh so i would be i am opposed to that i well yeah i i guess you would have to say that i was i be opposed to arresting mothers for anything um in in in that relation that it is just that the effort should focus on on getting them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they are doing 

Recording: (7717/ 8002) 
so i mean it is that is what i am saying the uh i think it is even american disabilities act talks about certain things about employers um and and with my lawsuit you know with the uh the chill and you know with all the public trials of high profile trials i think it is education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work um is not fair it is a rich man is person or a rich person is system judges are bought and paid for they are elected um there is a lot of crap there and learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribes and that is that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so um i did not wanna go into law <LAUGH> did not wanna go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept hounding me and telling me you know well maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like why would i wanna make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a liar i bring him out you know and uh i was just brought up to be an honest person and um unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they sell out their ideals and their principles for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family or their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out i am not that kind of person and i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life then so be it you know i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there BUT THATS you know that is basically where i have been you know um i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball um due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro caliber you know uh i played baseball with the with paul oneil and kent murker which are a couple of guys that you know did get signed PROFESSIONALLY and are playing right now um so at least i can say i played against them and uh least with kent murker i can say i hit a home run off of him so that was a while ago but that was when he was young and very good AND I WAS i was three or four years older and still took him deep to center field so i will never forget that but uh i earned that <LAUGH> so that is um well um well that uh you know i i do not refer to it as an accident anymore you know they are um my whole life it changed ah in every facet um from it um you know physically emotionally mentally and spiritually um used to be catholic i do not follow that way anymore and um yeah i follow more uh ah natural way of following god nothing uh new age i do not wanna say exactly what you know just say that the people this land long time ago before anybody came over here with their bibles and crap um ramming jesus down people is throat the people of this land had a way of worshipping god and that is the way i wanna that is the way i follow um so a lot of people say that is native AMERICAN or say that is indian or whatever you know i do not care what they wanna put on it but it is it is that is a natural way of following god it is the way i put it you know worshipping that there and respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and uh so i went through all that all those changes and uh are still you know coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to 

Recording: (7718/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7719/ 8002)

Recording: (7722/ 8002) 
too much 

Recording: (7723/ 8002) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway <LAUGH> but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of um not cutting down the ones i did not like that much <LAUGH> yeah yeah 

Recording: (7724/ 8002) 
he is 

Recording: (7725/ 8002) 
but it was not because it caught fire and that time he was burned on the back 

Recording: (7726/ 8002) 
as a toddler and it is it is not intentional it is just the way he is so he was able to circumvent anything that the psychologist was trying till he had finally admitted it yeah he had a problem and then things went much more smoothly and that there is still not really convinced of the diagnosis cause there is multiple problems and they have not ruled out that some of the other things yet he could he just knew how to get around anything 

Recording: (7727/ 8002) 
uh 

Recording: (7728/ 8002) 
it is the grocery we USE <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7729/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7730/ 8002) 
almost all the parents did 

Recording: (7731/ 8002) 
okay that is a good job i mean because you can get flex time yeah it was 

Recording: (7732/ 8002) 
yeah it says 

Recording: (7733/ 8002) 
i was working out there 

Recording: (7734/ 8002) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (7735/ 8002) 
it helps the curve <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7736/ 8002) 
umhum sure 

Recording: (7737/ 8002) 
no that is one thing that uh you know i found was really lacking here um for my son uh 

Recording: (7738/ 8002) 
i mean obviously being uh being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (7739/ 8002) 
he is really just <LAUGH> yeah he just does not think through the implications of things real well in his personal life 

Recording: (7740/ 8002) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (7741/ 8002) 
yeah jason and and i and i went together 

Recording: (7742/ 8002) 
and you even got these the uh what stunt guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (7743/ 8002) 
it does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i said just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (7744/ 8002) 
see it there again the business out foxed the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another trying to understand your neighbor more and spending time giving quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investments gone 

Recording: (7745/ 8002) 
oh she is a cute she really is really cute i mean i mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks 

Recording: (7746/ 8002) 
columbus needs that as much people do not want other things to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (7747/ 8002) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7748/ 8002) 
uhhum 

Recording: (7749/ 8002) 
like to me that was very strange 

Recording: (7750/ 8002) 
so he is gonna be somebody can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they wanna do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it it is individuality again so 

Recording: (7751/ 8002) 
<LAUGH> yeah it is weird like i do not know this microphone is a little bit different so 

Recording: (7752/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7753/ 8002) 
i love IT <LAUGH> 

Recording: (7754/ 8002) 
umhum it is at it is at the same building actually it is it is it is used for different things 

Recording: (7755/ 8002) 
no i mean the money you know the money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went out on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not wanna be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget and you know the u hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they are thirty five million in the hole because they bought o s u east and all this but you know it is not the unions fault that they ran out the contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they are not willing to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always gonna have to have people here to because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (7756/ 8002) 
right 

Recording: (7757/ 8002) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (7758/ 8002) 
um i mean i feel i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human rights side was that if they are you know on cocaine or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (7759/ 8002) 
because see well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talked about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (7760/ 8002) 
uh no that is okay i ya know do not i just do not want to touch it i just 

Recording: (7761/ 8002) 
the reds and indians 

Recording: (7762/ 8002) 
it was probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (7763/ 8002) 
so 

Recording: (7764/ 8002)

Recording: (7768/ 8002)

Recording: (7779/ 8002) 
uh i have thought about that it is sad i am i have i mean that is why i have not went to college or anything because there was nothing my mind is set on that i want to do in life i just want to be rich <LAUGH>

Recording: (7796/ 8002) 
yeah because it is the midwest yeah 

Recording: (7797/ 8002) 
umhum i am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere along the line that they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps it would not be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is the intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character in a person to bring about the spirituality in a person that is gonna carry them all through life she is also um tithing more than tithing probably uh which uh i always uh kid with people i said the author said ten percent tithing knew inflation he knew great about economics ten percent is ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we talked about economics uh little further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the and germans so forth and uh boy you know taking that page out of the old bible are not they we do not <LAUGH>

Recording: (7806/ 8002) 
umhum 

Recording: (7807/ 8002) 
yeah like they all get the option but i i understand very few exercise it so you know if you were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are using and then give them the two dollars an hour you know the but then that could then you could say that o s u is helping to keep people down and so you have to still it is a it is an odd balance there it is and like uh it is something like that does not seem too skilled to me so the i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but yeah obviously the

actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the a d h d and some have a d h d without the learning disability and some have both and you can have a d d without having the hyperactive part you can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hypo activity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window and like they are the one that says i did not hear what what was the question and uh they are they are a d d and they can not quite focus and distract they can not screen out the distractions but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are kind of the they are the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle those are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling they are kind of spaced out and daydreaming and and takes a long time to realize hey this kid can not focus but with the kid that is all over the place and doing a tapping this kids chair and the kid goes make him stop tapping my chair YKNOW you can see right away that he can not focus because when you are he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he is like all over the place while you are explaining he is not listening you are trying to show him something he will not look at it you know it is like people often say a d d kids can not focus or can not attend to anything but what is really happening is they attend to everything 

Recording: (7873/ 8002)

Recording: (7883/ 8002) 
and um it it is great we have been reengineered last eight years o dot downsizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the attributes the person brings to work as opposed to not one of the problems i i see as an as an employer or as a supervisor manager a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order to get up there they do not take in consideration the attributes the person has and so now we are saying okay if you bring this attribute to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you instead of putting you over here in let us say a managerial position which you really do not have any call for but you are there because the money only okay so we are trying to fit the attribute to the person compensate them accordingly which hey if i think we did that we would probably have more teachers 

Recording: (7884/ 8002) 
and why do not people use their time you know and it is free you know rather they get all tensed up and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of the way because they got to get there you know

to melt and soften the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire you have ever touched or been around and that fire is sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down there with the laws of physics told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they are red orange glowing you gonna tell me they are not hot so that is that is one example um

Recording: (7939/ 8002) 
well some of them are i guess depending on where they go but i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class that has not gone to preschool or daycare and she said it takes that kid up till christmas to catch up with the things the other kids come in already knowing that is how far behind they are used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name and your address you did not even have to write it it you just had to know how to say it and your phone number and um recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills and that was about all they expected you to play cooperatively and that is about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten they expected you to know all that plus by the time you get to first grade you are supposed to have oh and the numbers you used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them in order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred you are supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (7940/ 8002)

yeah 

Recording: (7946/ 8002) 
flowers and 

Recording: (7947/ 8002) 
you know 

Recording: (7948/ 8002) 
yeah yeah we probably eventually will do that but i am like so up in the air about what i wanna do and there is SO many things to do out there that i need to take time to think about it 

Recording: (7949/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7950/ 8002) 
yeah 

Recording: (7951/ 8002) 
well at the time when they were having a lot of trouble at school and they just wanted to get rid of some people 

Recording: (7952/ 8002) 
oh yeah almost always does not matter what um the disability is AND I do not know why this is but they used to say eight to one now they are saying more like five to one does not matter if it is a speech impediment blindness retardation cerebral palsy deafness learning you name it there is five to one more boys than there are girls and we do not know why 

Recording: (7953/ 8002) 
um 

Recording: (7954/ 8002) 
yeah now if you the the the thing you do is if you know the call sign 

Recording: (7955/ 8002) 
watertown waterbury 

Recording: (7956/ 8002) 
have you ever met somebody like that and 

Recording: (7957/ 8002) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7958/ 8002) 
his dad is a um a graduate of stanford um but he is um they they never leave there i mean that is an excellent medical school and everything but those football players they are smart they they do not they do not quit you know i mean it is amazing they they never do

yeah 

Recording: (7961/ 8002) 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the seen and the unseen i will never forget it because i recited it for god knows how many years but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits they freak out 

Recording: (7962/ 8002) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (7963/ 8002) 
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow 

Recording: (7964/ 8002) 
umhum umhum that uh it it was like i say i said she probably probably thinks the same way you know she would been here you know and having trouble with boys and everything you know when she was growing up but not probably would have could have probably would have been an ass about that kind of stuff you would think i am not how bad they were you know if they laid a hand on her of course you know but but uh um but by her being away you know then and her mom is got a cool head on her shoulders she would not let that happen unless she told me about it then she would be probably be afraid tell me that i would catch an airplane flight over there or something you know fuck the guy up or something

so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with a bigger city when you get more people there is obviously gonna be some more problems um and uh i mean that is really that is really all that i know so it is obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (7970/ 8002)

uh well yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with and it is like a form of censorship you know big brother things librarians have always had problems with that uh i i do not know it is it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (7978/ 8002)

Recording: (7979/ 8002) 
as to what the sanctuary should be like <LAUGH> so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour our choir director um arranged it to about six five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we liked the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church downtown which was where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we did not <LAUGH> maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old worship center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty and it is YEAH <LAUGH> it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle it has nothing in just it is just empty space over the over the worship center so when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all of the way to the back but if you were under this flat ceiling that is only about seven or that is only about nine or ten feet high it was dead> it was just muffled <LAUGH> and um it was terrible acoustically <LAUGH> but you know we made do with it for many years and then um and then we had the the chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is uh it is really beautiful it is a circular almost circular big uh space with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh it is it is nice <LAUGH> well you could still go it is they will not have they will not have a lot of um
