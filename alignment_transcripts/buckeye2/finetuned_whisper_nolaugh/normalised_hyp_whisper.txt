Recording: (7/ 9621) 
three three out of my four children do belong to the catholic church and then my one daughter chose living in oklahoma she is in a baptist church but she is very active within the church very active through the sunday school and 

Recording: (8/ 9621) 
right but the ones the racine are the ones that are the standards in the fields but right and but more and more of those are also available on the map but you have to subscribe to them so it is still an institutional subscription i mean that is a constant problem for the serious people everywhere and it is just it is incredible what is happened with the costs yeah i mean i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year 

Recording: (9/ 9621) 
but what what does it tell us about our people we are so naive we have got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that can be more beneficial and most of the time it is listening 

Recording: (10/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (11/ 9621) 
yeah and it makes it you know fun so you can actually see what you know you are studying these teams does you know you can go whole season you know seventeen eighteen in out and nobody is pretty much coming close to your standard and when you win all that money it is just like yeah when you lose all that money it is like that is it i dont going home but i have known people that gamble you know compulsively i mean it is like a gambler is anonymous level and i could not really get into that number one i am not the richest person in the world and number two just little money here is one thing but when you are out there spending your car insurance money on it or rent money then you got a real problem there i have seen guys do that too go down the side of the down and bet the bet the farm on one horse and would not even do anything for them 

Recording: (12/ 9621) 
i have learned a lot about cooking lately 

Recording: (13/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (14/ 9621) 
so it is trying to take my time do what i wanna do yeah 

Recording: (15/ 9621) 
i am a senior and i just started the my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (16/ 9621) 
it is it is 

Recording: (17/ 9621) 
yeah it is projected like six years to take to finish some of these projects i am real well i know we chose through georgia you usually see people working on the road there is a whole bunch of people and they are all out there working you know and you get the ohio there is that i do not know something on david david letterman had a picture of this and i think i have seen it before that big sign says your tax dollars at work you know and there is the construction guy smoking a cigarette leading up against the side kind of thing it is kind of funny 

Recording: (18/ 9621) 
it is just the way it is i guess but it is like you know she says if the mother is in the house the mother is on duty 

Recording: (19/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (20/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (21/ 9621) 
right right but at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested and and there was a lot of i have always loved to travel by car yeah it is it is fun and it is probably because of that early conditioning i have been i have been in forty eight states 

Recording: (22/ 9621) 
no it was his mom ran away as what happened 

Recording: (23/ 9621) 
oh yeah by the 

Recording: (24/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (25/ 9621) 
yeah it is curious is not it 

Recording: (26/ 9621) 
i do not know um like i said i mean it is something i basically see it almost as being the same thing as like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tired of things like that but as far as what it the effects it does to you it is no worse than anything alcohol can do to you um so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if they should actually go as far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to control drug problem wise the thing is coming in i mean i know i think it is like switzerland or somewhere like that where they legalize drugs and they basically do a government based where the government actually gives them out and the government gets the money for it um i could almost see that as being almost a good idea here i mean obviously like i said people are going to do it no matter what i mean same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on it does not matter what they have to do to it they will they will come by it um i mean i i mean i could see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to a better use of some sort if they did the same kind of thing 

Recording: (27/ 9621) 
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he is a big it too the reason is yeah so 

Recording: (28/ 9621) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spent on things and then there is a form you fill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in into doctor costs and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule either goes on the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (29/ 9621) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (30/ 9621) 
he is right 

Recording: (31/ 9621) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government telling me what to do 

Recording: (32/ 9621) 
yeah most of them think the freshman class just right along i think the freshman would be a little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to be walking around you know in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million halls around me and just stopped once and i said where is lasinby and they that way that is too far from our park 

Recording: (33/ 9621) 
and that is the way i felt about it now i am not saying that that is not a possibility but 

Recording: (34/ 9621) 
yeah well like the catalog is real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and like the catalog has like a hundred of them so that is really annoying too because then people call up with all these like things that we like do not know if we have on our computers are really really old like it is like an old style mainframe 

Recording: (35/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 9621) 
i tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (37/ 9621) 
oh i yeah exactly i was just wondering how could i get a job doing what you are doing 

Recording: (38/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (39/ 9621) 
or take me to court again you know they got the money i do not 

Recording: (40/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (41/ 9621) 
yes she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (42/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (43/ 9621) 
actually i was not even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up and i said ooh sounds cool you know i had thought of myself as a uh chemist for a long time and but then this came up here and so i mean it is just ridiculously cheaper here i did not want that after under that is just pathetic um my camping just kind of found it and he had posted it and he especially um tried to notify the national mayor people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other one is like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princeton right now you know they are all off of their ivy leagues like basically working their butts off to get in when i am already in i do not totally understand it 

Recording: (44/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (45/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (46/ 9621) 
uh it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere in mit my so they are all over uh they have projects all over 

Recording: (47/ 9621) 
she just wants to get it over with 

Recording: (48/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (49/ 9621) 
yeah it is seventy years old 

Recording: (50/ 9621) 
and they are not accurate 

Recording: (51/ 9621) 
i know i i do not want to go i do not want to touch the computer when i get home 

Recording: (52/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (53/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is it is jose columbus it is jose columbus uh maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here um do not realize how it is i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not there is a lot of places it is not but it is mean you know all this oh we will never be a major league city until we have major league sports is not it well you know i guess uh getting out more would not help those people it is um uh that that would be the you know that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and um i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i i i really do think people are taking advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (54/ 9621) 
really uh-huh i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (55/ 9621) 
so she is very limited on working in clothes corners and stuff like that uh so she is basically disabled and that goes when they do that it is because of your education and also they take into consideration everything 

Recording: (56/ 9621) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room to all myself you know i do not want to go to some place where i am going to have to like deal with something else so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once i got home 

Recording: (57/ 9621) 
i never learned math we had in our fifth grade we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables you know big pizza party planned for 

Recording: (58/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (59/ 9621) 
umwell number one i did not realize that it was as big as it is until i started working for the career service you know i have heard people say and i know it is true that columbia is one of the top ten largest cities in the united states and i was like you are kidding me really i started driving around and i am like yeah it is it is like huge places absolutely beaimous i mean everything within two seventy it is it is pretty darn big and um that was really surprising um i love i just love living in a big city uh it is just it is just everything is so different than living in the country you mean i miss the big expands of grass out in the country but i can ski all over the place here in town which i can not do at home i mean i could ski down our driveway but it stops in brooklyn in stones so it gets real boring i mean going down hill is really fun but going back up is painting an neck but um uh there is a lot more people here i i like lots of people i have discovered i like having lots of people around meeting all sorts of new and interesting and unique people and every year there is a whole new crowd of freshman that come in and it it is pretty cool yep yep i do not know if i will stay here i know i would not raise a family here but no i mean ashland is the perfect place to raise a family and but that is about it and i mean i do not even know how any of the ashland has ashland university it is one of the it is got one of the best thealaskin seminars in the us and it is a republican think thing think thing it is a republican think tank so aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural i do not know i do not know why anybody would want to live there unless they are raising a family because if they are raising a family it is a great place great community great all around for raising a family oh no i wanna find a i wanna find a some place similar to that i wanna find some place in a lot in colorado yeah i love colorado it is a beautiful state i think is skiing yeah skating skiing so i did this tore my acl two years ago christmas day after christmas so tending that tending right uh right in the front of your knee that keeps yeah it keeps your it keeps it keeps your knee from moving out and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous twisting and turning positions that it is not really supposed to but i rip that right in half well what i do in a real climates well for one this place is dirty it is crap it is it is just so 

Recording: (60/ 9621) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home 

Recording: (61/ 9621) 
yeah ellen that lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky to run across her 

Recording: (62/ 9621) 
it does 

Recording: (63/ 9621) 
and he could not have any kind of caffeine otherwise he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (64/ 9621) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (65/ 9621) 
um i think some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different i mean i still go through that i think we all go through that at some point or other even yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind eye i think that is part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrong doing and your child dies you need to really admit it um i mean you do not want to do that but 

Recording: (66/ 9621) 
no i am i am interested 

Recording: (67/ 9621) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than have to wait till they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (68/ 9621) 
and this one is going to kill you to die so 

Recording: (69/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (70/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (71/ 9621) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal would like you you say you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mrs you know she is like you know the average student uh she is the type you know that she is going to get you know she is got going to get through college you know she is just one of those you know that just moves right along you know she is not the brightest you know but she is bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today and i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter you know i just want somebody to you know jerk her down 

Recording: (72/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (73/ 9621) 
they had to and they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay while i said yes but then uh uh when it got into two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a substitute substitute i am getting sixty dollars a day i can not do this enough you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am sorry i mean if i if it was my own job i would have struggled with it but it was not my own job and i did not know what was gonna happen so if they would have gotten some help in there for me i would have stayed perhaps but no i i you know you can work for under pay and under staff and every you just can not do everything so 

Recording: (74/ 9621) 
uh frightening her and stuff like that and uh of course all i would have to do is get on the phone as it turns say you know i can be out there in about two hours you know so i do not know what the problem is but you need to get you need to talk to me about talking more about it goes to somebody else and talk to them about it 

Recording: (75/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (76/ 9621) 
and decide to go back for their jobs if you notice the first time that they voted they voted down the proposal the proposal that they are voting on this week is the exact same one 

Recording: (77/ 9621) 
and i am just using that as a thing you know i mean your other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (78/ 9621) 
they could do it and my my one granddaughter uh they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to kindergarten only a half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper watching the news she told me a story about christopher columbus uh discovering america that was so deep and intense i could not believe it was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (79/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (80/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (81/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (82/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (83/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (84/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (85/ 9621) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home uh my dad uh had to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities and uh she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (86/ 9621) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people have are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in columbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they are from the south or something like that so they and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely be meet people born and raised in columbus so 

Recording: (87/ 9621) 
oh okay that was easy 

Recording: (88/ 9621) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (89/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (90/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 9621) 
you know so basically oh yeah my work but to me it is kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but to hell with all the other laws so that really fair 

Recording: (92/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (93/ 9621) 
so is that right 

Recording: (94/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (96/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (97/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (98/ 9621) 
um he he uses subcontractor if uh someone is got a job to do at their house he he will do it you know like we we just went and toward the cabins out of a a house that was on fire and because the smoke damage 

Recording: (99/ 9621) 
the hours with because usually we are starting the day too so it will probably work out pretty well for us 

Recording: (100/ 9621) 
all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on except the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that 

Recording: (101/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (102/ 9621) 
boy that is a that is a really tough one i had not i had not thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touchy about sexual identity and and so likely you know so insecure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a has a different orientation and i i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (103/ 9621) 
i went to uh uh the just about just a little uh easter here in high school 

Recording: (104/ 9621) 
he works in a factory 

Recording: (105/ 9621) 
uh all those years after i left it to school here was that the bureau of employment services i were trying to uh twenty years with uh research and statistics labor market information uh federal state programs collecting information on three different programs in that time then i worked for about a year and a half on a special project uh they were automating the employment services activities and they were going to complete different directions and match job needs of employers and applicants uh to get more basements for interviews and this sort of thing and i developed that method the the mechanism the checkless and stuff i did worked on that uh and i worked for the last three years in jobs training uh for economically disadvantage the youth do not just look at workers 

Recording: (106/ 9621) 
and one of them they looked at in columbus was uh how well he was doing in school well children you have the high one of the high stricter out rates in schools and they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money so my my feeling is you know there is a lot of programs in school that is sponsored by the federal government particularly uh to help through the students are that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (107/ 9621) 
when they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars that will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it 

Recording: (108/ 9621) 
that is fine my husband does but i kind of sleep between them when they are but right now i have because we have early on we took our bed down and just kind of had like the bench or something the box spring on the floor and i have got like comforters on the side of the bed so because he is like he will like get out he is just like i do not want to be in the bed with these guys and he will get on the floor and he will sleep on the comforters on the floor but he is close and he is happy that wayuhhuh 

Recording: (109/ 9621) 
yes hopefully 

Recording: (110/ 9621) 
you have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemisphere is pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs a show well then that is when those reverseals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture so hm 

Recording: (111/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (113/ 9621) 
i travel has been all i i even before the transition time i travel across the state and country and before that was always traveling we took two two weeks off when we got back to fall semester that time of semester is not quarters and uh uh we would get on a anyhow bus for our past was and but then i would just travel all over the country and sleep in the bus at night 

Recording: (114/ 9621) 
and it is it is wild it just seems like the music has not gone anywhere because they keep going back to the seventy you know the rolling stones go to her or pink floyd or you know these are groups from back then where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people they are not there you know and the quality of the music just must not be there my daughter is into the brittany sphere and the um uh uh back street boys in sink all this and now we are starting to get into some of that that is starting to get a little interesting too as far as music choices and wanting to live yeah get them the sonny walkman and and you do not have to listen to it they did not have that one we were kids for oh i remember our car had an kids from i remember our car had an am radio and that was it yeah yeah yeah on an album and now the kids are like i want the cd put the cd in yeah yeah 

Recording: (115/ 9621) 
they in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents so i did that until i uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years and then they relocated to dallas so yeah 

Recording: (116/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (117/ 9621) 
yeah and it is like number one in the union and that is like a such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone is life and be like oh our bad that person was innocent you know 

Recording: (118/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (119/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (120/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (121/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (122/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (123/ 9621) 
and why what he he is too busy 

Recording: (124/ 9621) 
that is what 

Recording: (125/ 9621) 
you know ai not the way and hell you would have one nowadays 

Recording: (126/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (127/ 9621) 
one of the he has the most experience 

Recording: (128/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (129/ 9621) 
because you know they they bypass me and street mom mom mom you know 

Recording: (130/ 9621) 
uh yeah my parents live in akron uh like north of akron kind of falls area but like i said i my i had an apartment down there and but like for the summer i am down here so i am a transient always moving my stuff 

Recording: (131/ 9621) 
you know decide where you are going why do you just waste all your time running around like that 

Recording: (132/ 9621) 
so he did it it well he is always had some problems his uh his problems being focused on things unless it is something he is extremely interested in then you can get him away from it um if it is something he it is just an example in school he would sit there and he would be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they are trying to teach something in class or so working on a writing assignments or something they had a half hour to work on it he would for the last five minutes the teacher say you know you really need to get that down he sat down and write it in the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and he could do it that quickly um i think he is lost ground on that now but and that was just an example in the second grade that this school he went to was an open classroom and uh he had been through some couple of traditional schools already and the principals said we had told the talk to the principal about the problems we are having with it saying focus and she said well we can work with that well about halfway through the year she said it is not working and they have an arrangement with and i doubt if most of the people in the parents in the school are even where this with children is hospital counseling so they set a room aside and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students they it is open classroom it is experimental since people come in and going all the time and we were never aware of it i i doubt most of the people are aware of it and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him and he was they were the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about it they said he was the counselor said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but if it came time to answer the questions he knew every answer she said he they they decided not to precede at that time because this is frustrating too it was a wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for a wedding anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week that was unusual and he was not a bad kid 

Recording: (133/ 9621)

you will you will know it is made by a 

Recording: (138/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (139/ 9621) 
yeah and a lot of them is been getting off the hook latelybecause he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions now i think that there is there is uh things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide you know wider version of what they i do not know what they call it it is in that magazine there is what triggers the violence and violent thoughts people actually do think more about the violence when they commit it and the accidental you know some of it is mindless some of it is not but everybody thinks 

Recording: (140/ 9621) 
professors yeah well i as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i am a one of fifteen siblings 

Recording: (141/ 9621) 
it is a great experience it really it even when you know we were having problems with him and stuff it was great uh he could not understand you know my wife once said tony says you know something about spending time together she she said that there is no time that we spend with you that is wasted and he could not understand that she said you mean this is fun i said it was fun 

Recording: (142/ 9621)

Recording: (160/ 9621) 
you are adopted by two dads i mean i mean that is a lot it is it is difficult to adopt children i mean and it should be and so the children they would likely take would be trouble to begin with 

Recording: (161/ 9621)

Recording: (172/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (173/ 9621) 
where where you are usually from 

Recording: (174/ 9621) 
because that is like me i watch three students and you do not see me putting a crew bar up nobody is nose 

Recording: (175/ 9621) 
right right that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible montst robity developments and still be able to findhum 

Recording: (176/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (177/ 9621) 
i come back and it you know 

Recording: (178/ 9621) 
and those the the other students are lost to the system and that is what happened with him 

Recording: (179/ 9621) 
even republicans were like that 

Recording: (180/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah because i could not imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (181/ 9621) 
um i got into painting somewhat recently uh i have always done a lot of art uh my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to art as a child uh did pretty good too but i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing and just uh you know three or four years ago i thought i am going to learn how to paint and i learned how to paint 

Recording: (182/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (183/ 9621) 
yeah i have read that i need to try that just for winter even 

Recording: (184/ 9621) 
oh yeah that was a that was a job helping them to move 

Recording: (185/ 9621) 
well yeah under certain 

Recording: (186/ 9621) 
no no but that is what i am saying but that that is what i am saying and the same thing that is happening when we had a busting we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment oh they they got the taste of it and they went back home oh yeah um and we did an uh very unjust thing to those kids into the families and then when we broke them up we did something else you know take them out we lost that community involvement so now the parents can not follow kids their activities uh getting it is putting it up hey we do not want to we do not want to have families that is a misnoma they said the the community raises the family the kids yeah that is how they want you to think but the the community will not remember if place the family 

Recording: (187/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (188/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (189/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (190/ 9621) 
yeah see i hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced like one matter 

Recording: (191/ 9621) 
well and 

Recording: (192/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (193/ 9621) 
the way i feel 

Recording: (194/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (195/ 9621) 
right after high school i think there was probably i will say six and amazingly uh well three were still together 

Recording: (196/ 9621) 
are they but they all look alike 

Recording: (197/ 9621) 
no no but 

Recording: (198/ 9621) 
yeah and we just had a van who took time to 

Recording: (199/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (200/ 9621) 
um that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (201/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (202/ 9621) 
that is true 

Recording: (203/ 9621) 
um they uh stopped federalway funding uh oh it is you that was the federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people moved like to arizona and california and and i thought well since they only have like two and a half years until i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to uproot my daughters out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to poor columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (204/ 9621) 
so i guess i mean that went that was really really hard for me i would just call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what the child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crime spell but he did go who that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (205/ 9621) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (206/ 9621) 
take the ferry from southeast london 

Recording: (207/ 9621) 
city council of dayton and had highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line and should have gone to columbia at the same time interesting 

Recording: (208/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (209/ 9621) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (210/ 9621) 
my dad seems to think is she going to law because there is law and everything you can do anything with a law degree 

Recording: (211/ 9621) 
well personally i voted that the thirty three should pass i think they should the way i understood i mean they have ways of wording those things you have to read it very carefully to know whether you say yes or no one thing i suggest because i uh organized it to say that they are repealing something that was passed i think uh one or two years ago that was allowing things to be done up around the police area like new roads and this and that and i want that repealed because i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things 

Recording: (212/ 9621) 
oh my god 

Recording: (213/ 9621) 
they are just like it a little less or dislike it a little more when when it looks like it is gonna come to something it looks like they are it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience and i i that is not something i would feel teased by particularly 

Recording: (214/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (215/ 9621) 
kind 

Recording: (216/ 9621) 
can even think about asking 

Recording: (217/ 9621) 
yeah i i thought in the beginning i missed mary lake cafe is so bad you have the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i missed them i do not i go back and though i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (218/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (219/ 9621) 
whenever he run well i thought he was going to be elected uh mayor two but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but um uh you know he is got his constituents and they are going to reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes a mistake is say labeled things races that are not necessarily races but anyway 

Recording: (220/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (221/ 9621) 
yeah it is just like uh having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicted it could screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors 

Recording: (222/ 9621) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because your black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same thing with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does the stuff for them i mean i can not say it being any 

Recording: (223/ 9621) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus with the internet and everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (224/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (225/ 9621) 
um in general i think i think the united states has a fairly well developed like not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (226/ 9621) 
yeah and 

Recording: (227/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (228/ 9621) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (229/ 9621) 
um up until march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home and then my grandfather who is ninety five got um ill and my aunt had to choose between my son and my grandfather and um she is watching actually my grandfather is doing quite well now but she um watched him so we now have him in a day care um and now we are 

Recording: (230/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (231/ 9621) 
well you have seen people driving the wrong way on the freeway right 

Recording: (232/ 9621) 
but you know and years ago it was kind of funny we seen him seen each other and everything and uh and that uh some place down in indiana and saturday night the term went amher that time i said yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (233/ 9621)

uh-huh 

Recording: (242/ 9621) 
is it 

Recording: (243/ 9621) 
she is pretty nice i mean she is definitely at least standable and 

Recording: (244/ 9621) 
and then like let us see a lot of it was i mean most of it was was like pre labor and then there was the breathing that we did at the yeah but other than the video it was mostly like labor related 

Recording: (245/ 9621) 
to tell how how nineteen eighteen year old people are on the phone it is really funny compared to it is funny too when when you can tell it is kind of like what what people all his backgrounds are and what what what kind of like their job is just by their by their like how they conduct themselves on the phone and people you know especially when people who can tell when they have been in the military like they say like allaw probably something like that for the for the letters like they spell everything out and they say like like out for zero sometimes have people doing it like yes sir no sir uh or um just uh when people a lot of people call from new york who are arab or and they are like uh those people are so aggravating they are like i do not know what this if i i have on just i have i saw stereo in in store i like and it is like man i do not know what you are saying like and um it is real funny too when uh like oh yeah like when when they are in new york and it is all real loud and there is like cars and sirens in the background and stuff or when people um you know this lady asked me she was like did she was telling me about she was getting like some bedroom set or something like that like some sheets or something and she was like asking me if it would go with her wallpaper and stuff and she was like she was like a a describing it to me like i this has a green trim with like a flowers design and she is like do you think this is like blue will accent it or something and i am like yeah sure it would have been 

Recording: (246/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (247/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (248/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum well i have i have two uncles that are southern baptist ministeristers and used to be when we would visit them in the mid sixties we would have to go i mean if you visit your if your relatives visit and your minister you would have to go to church and uh but the thing is is southern baptist uh service always has that period where you are 

Recording: (249/ 9621) 
i i do not think so in new york it might be i am like i say it is a lot more competitive there here i think i think columbus is in the midwest in general i think is much more open 

Recording: (250/ 9621) 
yeah there is uh some people there just get lazy and then you got the college students they i do not know how many of them work but most of them there is just from out of town 

Recording: (251/ 9621) 
no it is just uh regular old rent a cop with his own van he hop in i will give you a ride and drove me to the corner of the middle and know where important to where i live and then i had to walk all the way home 

Recording: (252/ 9621) 
um one of the requirements is we have to be in the honor is college during undergraduate only uh fulfill all the requirements there 

Recording: (253/ 9621) 
i never thought he was any better than anybody else you know he was always there to to help out if he could you know but then some people would not say uh some people were not that way 

Recording: (254/ 9621) 
oh yeah they were more settled 

Recording: (255/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they are pretty good where i live uh well last year when we had that really really high snow um i shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over so i was like what is the point um but our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk 

Recording: (256/ 9621) 
she believes no man will love you so much not to cheat and i do not believe that so i am not with her son 

Recording: (257/ 9621) 
they are not 

Recording: (258/ 9621) 
i i knew that kindergarten because it is it is not required in the state of ohio anyway they really are not required to be in school and a role in anything until they are six by september when i found that i was like oh okay cool you know keep him home i mean he is he could probably go into the second grade i mean he is very bright he can read and write and add and he he you know he is so it is a challenge for me 

Recording: (259/ 9621) 
so i am not going to get any fairness or justice out of that but uh so they sent me their words saying that they signed it in their favor and all that crap well you know fine um but i am not going to i am not gonna i am not gonna pay them till they contact me again 

Recording: (260/ 9621) 
it is funny because i had studied russian but a lot of the people i have served with were blue and spanish or something else so it is like i do not know why they got sent there but it is i i mean we have really believed that there that it is inspired they send our your name in a picture and your application to the profit who is the head of the church and um they pray over it and they decide where you go 

Recording: (261/ 9621) 
yeah right yeah we could put a little trailer there we would be outside most of the time anyway so 

Recording: (262/ 9621) 
and i do not matter what they are 

Recording: (263/ 9621) 
uh it is not really an office he is like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites he he tells the the crew members what house was to work on and which ones are ready and and then he gets to uh talk with the the other contractors and he works together with them but he is really just there is a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites 

Recording: (264/ 9621) 
i do not know she is getting a second child now and it is getting a little harder 

Recording: (265/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (266/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (267/ 9621) 
i just hope he stays around i i i do not know maybe not but i grew up without a father and i really um have that against my father because he lived around us he never caught us you know and i really got resentment against him 

Recording: (268/ 9621) 
yeah you you can not have a beer gun and a big ass and it means you are it means you are sloppy and lazy if you do but if a man does it is like my god he is probably got some power behind him and it is like yeah he is probably just as lazy as anybody else it is like you know uh you know i hate to see girls starve of themselves to death you know it is like uh you know there are certain times in your life where you are going to be fat you know you know my my youngest daughter has a problem with that you know she is i do not know why she is so insecure because she out of the four of us including her sister is like you know right at the top i mean she has done television commercials she is done radio voice over she is been in plays and she was in a high school play when she was a uh uh kindergarten student and actually i am speaking part and i am sitting there in the audience like in tears because and i i am like why am i crying but it is like you know how can she do this and you know like you see her i saw her on a few tv commercials and i am like i tried to do that and if you can picture driving along the highway at night with your bright lights on it and you are doing this that is about how good i am in those and she is just like you know and she is she is not as smart a house you know she does not show off but she is just so relaxed doing this and it is it looks so natural but she does not see that because you know you know she always thinks she is very uh mediocre and i go but you know i said you know you have been in front of television cameras and you do so well i said you get on the radio you do well i said you do well in school you have a ton of friends i said you have a great body i said you know i said i never compare the two of them but at there are sometimes when i have to i said look at your sister she has the same chest i do i said you definitely are well built there i said you have a nice shape i said when you have a bathing suit on it is like i go somebody put a towel on her you know and i said you know you just do not realize all the physical and and also the character attitudes you have i said you have a great person and i said you go in a room of a hundred people with me and your sister and about three days later somebody will go john and jilina who but in ten minutes they will go where is janella because they all know you you are just so easy to get along with and everybody likes you and i said you just do not realize this gigantic list of character physical and mental treats you have that i can never even come close to having 

Recording: (269/ 9621) 
you know that is not because i am skilled or anything it is because well when i was a kid my dad was crippled i had to fix everything so 

Recording: (270/ 9621) 
but um and he is limited his meat a little bit more but with men it is a lot harder i think you know when there is used to you mean potato kind of families um but like thanksgiving it just does not mean that much to me i the family thing goes but you know the turkey we i do not cook it very often my sister we used to get my sisters 

Recording: (271/ 9621) 
you are like i am on the pay you know for cats you like honey it is just a cat you know it is my you can come home and visit it anytime i pay you know all right 

Recording: (272/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (273/ 9621) 
yeah there there times when you know just there is a uh group over there called star trek 

Recording: (274/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (275/ 9621) 
would you do uh like oh god you know i feel like i was a parent before i was a parent you know i that is the way it felt it was like some of my friends like like this guy i used to hang up with he he is the run into walkers in high school and like that is so good 

Recording: (276/ 9621) 
and that type of person i do not think would make a very effective president because i do not know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet 

Recording: (277/ 9621) 
uh it is been should pretty it is uh yeah you know you are not around here is it it is a it is a classic school over on the west side 

Recording: (278/ 9621) 
yeah i somebody is got to get get you know put george bush to the back 

Recording: (279/ 9621) 
yeah that is 

Recording: (280/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (281/ 9621) 
um i i think it fills it is niche you know i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a niche and um i think it fills it very well 

Recording: (282/ 9621) 
that so that if you if whoever won you know would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time it might be better now 

Recording: (283/ 9621) 
he is going to he is going to be there all summer yeah i did not decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner um and found out that when i checked the web site for the scaner that they are just simply flat out not making one to two thousand drivers from my scanter so it is a uh crap i do not know i just got it i can not even remember what it is um paperport i think it is paperport a good one to a thousand that all costs stick with ninety eight much better much better operating system 

Recording: (284/ 9621) 
you do not go into elementary ed that much 

Recording: (285/ 9621) 
well i i enjoy this but it it will be impersonal uh because here you are i am not can not face you i do not know whether you are really kidding me and what you are talking about sitting there in that in that uh street cafe or not but i really do think we are going to be interconnected in that sense and and and it it becomes you so much more impersonal i guess i am very strong about the term personal versus impersonal in any communications uhand the bad that we have talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now but i think we will have a gun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will uh going back to the political question i think the financial things well i think think we will start we will start slowing that down now i think we will have less influence in in the terms of finances i do not think we will get back to abraham lincoln days but uh if we can swing that pendulum back uh i think we i think we can i think we will i think we can do the same thing with communications uh i i think we can eliminate a lot of the uh bad bad influences i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here it is sort of like the definition of need versus luxury uh in other words definition definition change the definition of socialism democracy as slowly have changed over these times well the same thing will true be true with those it is still functioning excuse me um and i think we are also slowly swing our things am on back to the and to the family again there are those dumps there from my point of view are saying that uh in in many years to come there will not be such a thing as a family uh it is just you you go out here you meet a an opposite sex you pro due and you go on your way she goes on her way and she is just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way um it yes a lot of that is true but i think that uh i think i do not think that is going to ever happen i think we will turn that thing around i think the so cold divorce rate program was i talked about a while ago that uh every or fifty percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together i think that will will change and that is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

Recording: (286/ 9621) 
i feel like i should just stand out there give it money because my bills are getting me high 

Recording: (287/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (288/ 9621) 
and that is where i am ready to go back through all that 

Recording: (289/ 9621) 
after for the whole day which would be considered church so they said i what i had to do was go down to juvenile to the certain gentleman and juvenile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was a school should have did that so in the meantime he is telling me that my son is getting ready to go to eleventh grade and neither side is going to do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and uh so he knew he could get by with it 

Recording: (290/ 9621) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not wait to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family in fact i have been real uh happy about them lately because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my parents they they live in florida they um i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california twice a year to spend a week with my brother et cetera et cetera and they come here a couple times a year and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times in twenty years and that is because they do not want to get off the freeway they will drive through columbus from florida to go to visit people in in akron and massland and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in spring field with my sisters and they will not do it because it is just too they do not want to have to deal with that traffic they do not like that and it is and just recently i finally said you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually called them up i am fifty two 

Recording: (291/ 9621) 
i would say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know but not i do not think that you can say everything you know you have everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (292/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (293/ 9621) 
yeah it was 

Recording: (294/ 9621) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorce statistics have been recently but i do see that more people who are getting married or staying married because those that do not those that would have gotten the divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and that they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (295/ 9621) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (296/ 9621) 
you know white napkins and you know we would go there for lunch you know you dress nice and uh you know i i like that and i would uh like you know my grandkids to be to go downtown with me like that you know rather than have to drive off to a mall 

Recording: (297/ 9621) 
yeah that part was no different i mean 

Recording: (298/ 9621) 
they had a tuba for on the door for over a month 

Recording: (299/ 9621) 
no that that would go over a while here would not it 

Recording: (300/ 9621) 
so they are called 

Recording: (301/ 9621) 
i mean he would have he would have been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there and uh while while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh oh i mean it was it is a hilarious story i mean thirty foot moving truck i am sleeping in it and i get uh 

Recording: (302/ 9621) 
now who does he work for 

Recording: (303/ 9621) 
and some of that is controlled with medication now but not all of it because of because of the drug and alcohol they will not put him on some of the medications so but as far as i can tell he is been pretty clear and clean on that and uh you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taken very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to the psychologist and uh uh we have been paying for him but we do not have a problem with that because he is smoking he likes the psychologist so it took a long time to get to that point but uh so we have been talking to the psychologist about it and they said she he said most people that raised in that background he said they go to different ways ones they they just fall into the same uh pattern as the parents or their survival and she appears to be a survival um she is never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us uh which i am glad uh and she we really like her she is really uh we enjoy being with her but sometimes we go to being with my son uh 

Recording: (304/ 9621) 
so i i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk 

Recording: (305/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (306/ 9621) 
and just took it and ripped it 

Recording: (307/ 9621) 
oh it is possible but i can not imagine it would uh i not knowing how big it is going to get i guess i can not imagine 

Recording: (308/ 9621) 
i dont know 

Recording: (309/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (310/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (311/ 9621) 
it is down the hill kind of by the horse yeah yeah so that is where we go and i do not have a student idea so i just sneak in but it is the summer they do not even care they never 

Recording: (312/ 9621) 
i think i think they should um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation that you can be converted to homosexuality and i personally do not believe that so it i you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this comes comes from but since i think they are wrong i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it is you know dealt with in a common reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (313/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i heard something about that 

Recording: (314/ 9621) 
i retired about uh four years ago from this state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i was in school here i worked here and that counteded us five years kind of towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then uh last uh about the last two and a half years i have been working at the symphony in the box office started part time and then i was full time for a while and then i requested to be cut back to parttime even because uh 

Recording: (315/ 9621) 
i am i am going to keep doing the same stuff you know i will find some other kids somewhere else and i will have some time you know my husband and i will have time together and i i always find some i always have a project you know it is like i am always saying well when things slow down around here and get it like right now it should be home counting money for the i i do the fund raiser for the the school and we raise um we just sell more than candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff and our sale door where from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that same myself but that also means that i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile so but any how more saying when it slows down but then i always will find another project so and i rehab houses whenever i get a chance i like to do that so 

Recording: (316/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (317/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (318/ 9621) 
okay does is it like a kind of snobish or are you 

Recording: (319/ 9621) 
i i am not really a big fan uh i think one of the big problems is going to be uh uh initially just the uh uh the monitor thing of it you know the people that supported the uh basically supported the uh uh minor league teams that they had here you know with like blue collar people with a you can go for twenty thirty bucks and have a good time get drunk to beer and and up there you know you are not going to be able to do that it is going to cost you uh and you know fifty to a hundred dollars probably to take a family couple kids or something like that you know 

Recording: (320/ 9621) 
or anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sort of make known to them but not something that would really push on them 

Recording: (321/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (322/ 9621) 
actually i that is what got me interested in when i went to library school and 

Recording: (323/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (324/ 9621) 
yeah he he loves some chicken and he loves chicken that is like his favorite food but 

Recording: (325/ 9621) 
since i have been on both worlds 

Recording: (326/ 9621) 
it was not public science to the to agree that it is now it seems like anymore nothing is secret i mean as far as papers are concerned and uh there is something else that i i guess i am a old fashioned but i do not think we need all this publicity about all the sexual escapades of all the people that are notorious or have notorious lives uhuh they just uh i would say maybe i am old fashioned but i and they i can hardly conceive anyone being a genuine homosexual i mean evidently they are but uh it is so against human nature i think or against conventional human nature anyway 

Recording: (327/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 9621) 
she helped a lot 

Recording: (329/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (330/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (331/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (332/ 9621) 
it is regular is enough for me in that and i did not have i could not schedule the owners 

Recording: (333/ 9621) 
we took um or i took uh military athletics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that iraqi there is still certain contacts within the contacts of war for instance if if we both know if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we we are fighting for whatever it costs but if we both are willingness going into it 

Recording: (334/ 9621) 
no every once in a while with my grandmother she always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school and she died and sometimes i think boy she really like it that i was a nurse because i still use her blood pressure cup and everything she had given me her blood pressure cup i mean that is very old 

Recording: (335/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (337/ 9621) 
yeah my grandmother is from ireland my grandmother and grandfather both from ireland 

Recording: (338/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (339/ 9621) 
yeah but i mean you know a kid that you know might want to save up or something when he is twelve years old has no chance at all of getting a job 

Recording: (340/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (341/ 9621) 
well that is the other thing there a lot of times they are good in the arts they are either an artist i have a boy right now that is an eighth grader that is painting a huge canvas for me for my living room because i have not been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture and he is enlarging it and painting it for me in his free time and it is going to go in my living room and i mean it is it is i mean he is really quite the artist and music arts um literature acting i have had kids that have been like really top notch actors in the school plays it is it is just not necessarily a school kind of thing that they are good at but i try to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently has no reason to think they will not be successful in life mark spitts when a olympic gold metal he has a learning disability cheryb ono can not remember a phone number without transmosing two of the numbers and she says that herself um einstein did not learn to read until he was twelve um winston churchill he studied until he was like seven or eight uh walt disney was told by a manager at woolworth that he would never have a creative idea in his life 

Recording: (342/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (343/ 9621) 
um i it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it you know we are very strict as far as what games they have no you know it is so wild you know when we were kids cowboy and indians everybody had guns everybody you know if you had the best death act you were the best you know and nowadays oh do not let him have a gun you know do not let him play with the you know even a squirt gun you know and so you wonder whether it is over exaggerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or this you know we do not own it fire i am we played with guns and played cow all these games and so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (344/ 9621) 
you know they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland colorado all those school shootings and can not believe i mean i mean there is articles in there you would not even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (345/ 9621) 
most of my friends 

Recording: (346/ 9621) 
um-hum and they should and very rarely do doctors even ask about allergies and i more and more and people do not even realize and they get sick so often they need to ask about allergies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out what is wrong with them because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they have eaten and 

Recording: (347/ 9621) 
so like uh there is like a is there a large american population and say well i think i just well i just you know like you know yeah it is like cosby is father but sometimes you know just want to hang out with with your own so is you know do you have is there any problems just buying you know people from states 

Recording: (348/ 9621) 
there are a lot of teams that we are cutting that much weight if not more they were pretty much doing it for the team 

Recording: (349/ 9621) 
yeah frankly in county usually votes differently than the rest of at least the metropolitan areas of the state 

Recording: (350/ 9621) 
so i started working when i was fourteen i have been working ever since i have been out of school since i was sixteen so i was in the service i was in vietnam

yeah but i have i have never voted in the primary my son said that uh i need to but i am not real interested in voting in the primary 

Recording: (355/ 9621) 
and then there is the one that is like oh yes i had duke is off at christmas well i used to work at hurting hospital as a teacher when um i first went to worthyton when i said i got another job i got a job working at hurting hospital as the i was a principal but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day and i was also the administrator because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescents unit and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credits somewhere so the doctors always used to we were on the like each person would be on a team of these kids would be assigned to these kids and you would go to your team meetings and the doctors the shrinks would go oh i mean hang on t week is off at christmas you know they would be be bitching in the moment about the fact that that we got time off and they did not and i finally came up with the perfect thing one time i said well doctor simpson or whatever his name was doctor brown you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off 

Recording: (356/ 9621) 
um aids being one of them 

Recording: (357/ 9621) 
that is the afternoon yeah okay i have now dover and a ferry what else do i need to remember 

Recording: (358/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (359/ 9621) 
so that is mainly probably more for fishing 

Recording: (360/ 9621) 
do i think they will oh yes i think they definitely will i think there is so much heavy uh political and financial well i am a reverse that statement uh there is so much heavy financial influence upon the political uh influence that it is it is almost a four going conclusion and if it does not occur this within this year and uh there may be another vote in another year or next uh next election but i think that in fact it will go 

Recording: (361/ 9621) 
sometimes she and mary had more disagreements than i have or had with her 

Recording: (362/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (363/ 9621) 
well the humans has started it and the man narrating the thing said there was not a single animal that they profileed in the thing that uh um behaved the way it did on its own accord 

Recording: (364/ 9621) 
yeah i think it is of course we were fiddling with that so much 

Recording: (365/ 9621) 
no i do not want them to get together i love the tension if they get together it is dead whenever they get uh well i have seen you there are like five or six examples where it looks like they are going to hook out i mean that one where there was like uh a a the duplicate mall there 

Recording: (366/ 9621) 
um actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

Recording: (367/ 9621) 
well i do not think growing up we did not we it was not really called sex ed um they talked about the female productive system nothing about men which is kind of funny you know it was always the women and not charts you know 

Recording: (368/ 9621) 
she said you know what they say now and i raised my hand and said six she said fourth 

Recording: (369/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (370/ 9621) 
it makes me angry that people like that even get money 

Recording: (371/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (372/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (373/ 9621) 
so i was shut out of the job market then you know and that did not bother me i thought well fine i went that is when i got the job of channel four but uh it is like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad 

Recording: (374/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (375/ 9621) 
here less this means i get to hear more of my book 

Recording: (376/ 9621) 
i go the same k at myr would have been like seven dollars or something like that and you know but uh you know i am i do not try to be the that cheapscale i mean i would go without health plan or anything like that but you know there are certain like my car i love cars and you know you take the car to car and watch it is like seven fifty or eight bucks and you watch it on the driveway and it is about a quarter you know it is like it takes time if you if you have no time and you know i i have friends at work that they are the mom is a taxi cab driver and the dad is the worker be and when they get home they do not want to do anything so they pay that out of the yard done they they do this and other that and it is like they have and they always go we have no money and it is like because you pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know it is it is like you are making your soup you know when if and when you have children when they get my age they are going to go i can remember walking around the house and going mom was making bean soup or mom is making vegetable soup or mom baked a cake it is like as opposed to opening up oh here is a wire cake you know 

Recording: (377/ 9621) 
that is all right yeah 

Recording: (378/ 9621) 
and they are real hyper about like you know bad thing for people to do you know that that during getting the smoking there is not as strict about it basically 

Recording: (379/ 9621) 
now like i say i do not i do not believe that homosexuality is taught um i think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be just fine 

Recording: (380/ 9621) 
uh where we put all kinds of information out on our own web site which there is so much it is very hard to find what you want you know it is it is that is a constant problem with information is the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want but if you can not get to it if it is not out there you can not find it uh it it is a problem for us for libraries because there is just a barage of what they are getting and it is not just for most it is for the literature um there is literally you know hundreds of library publications uh and it is a problem their libraries are facing all the time they can not keep up 

Recording: (381/ 9621) 
i have raised for most of my life 

Recording: (382/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (383/ 9621) 
oh interesting 

Recording: (384/ 9621) 
uh-huh uh-huh 

Recording: (385/ 9621) 
so uh they got us kids actually in time but they uh did not i mean they 

Recording: (386/ 9621) 
no and there is a bunch you go to jail for three years 

Recording: (387/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (388/ 9621) 
the other one just did not really well 

Recording: (389/ 9621) 
a little bit yeah 

Recording: (390/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (391/ 9621) 
that is perfect 

Recording: (392/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (393/ 9621) 
so i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because 

Recording: (394/ 9621) 
some embarrassed i am so sorry and the guy is like ah nobody else is eaten it she might as well 

Recording: (395/ 9621) 
which was i am let us see what those guns are of art with weird within ten ten yards was a hit was a tarp and because if you had one of those things thirty seven pounds of t n t golf within ten yards of it 

Recording: (396/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (397/ 9621) 
now well he is right now he is really interested in eastern religions i am not sure where that came from you know when they go to college and they are gone and you do not see him much uh that is what he is interested in right now so i do not think it it it it really took 

Recording: (398/ 9621) 
well he told a jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the holly cost went to hell because they were jewish 

Recording: (399/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (400/ 9621) 
because i have seen more violence on alcohol i have seen more women beat i have seen more kids beat i have seen more drunk and driving wrecks 

Recording: (401/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (402/ 9621) 
and their needs were immediate 

Recording: (403/ 9621) 
it is so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually 

Recording: (404/ 9621) 
i was going to say i i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to be at home and the husband support them and in those situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is alimony and all that kind of thing and and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know 

Recording: (405/ 9621) 
where are you from 

Recording: (406/ 9621) 
um i think the fact that things like at responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know things as far as people getting pregnant and and then this person goes off and and be them you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and it is just it is more socially acceptable to to be able to do these things now than i think it was a long time ago i mean people is families would not would not ever stand for something like that they would say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it is just it is kind of horrible and everybody just kind of goes along with it 

Recording: (407/ 9621) 
el all the kids in the world all that that would happen do that that influence all the kids 

Recording: (408/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (409/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (410/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (411/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah is it going to be fine the house we want or we will go build it some 

Recording: (412/ 9621) 
yeah i think they do 

Recording: (413/ 9621) 
not that i have seen you know 

Recording: (414/ 9621) 
well the charge was cutting class yeah and where it was i was supposed to meet my mom outside i told my teacher i brought it in guy is excuse slip and all that i went down to my locker before and the teacher we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you not a teacher but a minister excuse me and she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole thirty minute conversation that could have only lasted five minutes with thank you okay here is my slip she thought i ford is to slip 

Recording: (415/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (416/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (417/ 9621) 
i am an independent 

Recording: (418/ 9621) 
um in in trying to stop it um uh and trying to think of some good examples i mean when politicians start talking about like biological functions 

Recording: (419/ 9621) 
yeah it is a tour it is a package tour i mean i have room floor and it is a bit then it is just me say the yeah see the does not interest me 

Recording: (420/ 9621) 
exactly yeah 

Recording: (421/ 9621) 
it was a law enforcement career center and i mean 

Recording: (422/ 9621) 
well it is sort of like the sociology of like clicks you know like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like like that is a real strong uh like 

Recording: (423/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (424/ 9621) 
and how are you and i know like one point in time it is like we do not want to hang out with you crystal and like we will fine i do not care i will go hang out with them i mean it is like they they still need to do a lot of growing up 

Recording: (425/ 9621) 
uh yeah they uh near near west side is always been a pretty bad area well in the last forty or fifty years and it is starting to creep west 

Recording: (426/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (427/ 9621) 
yeah that is true we went oh it is just they have got a nice facility i mean they have a a a like a labor and delivery room it is got like it is weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this world pulled back thing with i do not know if you have heard those commercials or not but they have there is only one room that is like that 

Recording: (428/ 9621) 
and uh and that is really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because i uh i i have not said it yet but you you know anyone who is listening to the paper you would be able to know i am a democrat and generally vote democratic although i will i did vote for griglia shakha once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style and he has not been bad for the city but um i am generally a democrat uh and i have only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was going to win just by being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and uh he said something about you know and i can not remember how we got started on the topic you know just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um a dole was too old and this is a young guy he was in college and i knew there was there was a a sort of a shift people wanted someone with younger ideas and um a new vision they did not want the world war two vision anymore uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought do they really understand different in issues and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton so i think for the average voter that does have uh a lot of sway 

Recording: (429/ 9621) 
or the festivals in the summer that they have downtown i mean those are those are really great and they are you know i mean they are they are crowded but they are peaceful you know there is not there is not rioting in the streets and there is a lot to do and great you know great music 

Recording: (430/ 9621) 
really and it is a fun job it really is i i have only ever known one male that taught first grade uh i knew one guy that taught third most of the time if they go in elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six but um i really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier than they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it is not just a girlie thing they would say oh a mister so and so things that is important that i know this and he is a real macho guide so i better learn it you know i do i really do nowadays with the pay being better we are getting more men but 

Recording: (431/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (432/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (433/ 9621) 
well according to the government she would have 

Recording: (434/ 9621) 
right right you know 

Recording: (435/ 9621) 
we have not talked about adopting the baby but our age

Recording: (451/ 9621) 
then get vaccineed in time and he was just covered with those sores for i do not know how long uh mom said that after they started after the scabs started falling off um well he would get out of the bed and take the seat out in the yard and shake it to get their scabs off but uh

well that is what that is what they have done well they have done that here too they have done every university 

Recording: (455/ 9621) 
well and that that is a problem in our society and if if something can come out of the university here to promote the reverse of that i think you have a lot less psychological problems with people and domestic problems work problems everything because the problem comes down to the fact well gee it is not it is not recognized you know we are whatever these um trends in our society is said well you got to be a you got to be a computer guru you got to be the well before before gates was recognized he was nothing 

Recording: (456/ 9621)

Recording: (460/ 9621) 
and i did not do that myself but we had a couple boys in the outfield who could uh find where we were on a map and where our oh p our observation point was and where the enemy out here was and all that and uh it is uh it is it was interesting uh calculating trying to calculate where your sales were on land out there 

Recording: (461/ 9621)

Recording: (462/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (463/ 9621)

Recording: (464/ 9621) 
the bonding 

Recording: (465/ 9621) 
course i am gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go 

Recording: (466/ 9621) 
leaving out stuff man 

Recording: (467/ 9621) 
pita 

Recording: (468/ 9621) 
i mean i do not think they should get rid of it for hilarious thing but you know there is plenty of malls to go to that is the case it is not a big bill to me to tell you the truth no actually i live i live closer i live east more 

Recording: (469/ 9621) 
is that right i just i just love i love i just love those quality bears you just see a quality i would go so i just like little teddy bears bring was bringing bringing bringing one to your daughter say here he is got a little play baby is he is a he is a baby rather for you really do they oh he looks so sweet and cutlass you know it is like just like somebody you just want to take home reallyreally where do they eat 

Recording: (470/ 9621) 
well my son started uh yeah his son started public school for kindergarten and he just my son is my son is a very social child we will say he is the one that talks too much as a teacher say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i mean he needs the time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little there was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play well yeah and yeah my and my my daughter is the opposite so that uh but he would do that and so he was not he was very he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble and it is like i i do not know we would be told he was a problem but he did not understand what was going on and there there was not a structure he would go to school every day and not know what to expect because there was not like this we will do this and then we will do this and we will do this so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way and it just was a better better match for him and then but my daughter went to school it was just easier to take him to the same school and and that goes back and and it reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about my uh discipline and and behavior may be different in the catholic school is you are paying big you are paying bucks you know it is forth out forty five hundred hours a year for us to send her to school uh and if we find out she is not doing her work it is a very different perspective 

Recording: (471/ 9621) 
is really opposing my beliefs so i stand there and pretty much star with them about it and usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave 

Recording: (472/ 9621) 
is it oh that is a good day 

Recording: (473/ 9621) 
yes for attention and uh yeah 

Recording: (474/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum but i do not know if that is i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce had that been an option um i i think it just i think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after the divorce is final i mean not do you see what does that not make any sense at all 

Recording: (475/ 9621) 
i well you know i i do not see how we can i mean i mean we can refuse to to see certain classes of movies or or watch certain classes of shows but i you know without getting into that first amendment thing i can not you know i do not see how we can have a code of conductyeah yeahwhy i do not know i i you know i have i have never seen it happen in in my lifetime you know so i do not i do not know if it could be but then of course it can not go on the same way forever you know i can not keep progressing i do not think 

Recording: (476/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (477/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (478/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (479/ 9621) 
uh essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time and it was i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we would heard from him uh and got a message that my motherinlaw had fallen and she was in an emergency the same hospital fortunately so we went down there then on the way home got a phone call on the self phone uh from the hospital but my fatherinlaw had some bleeding so he had to go back to the hospital and and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was and this was not unusual it was a horrible period and uh i think what made my wife and i the angryest was he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (480/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (481/ 9621) 
that is not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they do not understand math either even though it is very concrete 

Recording: (482/ 9621) 
dellant does not seem to work too swiftly 

Recording: (483/ 9621) 
yeah it is a really discipline school but it is a lot of rebellion at the same time 

Recording: (484/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (485/ 9621) 
sometimes i think that it is just like math socks and it is like 

Recording: (486/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (487/ 9621) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (488/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (490/ 9621) 
it is just major thing that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (491/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (492/ 9621) 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the the girls should were both of them should love their bodies and not you know give it to a boy that you know fallen all over you and your you you feel all goodness and that you should respect yourself and love your body and you know do not let do not give yourself to somebody just because you are feeling you are feeling good um and the boys i should the boys need to calm down um i do not i mean 

Recording: (493/ 9621) 
she has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (494/ 9621) 
yes there are a few people that i know that use it 

Recording: (495/ 9621) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would have voted because i did not think that mike homeman exactly had christma either 

Recording: (496/ 9621) 
oh i 

Recording: (497/ 9621) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have paid off about five years so then we are talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (498/ 9621) 
huhuh like i think i think uh high school in general like that people always talk about raising the standards you know for for high school things but um i think um it is kind of like it is it is really hard to to like i have thought about before just what is wrong with like the education system in general like i do not know i think it is more of uh more of like uh it is college is a little bit different i guess but it is more of like this whole like the teacher teacher is it like the information goes from like the like the teachers uh mouth to the students you know it is just like out without going through either of their brains you know it is like just like real monotonous and like you know dates and blah blah blah about you know just like it is it is uh it is real structured but it is real hard to think about what the i can what to do to change that it is kind of like more like i do not know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my history teachers and english teachers were really good um 

Recording: (499/ 9621) 
was she where is she from latin massachusetts 

Recording: (500/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (501/ 9621) 
you see 

Recording: (502/ 9621) 
and you do not the problem is as a youngster as you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably until you are about thirty five forty do not realize my goodness my god you may have sacrificed because now i am learning and remember what you did and then by the time you are uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you got to take care to carry your parents if you had the morals do it otherwise just ship them up to the farm 

Recording: (503/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (504/ 9621) 
the three r is you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (505/ 9621) 
right and they were actually able to select a couple from a they were talked to a lawyer who ranges options and she had a file and they you know through kind of a bunch of questions and answers type thing were able to limit to them to three couples and they like the first couple they met so 

Recording: (506/ 9621) 
go along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (507/ 9621) 
definitely 

Recording: (508/ 9621) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (509/ 9621) 
in a lot of it was the the bitterness of the divorce 

Recording: (510/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (511/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (512/ 9621) 
they do not do it today unless the person is a scholar i mean i have got three point eight road scouts and i am like hey okay 

Recording: (513/ 9621) 
so it it is been very difficult for us to particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was between the time my fatherinlaw died my motherinlaw died which was in a five month period so my wife is had an awful lot to deal with um and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (514/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (515/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (516/ 9621) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him eitherized 

Recording: (517/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (518/ 9621) 
no i would not have 

Recording: (519/ 9621) 
getting of some place stable 

Recording: (520/ 9621) 
i think it is the right position to take um but it like abortion that is one of the the big issues that divide people very quickly i think it is moderating somewhat uh as the gay activist continue their campaigns um but that is one where kennedy has to tread very carefully um i was proud that coleman set it and did it and and did not back down on that um they told me a little bit about his character um i do not know that i can answer your question straight forward because i believe in gay right i believe in anybody is rights i know what happens between consent adults in a bedroom is their business not mine 

Recording: (521/ 9621) 
yeah it was like yeah um it was five weeks early delivering so it was really you know replanted as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (522/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (523/ 9621) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with um chief jackson and the whole mayorial candidates how they are getting debates over that and i know this is something new on top of that um i know it was from page on sunday is paper i looked at it briefly um uh i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (524/ 9621) 
well i would say in springfield yeah 

Recording: (525/ 9621) 
right right and i think there is uh you know there is so many small communities like even though oh issue is really obviously it is own it is own low community and then you have got you know double it and they have got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that that there really is a lot of things to do in uh an individual area that i can not see somebody from double and going over to the left side to to do anything you you know and i i do not and then maybe also i i feel safer where i live too and and that is something that is an issue for me i know when i do travel down cleveland now and it makes me it does it makes me nervous so i just kind of stay away from that 

Recording: (526/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (527/ 9621) 
i was forty eight when i retired so that is great that is terrific 

Recording: (528/ 9621) 
not well it is like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you go out and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that then you have somebody else do that part but i do not do like major cutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah blah so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (529/ 9621) 
umyou know they are a sort of middle of the line dress that would be like at the limited here something is you know seventy five pounds you know at like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them and limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but you know really if you buy that you are not really going to be buying you know more than one or like anything else for a while and i think i mean here there is that sort of like you know he has the most winds or whatever that you know phrase is and you know there is that with cd is and whatever but i do not know i mean even with the food and everything else i mean it is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean they are you know the portions are a lot smaller it is more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean the obesity problem here and everything else i mean it is getting worse there than it was but i mean it is nowhere is it anywhere near and that is a large part of the like problem with that people work constantly on me but oh where americans so sad like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (530/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (531/ 9621) 
i get a job at at high park so that will i mean it is just amazing because the money is so good you know you really can not beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever um high park well it is a it is a restaurant it is up in double a and so i do not know i mean i i did that all through high school and college and after i actually after i graduated from high school i moved to a restaurant for about a year and a half 

Recording: (532/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (533/ 9621) 
i look like a college student that would go here so i have never had a problem so we go and do that and like we are planning a road ship we we we are not we have not decided we are thinking at atlantic city or uh florida or new york city or new orleans those situations were trying to narrow a town 

Recording: (534/ 9621) 
has to be a long standing kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than um i i understand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh this is opening the door crack and the next thing you know uh you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gave marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either 

Recording: (535/ 9621) 
i do not remember that at all i know how to i know how to do it but i am not sure who taught me how to do it 

Recording: (536/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (537/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (538/ 9621) 
say 

Recording: (539/ 9621)

Recording: (568/ 9621) 
oh yeah you can not get them off 

Recording: (569/ 9621) 
because i have a real good sense of you know how things have to be and it is just see my husband and i are very different we are we are very different but we have we are really lucky we have a fabulous relationship and you know and he is real grateful and appreciative and you said as long as he appreciates you know like he will come home and say

Recording: (576/ 9621) 
we won we were victorian we did not win you know 

Recording: (577/ 9621)

Recording: (578/ 9621) 
that does not obviously the the civilization is going to be dead you know so 

Recording: (579/ 9621) 
and he is white just a real down just look like he is from the ghetto just nasty guy 

Recording: (580/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (581/ 9621) 
yeah right if you are lucky but i mean there is the person that says that and then there is the other person that says well i sure admire what you do and i would not be a teacher for anything in this world you know and that the one that is just in all of you 

Recording: (582/ 9621) 
so i i should i should really realize this parking situation but like i said i usually walk in and today i do not really feel like it um i um i am having a baby in about two weeks here i am really ready to get this over with 

Recording: (583/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (584/ 9621) 
right well when i was teaching taking teacher education classes here um and observing classroom teachers um they would always tell me you need to give a grade for class participation 

Recording: (585/ 9621) 
once in a while the whole state of the band is once in a month 

Recording: (586/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (587/ 9621) 
no um-hum 

Recording: (588/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (589/ 9621) 
yeah and him had not been department 

Recording: (590/ 9621) 
well as i told my daughter when she came on i said you know religion is is there is a business she said oh no dad is not religion i said it sure is a business i said it is just that the superficial things the packages are attracted to you 

Recording: (591/ 9621) 
it used to be real wild when i was a kid 

Recording: (592/ 9621) 
so that is where he is always parked 

Recording: (593/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (594/ 9621) 
it is and i saw like one of my friends that works so hard to get an mit 

Recording: (595/ 9621) 
oh it is some committee i mean you have to send them in to some place at the state of ohio 

Recording: (596/ 9621) 
they said that they said it is pretty much uh regular like just uh in a western weather brady weather they said the rice and 

Recording: (597/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (598/ 9621) 
right and and also the other thing is you you have to be sort of compassionate because like you know you are you are working a lot of airplanes and you are wanting answers like this when you still something out you want an answer you know each airplane is supposed to respond with a calls on like if i tell somebody you know turn left getting three six there on he is supposed to respond t to a three ninety six roger well if he does not respond then i have got to say it again which means instead of ten airplanes i now have eleven i am talking to because i have to tell talk to him two times each so you know there are some people that get really mad quick because they want that answer like that where you know i was a pilot so sometimes i am thinking you know

Recording: (603/ 9621) 
yeah i had about three or four friends that were actually game 

Recording: (604/ 9621) 
and so you had to 

Recording: (605/ 9621) 
um i can not say that that really bother me like you said i mean it is something that is his choice his opinion and whatnot and i mean it is up to him it does not affect the nation any or anything like that i mean he is still as long as he is making the right decisions or whatever then 

Recording: (606/ 9621)

that is right it is safe for a point of kids but it is true you know and and they really my mom really has worked with them to make sure that that they get into some programs that they need and there are some things now i think that they are developing that they did not have before

Recording: (655/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (656/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (657/ 9621) 
yeah it is got to be hard if you have not had other projects 

Recording: (658/ 9621) 
yeah it is uh you can if you are if you can not go to a grill storm until i think maybe the afternoon i think maybe eleven i am not sure uh but you have to be out by a certain time uh it is not as bad as like malone i do not know if you have heard about malone they have like certain days so it is not like that but it is still just a pain 

Recording: (659/ 9621) 
it is only a yeah it is only a couple people it is not majority of people are working around black but like i said a majority of the people i am working around i get along with great 

Recording: (660/ 9621) 
see 

Recording: (661/ 9621) 
no matter 

Recording: (662/ 9621) 
well uh 

Recording: (663/ 9621) 
i was taking like you know twenty one twenty three hours a quarter so 

Recording: (664/ 9621) 
um-hum and you can do parttime you can do three or two day a week 

Recording: (665/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (666/ 9621) 
i am going out there like this and i am freaking towards i swear but there is kids out there always cutting 

Recording: (667/ 9621) 
um-hum because i want his morals and his you know his basic stuff to come from me really 

Recording: (668/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (669/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (670/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (671/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (672/ 9621) 
asard and ad in the paper uh but i have sung well sean sings in the symphony course too i have sung for sixteen years 

Recording: (673/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (674/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (675/ 9621) 
i just renewed my certificate last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go you can range hours with a student that is at home for some reason uh i had one that just had a baby and uh they it is an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry and one i think chemistry once and it it was uh algebra two another time but they expected us to at least they expected me uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history so it really requires you to be well rounded and i i like kind of like that um i have taught in a couple of other places uh community colleges the college in new york i taught a chemistry class there and uh community college which is in hillsboro but i taught at their branch and i taught uh an introduction to a college class there and a introduction to uh introduction to the arts it was called and that was interesting it was those are it is kind of an underclass of teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour so 

Recording: (676/ 9621) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is their perspective in that sense 

Recording: (677/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (678/ 9621) 
okay it was kind of uh it was different when i because see because when i went in uh i mean well i never had any problem with the black person or or i do not really care you know as long as they uh did their job and everything i am basically the same way today uh 

Recording: (679/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (680/ 9621) 
that is not enough uh-huh 

Recording: (681/ 9621) 
what they do uh they have like up to four or five months the first four or five months of pregnancy they are allowed to maintain once they start to show they do not let them go to the school anymore just for their uh health of the baby 

Recording: (682/ 9621) 
uh-huh plus you get so many different students and well like just walking over here the other day you know just kind of thought you know i am wondering how many of these people i walk by you know are going to be here in january because you know because i did you know i thought well this is cool man you know 

Recording: (683/ 9621) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people um bitch and complain all the time but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around trying to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is important john kennedy won if if if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per per per precinct one vote per precinct you know there would just been one additional vote either way and any of those pre things you know he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven eighteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9621) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how he is he is learned let us say he knows more than most kindergartners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedule right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we will go to different web sites sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes that what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to everything 

Recording: (685/ 9621) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposely tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from here you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad 

Recording: (686/ 9621) 
and he said even when he was in high school that they would have they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people like knives and you would have people with fifth fights but you would like guns is unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh the people feeliqued in high school i am sure but you know like i do not i was i did not feel that way but i like in rich respect i look back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if day it was like so dramatizing to them like that would be like for four years every day you are just like teased or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you i am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (687/ 9621) 
he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure in a situation like that thing is not gonna come up but we will we will deal with it 

Recording: (688/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (689/ 9621) 
yeah my mom are real close 

Recording: (690/ 9621) 
i do i do um art affairs 

Recording: (691/ 9621) 
you know and and it is just i think that not happen so often there is so many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you are talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (692/ 9621) 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the doors and i was you employee 

Recording: (693/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (694/ 9621) 
i asked him machine the next day it says my mother is decide to accept your offer and i thought well i do not want to do this is the one all you need to do now so i ended up talking to him and i i just explained to him that um he had caught me off guard and that i would had more time to reconsider it and that because it and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me he was a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it 

Recording: (695/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (696/ 9621) 
oh right 

Recording: (697/ 9621) 
well one thing you know being uh uh i came from basically poor poor uh uh lifestyle early life and everything you know so uh uh if anything i guess that kind of made me negative uh towards people that had influence and had money and did not do anything good with it you know i am a firm believer if you got something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what i could teach but you know that is that would be a good philosophy to go live by uh and people of other religions and everything but you know i learned a lot about religion when i i was raised baptist basically but uh i practice more catholic than anything else now uh but i am generally pretty knowledgeable about judiism and muslims and everything just because i find it interesting 

Recording: (698/ 9621) 
friend who her name was she was not really a friend she was a teacher when i was in college her name was mrs cosy and she got pregnant and she said everybody said she came in one day and said it is a girl it is a girl i found out it is a girl what are you going to name her rosy rosey cosy you have got to be kidding she is um just putting you on uh 

Recording: (699/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (700/ 9621) 
i do not think it is really i do not think it is really affected me i mean obviously there is more places because shopping or to eat or there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for um but it is i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (701/ 9621) 
what department 

Recording: (702/ 9621) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has to be come closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or buy a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (703/ 9621) 
very very much so now fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we just define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are no longer a a democratic government as defined back there then uh yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition that is developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (704/ 9621) 
walks away 

Recording: (705/ 9621) 
it is like stay the heck out of my way here i come my world are welcome to it 

Recording: (706/ 9621) 
they did not like plot any weapon or anything like that it was just fifth fight yeah 

Recording: (707/ 9621) 
so okay 

Recording: (708/ 9621) 
it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did 

Recording: (709/ 9621) 
and that was a nice birthday party 

Recording: (710/ 9621) 
faring away 

Recording: (711/ 9621) 
i think it is the best thing that ever the best thing in the world is a wonderful neighborhood 

Recording: (712/ 9621) 
they do because he just he is all out for himself 

Recording: (713/ 9621) 
but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they would come in the men 

Recording: (714/ 9621) 
no kids just think oh it can not happen to me i am invincible 

Recording: (715/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (716/ 9621) 
unit does it um and it was not that i had a bad family unit it was just that there was not you know we never talked about it my sister and time were just talking about that because we were were uh she goes we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and whatnot she goes you know mom and dad handed to me a book i am like they did 

Recording: (717/ 9621) 
we were following his gee we kept going and we kept going and this other gee i and i were sitting in the back and i suppose they know that german pass worked but uh but uh anyway they finally got out we finally got out to where there is a bunch of ruined farm or for ruined farmhouse and farm buildings and so on and uh i said oh this is it so uh we there there were some ti is entrymen around there and so uh we started looking around for a place to lay on i mean cut our bedrooms out so on and the next morning i do not know i guess i was looking for somebody that had a fire there warmup some some uh rice and something anyway one of the first guys i saw was the guy that i worked with my wife in the office there 

Recording: (718/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (719/ 9621) 
yeah he was lucky so 

Recording: (720/ 9621) 
i think it was a a nice thing about what we had uh we had uh grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicate with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special time we um emphasized the fact that um uh you know kids want to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to work for that uh aspect we uh asked them that they wanted to go on um a project with the class of with fine but you got to participate in it too we will we will match you with what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them responsibilities they grew up with the aspect they learned by being around some older people uh which uh i think was good 

Recording: (721/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (722/ 9621) 
pretty much yeah if you come easy to go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever 

Recording: (723/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am married i do not know if i am married or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually i mean yes some people i mean i know men several men who got married had children and then they decided they were okay okay where they gave before but they did like women 

Recording: (724/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (725/ 9621) 
um currently unemployed um-hum 

Recording: (726/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (727/ 9621) 
you know does that all go away about second grade 

Recording: (728/ 9621) 
no it uh like i am a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good so i i wanted to take a look at that and my roommate is a business major so he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess so he said he would show me around there uh also i i really do like i came down for a few games and things like that and i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like ashe is so small there is a select group that has enthusiasm but nothing like here i mean this is ridiculous everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and even there might be things they do not like specifically about the university they are uh i you do not hear any like whole like universal negative things about this about the university ever 

Recording: (729/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (730/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (731/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (732/ 9621) 
and it was just when drug culture was just you know starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything so out in the open you would have to talk to them about things and just say you know i am going to help you and i you know be there for them a hundred percent obviously those parents were too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be to blame my due 

Recording: (733/ 9621) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (734/ 9621) 
only the only can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that but people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in a you know in a place that no child could find it there to blame they are there to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents did not were clth i just find that really hard to believe if a child goes into a garage every night and you hear clinging and and they are buying gun metal and you know i then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a side on the internet 

Recording: (735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (736/ 9621) 
yeah i have got i have gotten plenty of people it is funny jameson mom asked me so is your mom going to come and stay with you for a week i said now i told my mom she started laughing because i mean of course for her to come over and help out is terrific but if she actually stayed up my house for a week i think we would just kill each other 

Recording: (737/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (738/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it might be um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (739/ 9621) 
four parties so because it is actually a market it is all done outside i like tonight we are going to the uh golf pavilion which is um it next to the highest theater it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (740/ 9621) 
yeah it is real it is like one of the closest fires and we go there because they have a huge patio and so you can just sit out and talk and and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too like we just bought access and allot is me and my roommates 

Recording: (741/ 9621) 
well my grew up with just my mom there she had four kids and i was a very quiet and did very well in school 

Recording: (742/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (743/ 9621) 
credit cards 

Recording: (744/ 9621) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (745/ 9621) 
um so i just you know something i was a little familiar with anyway uh i was just looking for something parttime 

Recording: (746/ 9621) 
um i guess that would be slightly different part of them and i am not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (747/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (748/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (749/ 9621) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (750/ 9621) 
and her to go she had thought she was letting you know glaring me i was 

Recording: (751/ 9621) 
plus i do not really feel like the republican party represents the bible as a whole like if their last political convention like in uh the last presidential election was ninety six they said one in ten of the delegates that were at a time in the convention were millionaers but granted i know more than ten people and not so to me i just feel like that is not a good representation 

Recording: (752/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (753/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (754/ 9621) 
yeah so 

Recording: (755/ 9621) 
and because largely because of the fear of not knowing and not knowing how to deal with the unseem 

Recording: (756/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (757/ 9621) 
i mean the drinking teachers i have usually been around for a really long time and i i would tip i my views are typically a little bit more democratic but uh not to say that i certainly would not vote um for the person that i thought would do the best job 

Recording: (758/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 9621) 
um-hum at this point um i am not uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together they are in so at such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it uh and if they do not pull their scores up uh they will you know 

Recording: (760/ 9621) 
and i have you know i have got a couple in chicago and and i have a couple in uh the washington area 

Recording: (761/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (762/ 9621) 
once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (763/ 9621) 
the runways ah well i think the youngest that i met was maybe twelve but that is you know still young 

Recording: (764/ 9621) 
well you know it is because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know did not cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars i would i was happy 

Recording: (765/ 9621) 
i do not know that is kind of a tricky question really because on the one hand obviously the kid definitely will get uh made fun of his teeth and things like that 

Recording: (766/ 9621) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (767/ 9621) 
my sister is last name is good night and when she had her first little girl she said she is going to name her gone and good night but she did not she did not 

Recording: (768/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (769/ 9621) 
i mean i i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i was thinking of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the other way you know and it is you know 

Recording: (770/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (771/ 9621) 
well i think sometimes it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been the kind of person to believe i never told my kids not to do something the i myself was doing example smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my different they know you are not old enough but i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age somebody can at another age possibly like go out on a date for example well he is going out on a party like that and i well he is already sixteen years old and i will wait until you your sixteen years old and you will be allowed to go to parts but by that time i will expect you to be able you know know what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and i know well i will not give you any examples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try i am swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl and but anyway i would always and i would just apologize if they did catch me doing something that i have been telling them no you cannot do i would apologize to see mommy was bad and mommy did that i got super in my mouth one time well well no no i mean now if you do not hear the story in funny well you would be just to see it i was making a pie and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie one of those that can get juicy sometimes and i had not put any aluminum foil or anything or anything to catch it and just as i started to get it out i spilled it and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word leny down here here is two little shoes 

Recording: (772/ 9621) 
the same thing you know i think they are terrific for the right things yeah 

Recording: (773/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (774/ 9621) 
freshman 

Recording: (775/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (776/ 9621) 
have him for bed but i mean i did not even know what i was doing 

Recording: (777/ 9621) 
we sat there then for oh and it was kind of funny we were uh there is another guy in i and the man out who was for it observer we are going out to a forward observation point and they uh observation the tenor what i raised a potato was was getting he was in one jeep hit of us and we were following him and of course we just had these little red black out lights they call them 

Recording: (778/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (779/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (780/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (781/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (782/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (783/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (784/ 9621) 
yeah that well it is just seems one out of the kids 

Recording: (785/ 9621) 
um-hum we got a few ideas um i am thinking that might you know be true i and 

Recording: (786/ 9621) 
sitting back waiting 

Recording: (787/ 9621) 
and then but the whole band and the cheerleers went to his house and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart wrench 

Recording: (788/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (789/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (790/ 9621) 
but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (791/ 9621) 
i think so i think so um it is it is so sad to see a girl you know have so many options closed off i do not mean it is by any stretch that it is a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (792/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (793/ 9621) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom as long as you are listing to them uh some people i do not care what their ages they just blow them off uh so that plus you have the i think an understanding of um the schooling they came from um 

Recording: (794/ 9621) 
similar with her communist 

Recording: (795/ 9621) 
i do have some relatives that are um step my stepmom is relatives that are there they are actually members of the mormon church 

Recording: (796/ 9621) 
yeah it it is i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is you know um let us see what it was my dakota card was a lot more difficult as somebody else did for me 

Recording: (797/ 9621) 
oh good 

Recording: (798/ 9621) 
it ai not that far it is uh 

Recording: (799/ 9621) 
i just can not believe and they said they did not even know what was going on 

Recording: (800/ 9621) 
a two hundred thousand dollar house in everywhere around me and he 

Recording: (801/ 9621) 
on different topics 

Recording: (802/ 9621) 
i see it working unfairly 

Recording: (803/ 9621) 
i am i am sure i am sure australia you know welcome all those dollars but do they have like little like a like a like a wedding industry 

Recording: (804/ 9621) 
a famous one 

Recording: (805/ 9621) 
i have never heard anybody going a shooting rampage that were high on top most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza 

Recording: (806/ 9621) 
gave me these leading questions and i said uh-huh i know we are coming from and i have been come from that when i was in the high state and so forth and um so i just laid on the line to her 

Recording: (807/ 9621) 
i got on birth control probably when i was like sixteen or seventeen but still i did not take the pills all the time and you know that was not very good for me either 

Recording: (808/ 9621) 
it is like you know like some of these places in florida kind of like roon by terris you know like fort lauderdale and daytona you know it is like after after the kids get done you know they just like well you know forget it it is like because because i used to when i was in in um like a freshman um i heard i heard like do not even go to florida because like they they do not want students you know they want your money but they do not like they do not like your they do not like you know the the trash and and whatnot that they bring 

Recording: (809/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (810/ 9621) 
defense on who is the manager is at the time every manager is got a different agenda on what they want you to do 

Recording: (811/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (812/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (813/ 9621) 
well you know she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 

Recording: (814/ 9621) 
the one girl had um showed her her her her father found and then that is when it was like oh this is cute and like well wait a minute i thought he was against it they are not always against it though 

Recording: (815/ 9621) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or you know something like that you call the contract i will be in thursday you know if your air conditioning so they are always going to have to have people here so i just feel they are either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have twenty people that half of them know what is going on half of them do not so but that is tough to do when you are starting people with eight dollars an hour and stuff so but it is you know wendy is mcdonald is places that you can make that money so um-hum my you know to me the thing that hurt me the most attitude is they want to put caps on our salaries so i am at the highest scale i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to until once i move into supervision or something up in the and i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are going to put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am only like fifty cents away from that cap and if that is the case if i retire in six years i will be capped out right now so in other words i am going to retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but that was not even on the negotiating table they were still worried about this two dollars and get this house yeah that is what they were fighting for was the low end and try to get the hospital and the main campus the same 

Recording: (816/ 9621) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do i mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an extravagant or who could not you would be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then the other people uh that i know of one that i work with on a regular basis he is got a master is degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weakest ones you know and it is uh 

Recording: (817/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (818/ 9621) 
in the way of benefits 

Recording: (819/ 9621) 
i am real quite a bit of that 

Recording: (820/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (821/ 9621) 
no i wanted to see her obviously but 

Recording: (822/ 9621) 
he just kept saying gas gas gas i kept saying i do not want to guess so the first day of school i got lots of stuff to do we do not have time to play golfing games i said spell your last name he said g u e s s talk about feeling stupid 

Recording: (823/ 9621) 
but to go see something like cats or rent they still charge you out the really okay 

Recording: (824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (825/ 9621) 
because you got to trust the people you are around you do not really want to piss them off 

Recording: (826/ 9621) 
um working on three different um research projects with three different physicians to are um specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at long term out comes and people that have the same traumatic brain injuries the other one is a drug study um looking at control of agitation and the other one is a um spinal injury research study 

Recording: (827/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (828/ 9621) 
which is great 

Recording: (829/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (830/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (831/ 9621) 
yeah i think i got really good um i would actually been thinking about it like what departments in the school were good and which ones were not um the foreign language is really good they have a persian classes from like a second level 

Recording: (832/ 9621) 
again they said the 

Recording: (833/ 9621) 
was not really farming country and he went he went out there from iowa where you throw a hundred dollars on the field 

Recording: (834/ 9621) 
they are two elderly women that at the church this has been about up seven or eight years ago father just mentioned that they had a need uh they had had a church bus and it had broken down so they had a need for to get people to church and i met these two elderly women now the one now is ninety she turned ninety last october and the other one is about seventy eight now and they live together and i take them to church on sunday 

Recording: (835/ 9621) 
it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like emission homes 

Recording: (836/ 9621) 
for whatever reason yeah 

Recording: (837/ 9621) 
that and i imagine that is about half and half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is in evolution at this time to tell you the truth what is going to cause the world to end i think what they really mean by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it is being run or the way it is being acted out today and that people will not be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to redib living there is a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration it might sound very basic but it is very the very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this like you said me me me and i got to have this nice status symbol stuff and really if we older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids but i know i myself in my own home i have been a collector now i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time when he was out of work guess what i do not know what welfare agents it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first dog baby i ever had and i remember when i tried to wash the thing off that little dog was one of those that sort of melted in the water and my mother said well if you do not have to take care of it any better now i will never buy another one and believe it she did not 

Recording: (838/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (839/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (840/ 9621) 
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too and 

Recording: (841/ 9621) 
and it makes you a a better person because you get the spirit reality inside your driving yeah and that is what is going to take you home i often ask if people uh if you ask me about marketing 

Recording: (842/ 9621) 
like end uh of is all those little words you are already supposed to know those you are supposed to be able to write a sentence even if it is just a little short sentence like my name is joe ann i live at buffalo ball street i mean it is incredible it is like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down 

Recording: (843/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (844/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (845/ 9621) 
i did not i i did not want to go to school 

Recording: (846/ 9621) 
cuff 

Recording: (847/ 9621) 
yeah just one concert 

Recording: (848/ 9621) 
as long as you uh said i had already i just knew i was going to be getting another so because i flunked out like in december you know and uh so in january i would already contacted the navy and the air force uh about getting into they are taking our test and everything and taking their uh physicals uh so 

Recording: (849/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (850/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (851/ 9621) 
you had a harvest did not you 

Recording: (852/ 9621) 
and i mean it is basically any time i have free i mean it is not like i have a set schedule of when i have to work and things like that it is just whenever i feel like i have to do it 

Recording: (853/ 9621) 
none whatsoever 

Recording: (854/ 9621) 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it is so forced about as well i mean i i came um just before halloween and you know i i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like right there we are just like cakes cop cakes because you like everything just right in front of you with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean all the holidays and here are so pushed at you and it is such a money making you know and it is so over the top where there it is sort of like there is a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff at christmas but it is not so much you know and and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there there is not that at all i mean at least in you know my experience there and i mean i can not imagine because you know western europe i think is sort of as much like america as you can get probably you know most places elsewhere in in the world and i mean that would have been a fantastic experience 

Recording: (855/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (856/ 9621) 
the west side 

Recording: (857/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (858/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (859/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (860/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (861/ 9621) 
not really no i was too proud i would have never i would have never i think my dad paid my first month rent for me though i paid him back and then i never i never wanted to borrow any money i guess just growing up the youngest of five i appreciated money 

Recording: (862/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (863/ 9621) 
hi i am a pervertible 

Recording: (864/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (865/ 9621) 
my father died when i was two so i think just being raised you know by a single parent 

Recording: (866/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (867/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah very much so 

Recording: (868/ 9621) 
i just actually i was going to send my son to a christian kindergarten but i decided to home school instead so i have been home schooling him for kindergarten 

Recording: (869/ 9621) 
train your trash speaking of what movies are playing uh but i do not really rely on it heavily for news 

Recording: (870/ 9621) 
and so you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown it is not it is not because i have to it is not because he you know he would not do something that that something else it is the suits me fine 

Recording: (871/ 9621) 
and unfortunately they have to do what the people or the pets say but it is just i could not me around that and you know i would go off on people that would do that bring it in i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth sometimes uh i am not a violent man either even as big as i am you know so 

Recording: (872/ 9621) 
better than us i guess 

Recording: (873/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (874/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (875/ 9621) 
um i am um well entitled senior consulting data base specialist work for a company called uh c l c it is in double and uh i am working well it is hard to say what i do i can solve on a lot of projects 

Recording: (876/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (877/ 9621) 
we both love sports um we love college football 

Recording: (878/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (879/ 9621) 
as much as she could yeah we were poor but we managed 

Recording: (880/ 9621) 
yeah uh i i think that he is he is right that our my generation was more uh ohi do not do not want to say spiritual but more morally uh well directed than at least a lot of the kids today 

Recording: (881/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (882/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (883/ 9621) 
you know so he could get a look at them which is very for respectful but you know there is some psychos out there i mean i mean there is some psycho around here in town called rain bow eagle gave himself that name 

Recording: (884/ 9621) 
to be a rat 

Recording: (885/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (886/ 9621)

Recording: (887/ 9621) 
it is it is kind of a fun game it is just strange because uh like we are on i came down in semester so there is still months where everyone was down here and now there is like nobody down here so it is myself my two roommates and maybe a handful of like other people that we know so it like the social aspect is like has has diminished a lot but that is still i mean for fun we uh play a lot of video games too like i guess you would think like the natural thing things you would expect from a college guy 

Recording: (888/ 9621) 
wow do you talk psychology 

Recording: (889/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (890/ 9621) 
it is like a car dealer that goes you know the uh cd player with uh blah blah blah will only raise your payment another eight dollars and you are like yeah but that is about the fourteenth eight dollars you have added on to this you know and it all adds up 

Recording: (891/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (892/ 9621) 
um as far as affiliated with a party i probably respond to um republicans more the democrats but i think given any um given any choice of any party at all i am probably more libertarian than anything else 

Recording: (893/ 9621) 
um-hum so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking now i got to get it together what am i going to do so he uh agreed to go to a psychiatrist and uh so he went on riddlein uh so he took the riddlein through his uh the last of his junior year and his senior year now he is on a medication they call uh well future his doctor um does not believe in midland 

Recording: (894/ 9621) 
yeah it was painful but no worse than going to the hospital and for my back surgery back surgery is really worse than a heart attack ever was 

Recording: (895/ 9621) 
and each people that hear voices they are not looseenating they are hearing voices as spirit and in many cultures they will tell you most uh indigentist cultures throughout the world will tell you and the history will show that those people were very as gifted 

Recording: (896/ 9621) 
um weekends i usually try and keep free so that i can mix stuff up um it i do not know weekends are the usually the the one night of the week that is not hardly well scheduled wednesday nights are preparing for travel 

Recording: (897/ 9621) 
some places you are allowed to wear sandals and 

Recording: (898/ 9621) 
or they you know they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 

Recording: (899/ 9621) 
yeah they 

Recording: (900/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (901/ 9621) 
uh he had an aneurism he had uh high blood pressure which we knew about and uh he started um you know not being himself he went to the doctor and they did some tests and found out he had this aneurism that had to be operated on right away and he died uh under the anestetic of a heart attack so it was very sudden and unexpected 

Recording: (902/ 9621) 
it is these uh that has a set up where um they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

Recording: (903/ 9621) 
um honestly i can not say it really bothers me too much um i mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever it does not bother me at all it is just something i do not want to deal with or whatnot um so i mean the fact that i mean to people the same sex are living together or married or whatnot that does not bother me like i said it is just more something that i do not know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot it is i think it is just more because it is so different than like what you normally see or things like that 

Recording: (904/ 9621) 
you can not explain that and those have been questions that i have been asked by my our children well how do you want to oh gee how do you how do you 

Recording: (905/ 9621) 
no humans are violent by nature i believe i mean people have been at war since the beginning of man it it is more or less greed they cause violence it is not media just like the extra c was in advertisement showing what you could do tv is showing you violence that you could do if you are driven to it 

Recording: (906/ 9621) 
that it is still really going on you know and his parents accepted him 

Recording: (907/ 9621) 
you know with the system 

Recording: (908/ 9621) 
you know they all get uh sideline and side tracked by special private interest and that is that is a bottom line and it is sad but there is so i i choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible we ended up selling for 

Recording: (909/ 9621) 
so and it was it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen and so pete was just like some kid who liked to play you know we would go and buy kites and and do all this fun stuff and 

Recording: (910/ 9621) 
yeah like underground yeah it is gotten real big like it is still different too there is still like a really big scene and there is still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (911/ 9621)

Recording: (930/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (931/ 9621) 
what i have liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it is not right and that is right i mean there was the episode 

Recording: (932/ 9621) 
um well maybe not columbus in particular but i do not know i was i think i was just a little far enough because i was doing the two majors when i was i had a heavy course load every quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so i would you know done seven straight quarters and i am sure that attitude and i had a lot of hard classes and you know i was just tired of a hard state and tired of being here and you know red tape and 

Recording: (933/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (934/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (935/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (936/ 9621) 
i do not believe that 

Recording: (937/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (938/ 9621) 
and they uh they have these feds that go through and somebody asked me my opinion about the poke them on i said oh brother you know it could not be any worse than what was those turtles that lived in the sewers

Recording: (942/ 9621) 
so and it was fun and i i made we made about nine thousand on it by the time we were done 

Recording: (943/ 9621) 
yeah they are very quantity of it as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all bottom line in the numbers because actually that is why i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well though in in my opinion though i not losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover and things like that then then if you have a product that that because obviously the people are not going to care you know so and they they they seem very close minded like like this is the way business has to be but the professors do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (944/ 9621) 
she graduated last year so uh but she went to she went she is in home study so

Recording: (948/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (949/ 9621) 
and you have been going to the united states that whole time 

Recording: (950/ 9621) 
and people do not seem to understand that uh it is not like you are collecting data for a hundred the entire population or the entire university or working with the sample trying to represent the different very well sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not 

Recording: (951/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (952/ 9621) 
uh my main 

Recording: (953/ 9621) 
even in the package of information 

Recording: (954/ 9621) 
take them to the grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but and i do not do it as regularly now because of the advance and age you know 

Recording: (955/ 9621) 
yeah i uh well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work in secure jobs like that i mean you i had a different job every year i mean a year would come up and i would say okay here we go you know they are either going to down size or they are going to do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i did notick or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (956/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (957/ 9621) 
yeah and a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for an very intellectual interesting environment um-hum but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that 

Recording: (958/ 9621) 
yes you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in the family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the spring back oh you came from this little tube here oh okay dad is the principal said no i have to be because there is no father here well

Recording: (964/ 9621) 
i like the social aspects that are the problem so

um-hum 

Recording: (971/ 9621) 
well is there any kind of you know training i mean are they doing like the whole job training after the two years or during the two years 

Recording: (972/ 9621)

Recording: (974/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (975/ 9621) 
really you know what is happened to a million dollars is still out of out of our out of our range 

Recording: (976/ 9621)

Recording: (981/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (982/ 9621) 
with your children of light 

Recording: (983/ 9621) 
once upon a time there was a gentleman named and he sat and he found himself because he was hot 

Recording: (984/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (985/ 9621) 
uh how do you picture it 

Recording: (986/ 9621) 
i do not i think that what they were protesting was that they were being involved in it was not that part of their protest 

Recording: (987/ 9621) 
oh yeah they are getting better though they really are they are much better now than they were twenty years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example 

Recording: (988/ 9621) 
and yeah uh yeah i should not have done that so now let us just go get some more furniture 

Recording: (989/ 9621) 
uh-huh right and they are in so much competition uh-huh 

Recording: (990/ 9621) 
i am not sure it is usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i do not know 

Recording: (991/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (992/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (993/ 9621) 
but i mean that is different time you know so nowadays it is a lot different uh yeah 

Recording: (994/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (995/ 9621) 
they do not have any like a day just they are not like on a day just to be sure is was really like 

Recording: (996/ 9621) 
course everybody else could but basically what it was uh it was a weird situation in high school 

Recording: (997/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (998/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i i do not know but it then then they second guess the mother and she risked her life and i they can not do that i mean you know it is too bad that you know she was not there to to go on with what they were planning on doing but it is not our right to to take other country is kids even i mean that is another thing i mean come to america we will take everyone and every you know but then we have all these this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that is all they have grown up with is a terrorist of foreign things that you know i you kind of want to do a study of how long they have been here and you know that would be interesting oh i think there is got to be a line drawn and i think that uh you know if they are if they are caught uh in in any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back but uh i just think that we are just too open with that and there is got to be a line to say this is as many people as as we care to you know i mean i know that is hard but and and it is hard to draw the line but then other countries if it is so miserable there then they need to work on their country because 

Recording: (999/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1001/ 9621) 
i think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and you know look all over the place for different plays you look on the screen and it is different you say well i would have done this and this and this but you know down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this you know 

Recording: (1002/ 9621) 
that the that the library did not isolated um boy i do not i 

Recording: (1003/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1004/ 9621) 
yeah we did that my wife and i have been to san francisco a couple of times the first time we did all the tourist things and the next time i was just going since just going bond around and see it we spent more time both of them are both of them are good for different you know 

Recording: (1005/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1006/ 9621) 
guns should definitely be kept in a lock box where kids can not get themgovernment can do it is more the parents responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids hands 

Recording: (1007/ 9621) 
you know that is his real father so i got to sit there and keep my mouth shut 

Recording: (1008/ 9621) 
i have not taken him that yet 

Recording: (1009/ 9621) 
something like that i do not i do not know much about it 

Recording: (1010/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1011/ 9621) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months of the first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1012/ 9621) 
i mean there are people that think cars will not run 

Recording: (1013/ 9621) 
yeah excuse me to pay the rent and that is yeah 

Recording: (1014/ 9621) 
so we have even been known to slightly start pulling out you know let the garage door go down i would sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she is on the couch and she is like i am fine 

Recording: (1015/ 9621) 
and then i got my master is in seventy five so it took me four years that way no i never i just was smart enough to do it before i had kids 

Recording: (1016/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1017/ 9621) 
and apparently that is the way of finishing a conversation uh one of the guys i usually go clubbing with he is the one that got me into a little stick dancing and he said uh he said there is like a sign that says come hit on me and i am like oh great that is that is just what i need that does not bother me does not bother me i just i just i sort of just i am just like now you know i am straight if they start if they start getting really you know really pushy about it i am just like i am straight but a lot of times it is really funny because i will get in a conversation with them and they will be like you are straight are not you i am like yeah they are yeah they i do not know how but they must it is just being i must guess it must be the way i talk or or or something but i think i keep a lot of them away because i do a lot of really i do a lot of really real blessed movements with my clothes too i am like slailing about and you know it is like this i got this wide birth around me yeah it it is not one of these it is one of these and yeah it is yeahyeah um-hum hm yeah 

Recording: (1018/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1019/ 9621) 
oh not very right and i twenty twenty years first twenty years i worked at the bureau i was worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they are misinterested and my wife uh has been the director of institutional research at the university uh data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there um 

Recording: (1020/ 9621) 
yeah or a conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my here is my dog my labrador and yeah full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting and uh they were objective you know and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and doing things up and and these people would bring them in and uh have them put to sleep 

Recording: (1021/ 9621) 
so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the husband he makes you know fairly decent money so you know she does not have to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby comes she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild uh my son when he was in high school had a girl no a little girl friend and she was of let us see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i guess she uh had a baby and uh i believe my son was in eleventh grade when that baby was born and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and uh she uh you know well my son left to move into the dorm here at our shoe and she uh moved in with me i think the baby was fifteen months old and i tried to help the young lady and it just turned out that the you know the young lady was not ready to be a mother my son would not even now is not ready to be a father so uh there was a you know whole investigation through children is services and uh they gave me custody of the child temporarily and she is still there she is four and a half the mother is married and has another child now and and the little one is still with me 

Recording: (1022/ 9621) 
well now they do not 

Recording: (1023/ 9621) 
not as an individual uh let us see that is a problem i have it is hard to find a balance between censorship and you know free flow of information uh and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running which i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while i guess it it is kind of interesting to watch these people uh but i mean and where do you draw the line when people should see and not see i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me what my kids can see uh i that is my job and if i do not want to see something on tv i will turn it off if i do not want my kids to see something on tv we will have an argument but it used to be easy whenever little you know now yeah you too and with a twenty one year old and an eighteen year old it is not as easy 

Recording: (1024/ 9621) 
for like summer project or something 

Recording: (1025/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1026/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1028/ 9621) 
if they want to get married that is their business i do not think it is mine or anyone else to say that they can not 

Recording: (1029/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1030/ 9621) 
i think more of along the lines of like physical abuses things like that um would be probably crossing the line um like if he got there are alleged uh excuse me if he was allegedly beating his wife or something like that obviously then yeah that that would cause a problem with mad i can not say that i would vote for anyone like that but i mean just like small things like that where it does not really threaten the nation or anything and i mean it is just something that happened 

Recording: (1031/ 9621) 
and i have one at north when high school she is a sophomore there and the one at ou use a freshman and uh i married and uh what else i live in uh northeast columbus by seventy one and one sixty one and that is about it 

Recording: (1032/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1033/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1034/ 9621) 
getting married having kids you know and having a nice place to live 

Recording: (1035/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1036/ 9621) 
yeah all my family still lives around me pretty much yeah 

Recording: (1037/ 9621) 
and it only took uh less than two months 

Recording: (1038/ 9621) 
donate so much from the okay well let you remember back sometime they were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave 

Recording: (1039/ 9621) 
people graduate get degrees from the high state working here taking one course a one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them two ten years or something you know but it is like why not it is free 

Recording: (1040/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1041/ 9621) 
where i live now i have lived there for eleven years 

Recording: (1042/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1043/ 9621) 
and that maybe would like crash one the the wedding the 

Recording: (1044/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1045/ 9621) 
but i have been in situations where people have told racist jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny please do not tell them anymore in my presence do what you want when you are with your other friends but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blonde jokes i find those sexist and racist in a way and i i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working and then in an office they were telling fifteen or twenty of them in the row and i just kept a stone face but at one or two i did smile but they were trying to get me to laugh and i would not but uh 

Recording: (1046/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1047/ 9621) 
okay how do you do how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (1048/ 9621) 
i think a lot of people do not understand a lot of people do not it is a mind set uh uh they do not want to deal with numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple and that is what they are looking for they do not really want to know what it means uh and a statistic under any any definition is nothing more than an average of some kind 

Recording: (1049/ 9621) 
yeah it was like fresh little stuff were year 

Recording: (1050/ 9621) 
while saying well platoon everything and sinuses dumb and stuff as as far as bringing it together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1051/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1052/ 9621) 
i can not i am in a luxury i guess where we are in a position where i i truly do not have to work so if i ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he was not getting what he wanted or needed i would quit and rb to to to take care of that but having family with him the first year and a half um i do not know i got all my schooling everything out of the way i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born to have more time with him um i do not know it is a whole different society with email and the uh computer and the internet age uh the telephones i mean it is in some regards it is much more connected but some are impersonal and uh i think uh i do not know mom is being outside the home i think so many families are forced to do that with the cost of and is it the cost or is it the once it is a very material society right now but it is also a very um good economical time too stock market overall is been up i know it is down right now but overall so the money is been flying and houses and buildings and 

Recording: (1053/ 9621) 
yeah i would i would say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it i do not think that you should throw out english or math or you know can not believe what i am saying this history but i do not think you should throw out that stuff but i do not think that there should be as much emphasis on it i think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on your own and take care of yourself and but definitely i think that there is other 

Recording: (1054/ 9621) 
you know i mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never wanna you know ever say anything but um yeah that 

Recording: (1055/ 9621) 
oh yeah well i do not know 

Recording: (1056/ 9621) 
what we are animals 

Recording: (1057/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1058/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1059/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1060/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1061/ 9621) 
uh i do not think i would want my kid to go to day care crazy 

Recording: (1062/ 9621) 
i do not know how that is even possible 

Recording: (1063/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1064/ 9621) 
but yeah 

Recording: (1065/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1066/ 9621) 
no i pray and i you know i do not think you know what i am uh preying to or anything like that 

Recording: (1067/ 9621) 
but i 

Recording: (1068/ 9621) 
one 

Recording: (1069/ 9621) 
they get caught with that stuff or him and nothing happens and it just that is just a horrible example that here you have got you know some regular some eighteen year old kids that this is really stupid and he is ten years in jail and then you have got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can he can left it you know and you just it is just it is so it is just wrong 

Recording: (1070/ 9621) 
which one of them 

Recording: (1071/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1072/ 9621) 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather and i know about it you are going to tell me that fog pushed that two foot pine tree across the way i mean it was a thick tree too and uh we get up to the next gas station he fills up and listening on the intercom they had news on their weather and stuff tornado warning in that county i turned around and i said now see who is the dumb house here i said i bet you do not even know how it is spelled sears cloud or 

Recording: (1073/ 9621) 
for their behavior because if they were an ass hole before their brain injury they are going to be an ass hole after their brain injury five times 

Recording: (1074/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1075/ 9621) 
i think it is because parents are at work and they are busy making money and they are not teaching their kids any i mean they are not teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal you know um thanks for having me when you go to someone is house just the normal i can not tell you how many kids i have picked up and driven home when i picked up my son because it was raining or something and they just jump out of the car and go bye sign the door i turned to my son and i go do not you ever do that to someone is mother now how bad do you think i want to give him another right home when he did not even say thank you you know i did not have to bother to go out of my way and i would always try to use that as a way to explain to my kids okay you know this is how he handled it this is how i want you to handle it i do not ever want you to go to someone is house and not say thanks for inviting me thanks for having me i have really had a good time you know and i do not ever want you to sit at somebody else is table and go yuck i do not like that you know if they happen something for supper you do not like you pass it on and you go i do not care for anything you you know make a big scene like someone is or did the other night at my house that you know made me feel like this big when i am the cook 

Recording: (1076/ 9621) 
oh yeah there there 

Recording: (1077/ 9621) 
it is like bull 

Recording: (1078/ 9621) 
um if you are going to do something like that you better at least know the risks involved into it and what exactly you are doing before you do anything like that 

Recording: (1079/ 9621) 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars so 

Recording: (1080/ 9621) 
so we had a lot of time together and she said she thinks that was worth it 

Recording: (1081/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah right and you know what is going to happen it is only when it gets so bad that they can not even walk to their car they can not even go to to the store without being affected by that they can not say that anymore you know it is the people that if i do not see it it is not there they are the ones that are going to be the most shocked and they are the ones that are going to be panicked when everything you know because it is getting smaller the world is getting smaller we are we are more populated now than we ever have been so people need to learn to work together and to be together and 

Recording: (1082/ 9621) 
uh because i would not allow to wear jeans i would not allow to wear tennis shoes 

Recording: (1083/ 9621)

you know we my husband and i were just talking about this i was saying i am not in for the you know george beaure on nineteen four and big brother syndrome and all um my ideal situation would be that somebody decides who should have kids and who is not but i do not think god is going to come down and do that so you know what i mean we can not really decide that but to be honest i am for it um it does not have to be well i am not even sure tubes ties is is pretty permanent um but even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them two hundred dollars a year that is still not still much cheaper than them having kids um and then if they i give more money if they clean up their act just for them um as far as it being races i do not think i think they are missing the the point because i am sure there is some run away white teenage girls out there too or mexican or whatnot um 

Recording: (1093/ 9621) 
i got uh sounds like i bought a dog 

Recording: (1094/ 9621)

Recording: (1096/ 9621) 
i was reading a thing though in uh you said i think it was yesterday where uh you are uh minority in your your uh uh majority you know uh that is always been that when you know they were trying to make it seem like it is different it is always been like like the army has always been forty percent uh minority and sixty percent or something like that you know the air force has always been uh like seventy thirty or something like that you know because the standards are a little bit hard to get in a lot of people do not want to get into the you know they do not want to take them test and everything you know uh my uh a cousin that mostly uh spent twenty five years i think in new york because that is to get it done better but that is all he wanted to do you know be a general surgeon and stuff like that you know but uh i i i just think a lot a lot of times the media 

Recording: (1097/ 9621) 
you know so it is you know if you if you have a problem if you want to talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1098/ 9621) 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1099/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (1100/ 9621) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um 

Recording: (1101/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1102/ 9621)

Recording: (1103/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1104/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1105/ 9621) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am that i do not have a problem with it and i was in the men is league club for a while so there is a small percentage of the people in there that are you know that that are gays well and that is and and i really made friends with a lot of them i guess i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey you can be my friend i am cool i am all right even though i am not even though i am not one of you i can still be your friend which is sort of what i try and eliminate because i am i am very very religious and the christian community is very uh yes i am not going to say can be i say they are christian community is very very mean towards homosexuals and that is just not right i mean they are people they are making a mistake in my eyes yes but that does not mean i am going to look at them any differently as human beings they deserve my respect oh yeah but i see everyone is involving in central behavior because in my in my religion everyone is sense um i am a i am a christian i go to an all denomination church um i do not like the nomination i am not 

Recording: (1106/ 9621) 
a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (1107/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1108/ 9621) 
yeah he he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody signed for it but um he was one of the people that had really been yes and so he fired him but not for that because you can not do that it is illegal so he but he sent a form letter with everybody it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names were changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (1109/ 9621) 
yeah i have two other sisters um one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced uh the five of us were all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on our second except for one she is divorced and she has not remarried and then my oldest i told you knacker and i guess she is not remarried 

Recording: (1110/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1111/ 9621) 
she is the type of person i love to in no way 

Recording: (1112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1113/ 9621) 
but she is young that everybody is prejudiced against her and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1114/ 9621) 
no that is not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people are are get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1115/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1116/ 9621) 
you would be sleeping on the beach before you would shell out that kind of bugs 

Recording: (1117/ 9621) 
i do not understand that 

Recording: (1118/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1119/ 9621) 
uh essentially all the big academics most of the un it is actually all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1120/ 9621) 
uh once she was there with her pregnancy but she did and i am just going to do public school 

Recording: (1121/ 9621) 
oh yeah uh-huh it is the biggest thing 

Recording: (1122/ 9621) 
i have seen the uh big emphasis and what is that that that what is that the opera house yeah right right on the right on the west of the desert or whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1123/ 9621) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person that you just have a different way of going about it probably 

Recording: (1124/ 9621) 
yeah and uh i had the prohibitive i could have gone somewhere else and made more money you know but the bad part was is the university is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raises and everything so at least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1125/ 9621) 
yeah that is it 

Recording: (1126/ 9621) 
well i was uh iestably about responsibility and that sort of thing before i went into service that was the oldest son in a family of ten 

Recording: (1127/ 9621) 
uh without going into too much detail um one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really stumble across a lot of interesting doctor and and physiological beliefs and i believe that stuff now and he does not and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heritage and he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours and before he left for alaska i actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were i am in each other and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about uh you know talked about not liking i believe and i and i told him i said i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you are looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the bible and expand it to crystal clarity and they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it anymore denomination she came out of it um some of the more devout churches within the apollo christian church were talking men said on one side women said on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry the german is read in three different languages it is really whacky stuff 

Recording: (1128/ 9621) 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting in any kind of trouble or anything with he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (1129/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1130/ 9621) 
no nobody has a daughter and that was from high school uh his girlfriend uh got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work things out but they never got married and that was when he lived in canada so she lives in canada now and he goes you know he talks to her all the time and then they are real open about that i mean she is real good about letting the little girl come and she will stay this summer with us and you know drive up there and see her too 

Recording: (1131/ 9621) 
i got told you i can be an idiot 

Recording: (1132/ 9621) 
so if you pretty much have to be you know a camping middle class in new york you have to be a little bit rich or you are not 

Recording: (1133/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1134/ 9621) 
no no 

Recording: (1135/ 9621) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (1136/ 9621) 
unless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1137/ 9621) 
no but oh she is really plain smart i mean 

Recording: (1138/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah uh now it is saying uh look cool public school does not should probably district should probably ought to get it the same as here but by being corkwood you know or they are totally small or anything um i think we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class you know so uh i felt i got better attention when i wanted it you know uh than i would have at a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1139/ 9621) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does not i mean i was surprised like i i would i have never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one actually 

Recording: (1140/ 9621) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look at like well my my friends have to do it and say well i know i have to do it you know they look at it like it is a big pain because i got to run over to the nurse and get their pillow at lunch medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what it is supposed to so they go back to the six hour dose you know one in the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they are like to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they are in denial just like we would be they say well it does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what other things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1141/ 9621) 
i think so yeah like their hair cuts are a certain way and can not you have to shave and um you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can unless it is really hot there is there is different also depending on the climate 

Recording: (1142/ 9621) 
and it is true um so that is the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god that is too damn big for me to handle do you think you can work on maybe helping change this person is heart or their mind because i can not do that um so you know i did not mean to get off on a tent yet then 

Recording: (1143/ 9621) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school let me get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i had known that when i was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed at eighteen because i could not vote until i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had to wait until i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that you know worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed if i would known that they were not going to vote at eighteen and were going to wait until they were almost forty i would not i would not have wasted my time um but anyway um you you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age 

Recording: (1144/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1145/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1146/ 9621) 
and then it is different businesses like white castle or pizza one of the pizza places and uh some of the super markets and things and they are advertised you know throughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to hucklary house and they do not have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know group of volunteers that go out and pick these kids up take them to hucklebury house which is not far from here so i did that for a while but uh was not very uh satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at hucklary house 

Recording: (1147/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1148/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1149/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1150/ 9621) 
well i am staying on the whole world i they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think that maybe he sounds the same way but maybe not as much as i have i thought when i retired i was going to get this done and this done and this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got so used to it done when i got home and i am sure i am doing it just as fast because over and over again people say i have never seen anybody with as much energy you are always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (1151/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1152/ 9621) 
right so they do not come see me and i guess they should not care because i i would just like actually i would like them to come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have that is like everybody just want to show it off 

Recording: (1153/ 9621) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than columbus though 

Recording: (1154/ 9621) 
and i think it was an article this last wednesday in the dispute and business section as to how the peo still can not regulate it and because that they want to deregulate telecommunications uh and so for the past months we have not been getting telephone bills for usage we had the back when we are paying for it and what is gonna happen all this whole thing is it offers us a a a lot of that to where with uh we can now uh if we have a contractor let us say over in dayton and we are calling from zain isville office i rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going our date and we can make that call if it is a local call of wanting all long distance 

Recording: (1155/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1156/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1157/ 9621) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (1158/ 9621) 
kind of balance the brother out a little bit 

Recording: (1159/ 9621) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference uh i can not say from what i have seen the people that went to the catholic schools uh they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the madas they have to do here 

Recording: (1160/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with them 

Recording: (1161/ 9621) 
uh like because there is not like a like a like a fine lead lead person because it is just one person doing it and most of the time i mean like people do have groups that play like technical beat or in music but it is not like a lead singer who like you know it is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (1162/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 9621) 
it is extremely difficult to deal with 

Recording: (1164/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1165/ 9621) 
oh yeah we have probably been five six times already and 

Recording: (1166/ 9621) 
talk to them like you know this be nice then um 

Recording: (1167/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1168/ 9621) 
um not really i mean i have been with a few people that have just i mean just randomly gotten kind of jumped on me they did not steal anything they just beat them up for no reason or whatnot 

Recording: (1169/ 9621) 
yeah it was cutting twenty pounds in three days 

Recording: (1170/ 9621) 
white women who had actually had it done than uh than um hispanic or african american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the government i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is it is not so much money that it would radical change your life in a sort of you know it is not thousands of dollars it was two hundred i believe and and that is you know i mean if if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i do not know i think you know there is the debate about ten years down the line but you know is there going to be something that is going to make them change you know what is it you know what is it going to be and like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean i do not know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that but i mean i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than you know the government saying okay this is your cutoff limit but i mean the statistics they were getting on um the average number of children that these women were having and you know you know the average number of children that were just taken to the hospital and left there or you know just dropped off wherever and and the state that these children were in and their life span and everything else i mean you know there is the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the the child is life you know i mean i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and you know the same as in england you know everyone saying oh because they were talking about you know i mean again this was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of you know somehow sort of forcing the young girls to at least be in birth control you know in whatever way and and again that everyone was up in arms but it is sort of like you know what is that child is quality of life going to be when their mother is just you know 

Recording: (1171/ 9621) 
it took us ten years to have you know i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the subtle age of tone under tone you know is she her is not she else is just like well i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that was an on no to her but i was not but she needed to know that 

Recording: (1172/ 9621) 
and too much prejudice there really is still and it is sad but it there really is 

Recording: (1173/ 9621) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1174/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (1175/ 9621) 
in what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you know so 

Recording: (1176/ 9621) 
one thing okay go ahead well i one thing um i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe lots of people do not is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (1177/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1178/ 9621) 
so and i figure i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figure that would be a decent i mean it translates over because we are in semesters it will get all messed up there but it it is it is like i am halfway to three fourths done with a with my degree so if i wanted to transfer now it would be like after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits will not transfer over it would be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just figured right now i should look 

Recording: (1179/ 9621) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just everyone there is uh a bad dark side in the story so children just are and i mean it is in there that and then including my own daughter she and i swear i had her watch mister rogers all the time but now that she is older she watches tv she is addicted to tv something terrible and so of course there are children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have have tv when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimulations the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really goes you know and but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is face anymore as a matter of fact i am getting so i do not watch the news 

Recording: (1180/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (1181/ 9621) 
so um national tax dollars also get foreign state tuition 

Recording: (1182/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1183/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean and it was my money so why should it matter 

Recording: (1184/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (1185/ 9621) 
just people coming from high street and just happened happened to be centralized right there on both sides of the avenue 

Recording: (1186/ 9621) 
i can check my account see how much money i got and they will actually list things that i have bought you know like how many or or a sixteen account and all that but you have bought check clearing because you have checks cleared 

Recording: (1187/ 9621) 
well i i i think we are oh yeah we are we are church goers but just to be going to church course is not is not being faithful i think it is just uh sharing yourself uh with one another in daily lives uh listening to someone out reaching to someone where it might be that is the the mystery that uh i think our our our lord has given us 

Recording: (1188/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1189/ 9621) 
so i do not know whether they did any damage or not but 

Recording: (1190/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1191/ 9621) 
it really is 

Recording: (1192/ 9621) 
yeah the police said that they have been there many times 

Recording: (1193/ 9621) 
and if i say something then yeah they do not like 

Recording: (1194/ 9621) 
what do you 

Recording: (1195/ 9621) 
it is like an advertisement for it 

Recording: (1196/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1197/ 9621) 
twenty one million dollar check to hit the the door step you know 

Recording: (1198/ 9621) 
so but that is you know i ended up settling the time i got most of the money what little i had i invested some and then i made some bad investments when i went off my medication and uh you know blew it you know so that was my responsibility and my fault but uh you know how it was just uh years of penned up frustration and i just i spent it i spent it in a you know un docksway but you know i had fun doing it 

Recording: (1199/ 9621) 
yeah but the same time everyday yeah 

Recording: (1200/ 9621) 
she goes well you had dad dukakis money i said oh lord 

Recording: (1201/ 9621) 
i hope so yeah 

Recording: (1202/ 9621) 
they would not no i went to two different doctors and they said you possibly will change your mind and you know i was single uh maybe if i would have been married they might have considered it um but they said no way would they do it and we are talking fifteen years ago 

Recording: (1203/ 9621) 
but uh the company wanted to move florida and he did not want to move 

Recording: (1204/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1205/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1206/ 9621) 
r u t e 

Recording: (1207/ 9621) 
i probably vote for bush over clinton 

Recording: (1208/ 9621) 
i so i had a tendency that it would really help them um it would just be better if somebody could you know keep their eyes open or if we had um more counselors or things like that to deal with everything including that 

Recording: (1209/ 9621) 
that is just weird 

Recording: (1210/ 9621) 
yeah the ones that they really needed to do like two like seventy one and seventy i mean that that is a ball own neck area you know and they really should have done some of that twenty years ago you know 

Recording: (1211/ 9621) 
i think so he is he is not being forced to go in any direction that he is not ready for yeah i was going to college and and going to work and i mean i think that their personalities are different too though so he was very independent but i am not so sure that that is just his personality or if it was just he was adopting to his environment and where he was being put and being in day care from a very very young age and and then you know my youngest he is never been in day care at all so 

Recording: (1212/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1213/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1214/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1215/ 9621) 
yes but there is nobody home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured something weird had gone on i did not know what was going on but at the same time it was all divorce really did not just basically dumb because the entire was not going to phase me because the entire marriage was we knew we knew from the beginning that it was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable so we are just kind of waiting around going oh i going going to be there for you for a couple of months and sure enough so anyway um so i i look at these people and their names are the so they are coming forward with two police officers behind them and mister it is kind of a large tournament and he is way toooma for the experience and if you have to like be thatoma about something as stupid as a divorce i am going to give you some sort of shit for it and at the same time um this is used to be a principal of mine in elementary school 

Recording: (1216/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1217/ 9621) 
it is there always some notorist but 

Recording: (1218/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1219/ 9621) 
um i do some much just not one of them i just got back from lunch with i mean i see them 

Recording: (1220/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1221/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1222/ 9621) 
i think there is been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that and i really think it even though i would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking them away from the other the cousins i mean they the cousins have been stressing all along i mean he needs a family he needs a family well there is a much closer family than your father and it is it is a they love this country and this stuff well and accept the laws and follow them whether you agree with them or not uh i i i it was very unfortunate the way it happened i but i think the government should not have let it go on as long as they had 

Recording: (1223/ 9621) 
about uh thirteen years i think my dad uh once he got through with his residency and everything we moved to man isville and he joined to practice and we have been living there ever since um manfield is about i would say fifty five sixty thousand people and ashland is probably about twenty five to thirty thousand people but um man isfield is sort of fascinating per capita murder rate in man isfield is higher than anywhere else in in ohio um it is just it is very industrialized there is a there is a lot of um a certain community that lives there that normally would not live in a smaller city like that there is just a lot of there is a there and not really there is all sorts of there is all sorts of of of um industry in the mansard area but there is a lot of it no actually most of it most of it stayed most of it stayed it is been it is been there for a while yeah we have got the man isville state reformatory where shoshank red umpson was where shoshank red umpson was recorded yep yep well i do not know if that is our claim to fame but but we do we do have that in man isville but um ashland is a little bit more a little bit more of a matter of fact it is a lot lot more low key it is more of a it is more of a um agricultural county um ashean city is right where i live it is i mean we are like five minutes outside of ashean city but ashean city is a county seat for asheville county and um man isfield is the county seat for richland county yeah but everybody does everything in man isville because there is nothing to do in national but uh the man isfield was um oh yeah it was really boring it was really boring um my dad was just getting himself settled into the community and and with his job and everything my mom stayed home so she stayed with us for a while um most of my early childhood memories are from where where we lived in man isville it was uh it was a real it was a real do not talk do not ask community i mean you really did not know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi they never came over so yeah yeah yeah we lived in the suburban area of man isville sort of like the uh the the white collar area where all the people who were businessmen were getting themselves established so and then um we switched churches and also my dad opened up he he and his partner opened up another uh branch office in ashland so we moved to the ashland area about about eight years ago almost nine years ago and we moved to england to get halfway between um dad is my dad is now centrally located between the asheland office the hospital that is in asheland the hospitals that are in man isfield he is about uh he said it is about a twenty minute drive from all the places it needs to be yeah it is got a nice big house a barn some tractors no animals well we we have got a dog but but um it is it is a farm in the sense that we have got a barn we have got tractors we lease we lease some of the land out to uh a farmer who who actually works in plant stuffno not to be on a farm no my dad is a doctor 

Recording: (1224/ 9621) 
well that is competition to be earliest and the the federal government is trying to stay out of the state is face and so again it is another one of those things that just live with it i mean there is enough there is enough things to do in fight and worth life that that is not worth it you know 

Recording: (1225/ 9621) 
um but now see and i would never you know you do not know until you get a reaction like that 

Recording: (1226/ 9621) 
yeah i know we talk too long but this is so much fun 

Recording: (1227/ 9621) 
like they have this they have like two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens and like could you imagine like 

Recording: (1228/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1229/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1230/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (1231/ 9621) 
half tank gas 

Recording: (1232/ 9621) 
that is when you take him to grand mall like yeah that is what we do and he is got together great grand mall night that because we live with my mom and dad so he gets to see my sight all the time but he does not get to see them as much so it is like when that night comes on go go to grandma or like we take to him to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets uh those free tickets 

Recording: (1233/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1234/ 9621) 
do quite a do how to do it so that they can learn the other cultures and the other values but they just do not do any of them 

Recording: (1235/ 9621) 
no because i think there is the ideal in everything and if you can not live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now uh i mean i could never agree with abortion let us say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control issue became so personal and uh it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a what i thought was a clear conscience and what i did i do not have any regret for it what about you 

Recording: (1236/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1237/ 9621) 
well yeah it is i just give you a rough estimate of uh two and a half miles from here 

Recording: (1238/ 9621) 
well it is not that there is been too much growth i mean growth is good but now they need to stop 

Recording: (1239/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1240/ 9621) 
hey crime is is an is an interesting term um all rights laws many people were opposed to those but it was an an effort to correct years of institutionalized racist um and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime you know are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shd six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a a law on the book so i do not think we need to have a hate crime over and above that you know it the the the people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the uh affirmative action programs and the busting did that people is going to turn people against uh gays like that turn people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to yeah opening the schools in the south and i said for one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all white jury convict white been of of killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (1241/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1242/ 9621) 
and i suggest the shot the the death of probablyro because that is what i am on now and that way you do not miss any pills that last for three months you know and uh that is what i was suggesting for you know 

Recording: (1243/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1244/ 9621) 
i mean if we were that racist of a city then we would not be that accepting to gay pride marches and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back 

Recording: (1245/ 9621) 
we have the time 

Recording: (1246/ 9621) 
i do know a few people that are gay um but they are in their thirties 

Recording: (1247/ 9621) 
um not not cross dressing when they are when two men live together two women live together what do you call it 

Recording: (1248/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i have i have back problems or anything like that but it was just like the feeling it was like i am not right 

Recording: (1249/ 9621) 
it is so funny that is what my daughter is idea where we are going to down where i was looking at think hm there you could do yeah it is like 

Recording: (1250/ 9621) 
um yeah um-hum yeah 

Recording: (1251/ 9621) 
yeah he is not getting the i do not think he is getting not learning he is he is more uh that is his grandmother you know watching him and you know i wish that she would like do more of the learning things that the day cares do do you know but 

Recording: (1252/ 9621) 
it was uh part of the time 

Recording: (1253/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1254/ 9621) 
there was just something about that stink far better far more than a paddle a paddle was kind of a whop and then it was in that sort of thing it kind of got your attention when yourman you arethere is another warped uh that is okay that isthat is right right on the other side of the age war that that has still were right in movies and you have a right in the you have a right in the it is just murderers you know we were murderers now by that police bar that police bar and i think it was a whole thing that everyone was sat i do not think they should have seen any police bar and they will be some school ones and our people will get murdered atorappeals appeals 

Recording: (1255/ 9621) 
right right but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute you know it is so obvious hello but oh yeah 

Recording: (1256/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1257/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1258/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1259/ 9621) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the hunking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a a debate about it but it we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (1260/ 9621) 
and even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child the federal government still considered some half blood 

Recording: (1261/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1262/ 9621) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on um not colin bine but the one with the the younger kids in arkansas was it the before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere and colin pine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know their facts were all over the place but that is another kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the other students and and you know i am not in any way defending the guys who did it but um you know something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you know that you would even think of doing something like that um i do not know especially with you know everything that was said about the families and you know they did not seem to of course you never really know but they did not seem to have grown up in this you know terrible environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yeah i think a lot more effort needs to be made you know to sort of you know placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know the teachers are already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i do not know 

Recording: (1263/ 9621) 
okay we got real used well i 

Recording: (1264/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1265/ 9621) 
eighty eight so we just we just had our loved his wedding anniversary yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (1267/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1268/ 9621) 
yeah i think they are really helpful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it they are just really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want to stay home that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to her front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know i thought 

Recording: (1269/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so it is kind of like the small town thing which are has goods and bads but i do not know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with that still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple of years ago and a lot of participation in that and so 

Recording: (1270/ 9621) 
you can not take that away from me so uh you know like you said i think they just go through a lot of the stuff i mean i had a lot of uh animosity towards my dad per things that happen you know uh perhaps not being near when i was you know younger and stuff like that and uh if anything man my brother got closer because of it you know because he is three years older than me and then uh but but you know now you know i do not have they they are both out both my parents have passed away but uh you know i do not have any thing in lost i towards him at all you know i kind of like it is kind of like a growing up thing i i guess you know i mean you you kind of sit there and say hey you know you did the best you could you know i mean 

Recording: (1271/ 9621) 
is it often so similar to where i am coming from 

Recording: (1272/ 9621) 
that is a very strong animal and there is the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out and my opinion when that stuff happens when i see when i see someone light the horns of a bowl on fire and spain and tornado the bowl and then all of a sudden the bowl gets the flame put out and the bowl runs his leg and throws him around and picks them right near death i do not have any sympathy for them 

Recording: (1273/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1274/ 9621) 
you would be lost 

Recording: (1275/ 9621) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in virginia beach so 

Recording: (1276/ 9621) 
because i went to oregon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialist than they are capitalist and they are easier to deal with than they are more reasonable people in my opinion much more reasonable but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and and all i am the minority in my family believe me and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1277/ 9621) 
does that mean 

Recording: (1278/ 9621) 
and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in the plumber is coated fabric plant which is a plant that makes oh coated fabrics they make uh the main thing is the auto upholstrate car upholstrate anyway they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out and their fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (1279/ 9621) 
i do not know i i i do not know if it was drugs or something ridiculous and they there is a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force and a lot of other officials are are pretty much in agreement that he should resign and he feels like like he is just not going to and that we do not have any um the the mayor can not nobody can actually make him resign that that is something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as you know do not have to was peter was saying i am going to make him do this which is something that she does not have any power to do um and that and and about how how they just continue to get raises and they are and they are not doing very much about it and and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police cards and and a lot of people are are doing dust jobs and those types of things and i i guess a lot of people just are not very happy with the job he is been doing 

Recording: (1280/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1281/ 9621) 
well and and the ambiguous part of it you know just say and try to be protective of the ways 

Recording: (1282/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1283/ 9621) 
because of the gay activity 

Recording: (1284/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1285/ 9621) 
um he moved to texas because like he was moving into the like he was going to smu there and like so i moved back from florida back to up up here because i did not want to i do not want to go with texas texas texas is terrible and like um so then like my mom she like my parents got divorced when i was like five or something and so 

Recording: (1286/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1287/ 9621) 
since march too 

Recording: (1288/ 9621) 
it is a couple miles 

Recording: (1289/ 9621) 
yeah so it it she is funny because she is gained twenty six pounds and it she does not look pregnant she has on she had on a regular sweater today 

Recording: (1290/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1291/ 9621) 
right now but i knew him when he was eight ten months over and he worked every day 

Recording: (1292/ 9621) 
i have never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women are not precious is because they do not show any kind of a spiritual leadership i i have never heard that said and so there must be people who think that 

Recording: (1293/ 9621) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (1294/ 9621) 
but they just do not have those 

Recording: (1295/ 9621) 
you know his work building and i am like there is no history in america you know 

Recording: (1296/ 9621) 
redden because i do not know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and yeah i was called i have little things 

Recording: (1297/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (1298/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1299/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah like i knew uh like a lot of people who who lived down on campus i used to live down on hudson like over the summer before i went to issue um so i mean i like campus and everything it is just like oh she was different than campus yeah 

Recording: (1300/ 9621) 
but if you love if you love someone you want them to do what is right and you want them to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also in other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i am not going to let get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that dear but i love you dearly but i tried to teach you different i do not know where you went wrong i do not want to do it wrong but you got to pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the line somewhere uh but now you said family yes i think the reason that at our age we look back everyone was born and everyone was loved by a father my when they were little and how their former tv is are and the education the uh the way they were uh taught as they were growing up does help them to become what that president is what that any politician is any minister or anybody else it the way you are raised i firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it it it bears on everybody so that is why it really begins with the family 

Recording: (1301/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of you know america just being like the country of access like access positions access food access money you know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back and you know this i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of manland europe and everything and i come back and you know where my parents live there were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know this like giant kmart land you know i mean it just was so overwhelming even though obviously i would grown up with you know america my whole life and you know not that i sort of changed completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernus places and like just the other day my friend took me to eastern and i mean you walk in there and i do not feel like i am in columbus you know i feel like uh it is got to be california or something just because it is just 

Recording: (1302/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1303/ 9621) 
no and she said you know and and the the last three or four years she just wrote it out so she could retire and she is be a very dedicated uh very dedicated teacher and she just it was a job then and it is a hate to see that happen to good teachers 

Recording: (1304/ 9621) 
if you do not make a child support payment they should do the same thing i do not know why they do not have a system like that 

Recording: (1305/ 9621) 
so the state would pay for it 

Recording: (1306/ 9621) 
um when i went i went with my friend 

Recording: (1307/ 9621) 
and she said she would get back to me on it well i have never heard nothing from her and she is done that to me i do not know how many times 

Recording: (1308/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1309/ 9621) 
oh yeah that is beautiful yeah 

Recording: (1310/ 9621) 
i think they would have a bigger problem with it yeah 

Recording: (1311/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (1312/ 9621) 
but most of the time like i try and uh like most of the time it is pretty easy i guess pretty straight forward sometimes it is really aggravating when 

Recording: (1313/ 9621) 
uh that is not true i mean uh some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes um 

Recording: (1314/ 9621) 
um i go to north when i school right now 

Recording: (1315/ 9621) 
i do not go to city center too much although i like it being there if i want to go to it 

Recording: (1316/ 9621) 
no because i have a stigmatatism because i you know the glass is cut in right here and that is irritating 

Recording: (1317/ 9621) 
no my mom is uh she is not embe uh she is seventy two years old but they go out usually to yard sales and stuff like that stuff i do not want to do 

Recording: (1318/ 9621) 
yes you are right 

Recording: (1319/ 9621) 
okay oh okay so 

Recording: (1320/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1321/ 9621) 
oh yeah and i i will probably step on your toes here but i i i am not a firm believer of mom and dad both working i my wife worked until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked at a school so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was at home and you know my parents did not do that and i hated it i hated coming home from school by myself every day there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and and i just feel that you know i i hope you do not have children yet do you good because to me parents who put kids in day care and uh you know after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs i get up in the morning and i feed my pet my child then i put him in the kennel and i go to work and i go gee i like to go for some drinks after work or go to movie we will just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go we will be back a little bit and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 

Recording: (1322/ 9621) 
so be it you know we had the ribbers out there helping out the the gi is fine team effort was not it but then after ti is came home the little a went back into the house and business all these idle lines and hey we can do something here because those days little a little a job you know we want to learn to think mom would do a up a little extra things here and so forth that was the primary bread winner but she got on this odd jobs just to compliment their needs for that budget they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it they did not go out and spend on credit i mean i am trying to have myself here but business said hey let us produce these lines little later you are a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 

Recording: (1323/ 9621) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emily in the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten harvard and then start you know try to make it up by working harder you get the actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you know 

Recording: (1324/ 9621) 
yeah and we are one of them taxes is just important strong they have like 

Recording: (1325/ 9621) 
i am come home and get in the car and go out go somewhere you know or come home and get something to eat and and uh and it uh but i think that has a lot to do with it uh i do not really know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid watching how he did you know that stuff and course it was not the uh buying the stuff maybe you can see on tv now or uh but i do not really think the media is has had that much to do with it it is just a different time now i i mean i remember uh one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know with a a the vietnamese guy a vietnam guy getting his brain blown out on national tv you know and uh uh that did not make me go out or do that you know so if anything it made me want to not want to do it you know because my brother was in was in vietnam he was in the army and uh when i got my notice he is like three years older and me you know he said hey do not let him dress you they will put you on the front line i said well i am going to a list in the air force anyway so 

Recording: (1326/ 9621) 
oh it was it was easy 

Recording: (1327/ 9621) 
uh he was a uh railroad clerk 

Recording: (1328/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (1329/ 9621) 
and i am really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me though it is like oh you come on i do not really want i do not want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff i just want to get going and do the rest of the stuff so 

Recording: (1330/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1331/ 9621) 
believe it god 

Recording: (1332/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (1333/ 9621) 
so therefore they can they are not public they can put whatever they want 

Recording: (1334/ 9621) 
oh i see but i do not i guess from a career perspective they say it is not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but 

Recording: (1335/ 9621) 
um so i just can not down here then 

Recording: (1336/ 9621) 
really and people use do people use them 

Recording: (1337/ 9621) 
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if i slept at night instead of staying up 

Recording: (1338/ 9621) 
uh my my sister is particularly religious and that that tends to warper her view of everything 

Recording: (1339/ 9621) 
right well here is here is a can of sandwich it is a dollar fifty and we will give you fifty cents off well gee if i just use the recipe out of the microwave cookbook i can make it home for like three cents but but you know why it is convenience i can throw it in the microwave and it will be done in five minutes you know like mashed potatoes and microwave or you know it is like hello it is you know i i can understand how people do it because they come home from work and it is like i do not want to be a cook i do not want to be a cleanup so i will pay somebody to do this pay somebody to do that and pretty soon you see all the money that they have been making gone 

Recording: (1340/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1341/ 9621) 
and the um that was part of the process there to how to work work and work up there too with people but if we could just share more 

Recording: (1342/ 9621) 
because i have seen things that are not physically possible 

Recording: (1343/ 9621) 
you wereyou had to go home because mother was ill 

Recording: (1344/ 9621) 
yeah it is it is nice i think so well 

Recording: (1345/ 9621) 
i believe 

Recording: (1346/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (1347/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (1348/ 9621) 
uh to we never use the word ever but um i am sure playing people use the word on us you know but we try we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but um in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a matriarchie one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would have to go with her you know but uh if uh if uh we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would very and i then in the year that i lived in that community was one of the best years of my life uh was 

Recording: (1349/ 9621) 
yeah yeah there is a big water area it is something to do with the little mermaid or whatever but they really enjoy all that we try to do as much as we can with them outdoor type of thing we do a lot of camping we do a lot of vacationing we try to go to ice a year at least uh her parents live in cape cod so they

we start more again they have never learned and the reason why you are throwing a care out too much in front of us saying hey you got to do this to prove this to me no we we we black a one heck of a lot of ethical moral standards in this country were losing every day until we start looking ourselves in in the mirror at night and saying yeah i am sorry myself i am probably why i did i may not uh may a dollar a day but i understood somebody a day 

Recording: (1351/ 9621) 
i thought it was very strange but um 

Recording: (1352/ 9621)

Recording: (1356/ 9621) 
like 

Recording: (1357/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (1358/ 9621) 
well uh a long time ago uh when they had signed a decoration and everything they said you know build a fence around your place and and take care of your own you know and i think basically that is the way the philosophy should be i think there is times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman uh 

Recording: (1359/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1360/ 9621) 
right well the most people do not like to hear uh relatives and stuff i am taking a year off 

Recording: (1361/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1362/ 9621) 
i am sorry yes 

Recording: (1363/ 9621) 
i mean not saying that they had to believe what we believe but just even just their attitude about life was so down and 

Recording: (1364/ 9621) 
now this pokey now that the pokey mom you know all in there but you know i i heard somebody somewhere say my five year old could name all hundred and fifty pokey mom characters but could not tell you his phone number and and that is true with mine 

Recording: (1365/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1366/ 9621) 
in any pregnancy three weeks in either direction is considered full term 

Recording: (1367/ 9621) 
yeah i i am surprised they are not getting a lot of heat from that but because that works been there forever 

Recording: (1368/ 9621) 
that is that is going to be a problem they said bring bring water you are going to definitely like they have no dress code which is nice so i am just going to wear shorts some good walking shoes and a and a tshirt because it could get rough it could get real rough i bet 

Recording: (1369/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1370/ 9621) 
yeah well i did not realize that to i had kids 

Recording: (1371/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1372/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure nineteen i was seeing some really bizarre things too uh but you can tell that he is thought about it 

Recording: (1373/ 9621) 
all right number one none of them had a the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted when they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car or they had their car they were not allowed to have my car and take it and run over to this kid is house or that kid is 

Recording: (1374/ 9621) 
but he first started out i liked him he had on sensible things simon and all those what we are talking about now i think sometimes but he and where to keep up with uh uh i can not remember all the names of their shows that i do not watch them i am doing oh uproar one of them and all those other people it is just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done and all that malarkey and i think he decided he had to do anything on his program or for him to keep his ratings up so you know i i see that is what you mean by getting into what this person does over here and that is another thing when you teach your kids because john doe jane doe is doing it does not mean that is right have the courage to be yourself and say no some people might think you are terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (1375/ 9621) 
and they they say that is a city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like sixty thousand 

Recording: (1376/ 9621) 
you know and these schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand excuse me people and just to try to monitor different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know and checking everything and 

Recording: (1377/ 9621) 
yeah i live in uh subaru 

Recording: (1378/ 9621) 
and they used to have the laser lake show downtown but they do not have anymore um you know just even if you do one thing for you a month 

Recording: (1379/ 9621) 
you know you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you work two two hours a day you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so 

Recording: (1380/ 9621) 
well i think people that made that ball should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (1381/ 9621) 
and i hand it again out uh in other ones it is it is a struggle with that thing and understanding it takes time to understand it a lot of people a lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it um i was trying to let the fear of that um well i am not afraid to die i am afraid sometimes that i will die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was sitting here to do which is just the basic things fall in love with some money have children raise them 

Recording: (1382/ 9621) 
uh-huh me too years ago 

Recording: (1383/ 9621) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are one of them one of them particularly is i think in good moral good sort of guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but i i really think that they are both good and uh see 

Recording: (1384/ 9621) 
well i work i work parttime kind of because uh i worked full time when he was you know one and i did not know i felt like um the babysitters or you know whoever saw him more than i did and that because i love my son more than anything in the world and i felt like he needed me you know so i went down a part time and i am struggling more but i rather see my son have me you know 

Recording: (1385/ 9621) 
uh-huh i moved just to vis moved into uh uh up by one sixty one cle a lot and they say also hassle hassle hassle but down here even with the kids and everything going to school but basically it is kind of laid back uh or up there it is all go go go uh 

Recording: (1386/ 9621) 
well it is harder than i think in in some ways than people think um i went to the teach ohio fair last year to look around and did not see that much interest in in uh chemistry or general science teachers um i think the market is is fluctuated back to a point where they do not need as many right now they are not clamering for us um-hum 

Recording: (1387/ 9621) 
is it really 

Recording: (1388/ 9621) 
i think people are still fairly racist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other rich relations fault um i mean as far as like if you look at the black community and things like that you have like beetee um you have like the united states college fund things like that where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not giving out equal opportunity of the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing what people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whatnot um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1389/ 9621) 
where that nice mall is and um someone smith which is outside of atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff 

Recording: (1390/ 9621) 
but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (1391/ 9621) 
i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (1392/ 9621) 
i think later on when he gets a little older he will be you know 

Recording: (1393/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1394/ 9621) 
what you did 

Recording: (1395/ 9621) 
oh i am sure 

Recording: (1396/ 9621) 
it is not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway it is that um the homes are worth more because of the school system 

Recording: (1397/ 9621) 
definitely definitely 

Recording: (1398/ 9621) 
oh it has you know your basic uh laderous which i like to go to laderous and sears and jc penney is and uh no i would not want to drive to polyester is to go to those stores but if they made some outlets over there you know i i would be happy with that uh there is just a lot of smaller stores you know like victoria secrets and book stores and toy stores and athletic wear stores um a lot of those i do not even go to get some key off set up outside you know with the little curse with different little things they sell just like your basic kind of mall 

Recording: (1399/ 9621) 
put it through a prison and you know you pack it full when you had a gun 

Recording: (1400/ 9621)

Recording: (1410/ 9621) 
yeah it is going to have to be from the bottom up i and everybody keeps and i i am just getting a kick out of all the investments and everything they are coming with two thousand on it well i am hoping people are making a big deal and making a big investment in selling a lot of stuff because of it but i am hoping that it does mean since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope uh y2k i do not know what that really stands for i have to think of some words there but you know it is since everybody is just making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal you know 

Recording: (1411/ 9621) 
when i got here but i was in one of those you know used stupid uh psychiatric relationships shall we say and i kind of needed to to disappear and um we never told him where she she had just moved

Recording: (1417/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1418/ 9621) 
yeah and and a lot of performing arts you were expected to take something in performing or visual arts every year which um which was good for him the the catholic school he was going to go to was big on sports and my son is not athletic and so this is that is why he did not want to go this is a this is a good choice for him for that yeahyeah uh yeah well uhyeah well um i think the teachers are every bit as good as dedicated but i think there seems to be um the whole administration up through the board and just it it is not as focused you know i do not know how it is going it is like the teachers are just sort of it seems like they almost have the feeling they are on their own where it is more coherent within the catholic school it seems like it seems to be very clear they are all going in the same direction and working as a team uh i do not know have you ever listened to any of the uh columbus board of education meetings or on the radio 

Recording: (1419/ 9621) 
and i heard the thing you know you are not my real father and all that we want to do all that 

Recording: (1420/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (1421/ 9621)

Recording: (1426/ 9621) 
yeah well looking at me oh you want a dollar more you know and they are making thousands um but yeah i do not want to do that anymore i want to go somewhere i have got somebody helping me kind of you know um just an acquaintance of mine um that is kind of a head hunter and i have given him the idea that i want to either work for an attorney that is going to make some changes or you know do something that way i have got a lot of administration you know and and manager and things like that background so i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also accomplishing something that is what i am going to do i have not found it yet i have got an interview with a radio station though and that is kind of 

Recording: (1427/ 9621) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (1428/ 9621) 
oh yeah it was like whoa my head was like oh i got to figure out how to do that it was like you can not do that i thought yeah he he broke into like oh my god i can not remember what it was but he had all these numbers for credit cards and he was threatened to to sell them on the internet 

Recording: (1429/ 9621) 
no because i know people that are married do not take care of their kids 

Recording: (1430/ 9621) 
yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon and i always the dored mark half filled i did not vote for him though because i thought he was a great republican andwell but i think personally my coleman was good i i have met uh well we had a diamond jewelry at village and and coleman and peter both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i did not think that there was much that much difference in them idealologically i think you know she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but um i in terms of having a black mirror i think that is good for columbus i think 

Recording: (1431/ 9621) 
um-hum enjoy them now you get the terrible trees that go through which is which is cool and uh i remember one time when we got in a big argument one time when she uh when she turned a teenager and uh i called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and i said there said well you know i am calling long distance she goes so i am talking to my girlfriend i said so what hang up on her car back 

Recording: (1432/ 9621) 
oh okay okay um-hum um-hum um-hum my brother my older brother lived in bloomington for a while and he ran a music store on the square in the center of town and might have just been called blooming and music i am not sure he sold guitars and things on the square right across from the court house yeah yeah 

Recording: (1433/ 9621) 
so that i think that is a problem too you know everybody says well i do not want to get there at eight thirty you know so 

Recording: (1434/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1435/ 9621) 
yeah he is a father 

Recording: (1436/ 9621) 
it is like big deal you know common sense to hot you do not put it in a sensitive area while you are driving to work um but she sued for ten million and the paper said she won ten million she did not i mean after that ten million award was given by a jury then uh mcdonald is allowed an appeal at the end of a year so she does not see any money for a year and that is if they do not appeal but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1437/ 9621) 
i was uh it was it was interesting i mean it is it is so it is a lot it is hard to remember a lot of terminology but i enjoyed it 

Recording: (1438/ 9621) 
typical dorm 

Recording: (1439/ 9621) 
um that is probably when he started yeah um 

Recording: (1440/ 9621) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come i am a christian so i believe that homosexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not going to condend them um at all like i said i have friends it i understand what you are saying um but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out maybe that child um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a thirty student ensemble um it would be nice if we had more of an open environment schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talked to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way um just because if you are going to teach it to a a large amount of students i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them would probably be making cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (1441/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (1442/ 9621) 
oh gore really does not entice me at all he claimed you invented the internet 

Recording: (1443/ 9621) 
um i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun we will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their hands on guns they are basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them 

Recording: (1444/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (1445/ 9621) 
no not really um all my good friends from well i would say like out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two of them are still here 

Recording: (1446/ 9621) 
well i what what what neighborhood do you live in because i you know i see asians and indians and all come everywhere but boy they do not live on my street 

Recording: (1447/ 9621) 
uh my stepmother is 

Recording: (1448/ 9621) 
yeah you know that is that is the thing so i think just being aware and then also like i said with with all the i mean and i am and i am self opinionated in this too anybody that knows me i look at all the advertising i look at the advertising and i look through i i see lazers and i see coles and i see sears you look through and you say oh okay you know you are looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole two pages of women in braves and they are looking at the camera they are seduct looking at the camera and you are like okay how many how many different braves do women really need that is not for the women i am sorry you know most women by the time they are buying braves know what choices they have you know they do not need all that but then it is funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men the men is heads are usually cut off they are not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all i mean it is just so uneven so we leave these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up we push all this in the you know and then expect them to deal with it you know and they see tv shows and and everything else that you know it is okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she is you know i mean i think it is what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and and what we are allowed to to show our kids you know you get involved in the free speech and that is fine but wait till those kids grow up and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech gets mugged or you know anything else happens to them 

Recording: (1449/ 9621) 
not they actually are going through it you know to me it was to her but the aftermath basically you know you just 

Recording: (1450/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1451/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1452/ 9621) 
i mean actually run over and killed 

Recording: (1453/ 9621) 
um-hum mobile it is it is a lot of work really is she is a a nurse and she works at the medical center in the breast cancer department she is uh oh earner is she is worked here for twenty two years also got her degree at ohio state she grew up in dayton and then moved here to go to college and then stayed at ohio state after college 

Recording: (1454/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1455/ 9621) 
he can eat fresh water 

Recording: (1456/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1457/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (1458/ 9621) 
ah i 

Recording: (1459/ 9621) 
i did i did 

Recording: (1460/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1461/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1462/ 9621) 
so that is you know they a lot of my decisions were based upon that 

Recording: (1463/ 9621) 
um but you know i think what they did was fairly good they did not really as far as i remember at that point at least they did not well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue um but i what i remember was more of a scientific approach 

Recording: (1464/ 9621) 
for amc is for um not getting hurt she works at fed ex and um her crew is always getting hurt mainly her 

Recording: (1465/ 9621) 
first area second quarter 

Recording: (1466/ 9621) 
no no but hopefully when they do get the one strike somebody i say somebody because right now i do not really think we have that in place but we would need more of a um one strike stepping stone you know and i let us face it counseling is probably not going to work uh and somebody in that it would almost take um i do personally know people that go into that type of environment here in columbus and actually work with the families and work with the kids and actually are in there living there showing them you know it is it is one thing to go help them and then leave that and go home to your nice house i do not i admit it i could not do it but uh if if people really did things like that i think they would be helped for them because they are actually friends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all initially but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save half of them it is better than than anything 

Recording: (1467/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1468/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1469/ 9621) 
she is okay right 

Recording: (1470/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1471/ 9621) 
well it was both really because there is the kids lived there since i lived there and that was thirteen years ago and being that long in the same neighborhood just does not really get it with me 

Recording: (1472/ 9621) 
no not often uh my daughter has a very uh intense life and uh so uh i do not see them near as often as i like well we just do a one day thing because it is fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go real early in the morning and uh spend six or seven hours with them and then come back and or she does the same thing she comes down here and we just do the one day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah you know so it is better just to so i know what they are doing and everything but i do not i am not old fashioned grandmother 

Recording: (1473/ 9621) 
i guess 

Recording: (1474/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1475/ 9621) 
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that had not been kept up 

Recording: (1476/ 9621) 
yeah are they going to change that 

Recording: (1477/ 9621) 
um they did briefly like cover things like that with like religion and health classes things like that 

Recording: (1478/ 9621) 
it is been it is been remarkably well i mean i have not had any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and and i had a check up and my doctor really thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultra sound well the thing is they did this ultra sound they did not find anything so which was really kind of creepy because they did not know because there is that whole two full pregnancy thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did my altrushown was not my regular doctor and he is kind of well he he is just a little abroad for me and he says well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you could die at all this is the way to but i said you know i said die already for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is going really wild i mean i just i and i know we just finished our little math classes last night and there was some woman in there they are huge i mean these girls can not even get off the floor and i just feel really bad for them so for me it is it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems 

Recording: (1479/ 9621) 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh not so much uh the the type of work that i do but i think she is very i think very giveable very giving very uh 

Recording: (1480/ 9621) 
well i do think access is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just besides themselves but it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be you know doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that obviously england is such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me and but it is true i mean the fact that you know the access is just there is almost nothing barred and i mean just the amount of people that i just hear sort of you know in conversation talking about oh yeah you know getting a gun for security and all this stuff it is like you know your chances of number one needing it and number two if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chance that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (1481/ 9621) 
why i do not know it does not make sense 

Recording: (1482/ 9621)

Recording: (1483/ 9621) 
well you know my and my girls there are certain products that brand name like uh one of them i know is the myer uh pudding that you can uh take to for lunches which they do and it is like adventure you know adventure but adventure well every once in a while hunts will be the same price and they will be a coupon in the paper so choice will always always try we we trade she goes to grocery store once then next two weeks i go and then next two weeks she goes so uh she will you know she will buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes and i go why are you buying that and she goes it was cheaper than the myrtle and then when we eat it it is like it is too sweet you know or it is too overpowering or too sugary and the girls even think it is the same way they we go we do not like this it is two chocolatey so you know like the sandwich stuff it is like they just pour sugar in it i guess because that is what people like and so i find that the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but it is all like a myr brand or something like that or food club or something like that 

Recording: (1484/ 9621)

Recording: (1486/ 9621) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know because i guess that is because that is what happens to a lot of them you know they they come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make upper management you there is you want the tax break you want the thing you know what i mean and then the like i have an uncle he is a vice president of wall street from mary lynch and he said you know he he got out of school is very idealistic but now he he he is like all those people they should you know i i made it through myself and it is not for like the you know but realistically he did not but

Recording: (1493/ 9621) 
yeah or you could do the university of oregon it is very nice very small university but it is nice 

Recording: (1494/ 9621)

Recording: (1495/ 9621) 
when i first you know got a divorce so it is been hard 

Recording: (1496/ 9621) 
that once you filter it three something it looks different but previous to it yeah there is a lot there there is way too much shared experience to to go off over effectively so when she said look if you are never listening to anything else that i say you will listen to this you need to go to europe it is like okay i will go to europe 

Recording: (1497/ 9621) 
which i had a conversation with her about and said you know you did not cause anything you know i mean your mother calls at all and if anything you were the price part of the whole merit so that is where you got to look yourself when you see that reflection in the mirror in the mirror and remember the you know 

Recording: (1498/ 9621) 
texuality yeah 

Recording: (1499/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1500/ 9621)

Recording: (1501/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1502/ 9621) 
where northland is 

Recording: (1503/ 9621) 
oh it will be 

Recording: (1504/ 9621) 
no because um all the kids take that california achievement test on if you are familiar with that and it is like you know because it is say like you and i go to school you go to you go to double and and i go to the worst school in columbus and we both make straight as well when you take the california achievement test that really the a is mean nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned the score on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really scored especially high on those because you know they always pick on columbus public schools they go oh it is so look how bad their test scores well you know if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i do not know what it would be but let us just say it is a brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad in probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there or in prison so they live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not a uh you know a an oger or anything but you know i always keep tabs on my kids you know like i have always gone to conferences even though they got straight a is i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like saying i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keeping tabs on things and i do not demand a is i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is to see then that is what it will be but i said if your best is to me to get to see you get me to talk to so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight a is and when they take the um what does that thing the profancy test zoom through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have uh this this probably sounds really biased or bigoted but then you have the kid whose mom and dad are not together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes a profession test he gets like a 

Recording: (1505/ 9621) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all right how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they did not know i was going to do this so after they got all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff i bring in my bread my peanut butter my jelly and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no ad living no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote 

Recording: (1506/ 9621) 
and then on the other coach instead either 

Recording: (1507/ 9621) 
you played saxophone in the band 

Recording: (1508/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (1509/ 9621) 
they are pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i am not sure what the address is right now 

Recording: (1510/ 9621) 
i my my kids went to a school that well my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in the other frame and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeah once it is reached the point that the decision is made and announced and they never good reasons for it uh and explain the reasons and you know at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when it is inevitable 

Recording: (1511/ 9621) 
to mustiness the old 

Recording: (1512/ 9621) 
every kid and my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or another 

Recording: (1513/ 9621) 
you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (1514/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1515/ 9621) 
because the larger story was too much to film in one one movie but this one as a as a as a part of a whole i i am preserving complete judgment until 

Recording: (1516/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (1517/ 9621) 
as uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were 

Recording: (1518/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1519/ 9621) 
she is already i do not think she would have it any other ways 

Recording: (1520/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1521/ 9621) 
oh last year is one of them yeah along that line 

Recording: (1522/ 9621) 
even if they do not pay me it is going to be fun 

Recording: (1523/ 9621) 
i say you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 

Recording: (1524/ 9621) 
yeah it is like um i do not know they used to have something called their spring post that were directly related and then um venturing kind of took over for that like it is still in boy scouts and then explaining one off on its own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they allow like homosexual reality with uh leaders and all that so it is i do not know we call it like hippie boy scouts 

Recording: (1525/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1526/ 9621) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kids going to hate you 

Recording: (1527/ 9621) 
we had uh counter battery fire we called up which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was kind of scary uh we were in positions where we could fire on a a uh tank battle that was going on we had a forward observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i do not know how many tanks they claimed that we hit but 

Recording: (1528/ 9621) 
and so it was kind of funny but but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (1529/ 9621) 
child abuse 

Recording: (1530/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1531/ 9621) 
oh george oh do not you i do not know i have not really formed an opinion i can not 

Recording: (1532/ 9621)

Recording: (1533/ 9621) 
yeah my sister and her husband just moved back they went out to nebraska for a year

Recording: (1537/ 9621) 
yeah they will not bother it 

Recording: (1538/ 9621) 
you said we are their government or something government stays out of things that is our problem government is in too too many things they need to be out of your nose that is your personal business they need to be out of your business 

Recording: (1539/ 9621) 
i just think it is sad even hearing climates you know like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools and i thought you know i just you know it just because of all the things you have seen in the world in the last year that these kids want to do that is just to see what is going to happen 

Recording: (1540/ 9621) 
now what that is industry are new crimes or something like that well think about it now you have got the wet ones down there you know where kids are going to go 

Recording: (1541/ 9621) 
tiger falls 

Recording: (1542/ 9621) 
okay i was born in dayton ohio i lived there almost thirty five years before moving to columbus in nineteen eighty one uh lived in uh northwest columbus for eighteen years uh moved last january a little farther west about five miles further west near hillwood but still live in the city of columbus uh so i have been here about eighteen nineteen years i like columbus also i think it is a great city although the last three months i have threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction you just can not get anywhere very frustrating uh but other than that columbia is a great city um i went to this is something different about me most people do not know that uh it it existed in the the twentieth century but i went to an all girl catholic school for twelve years uh so there there are no boys and i was not in a classroom with boys until i got to college uh i went to college at right state university uh my parents could not afford to send me so i had to work two years in high school two years after high school to pay my way through college um and taught school for about eight and a half nine years and during that time got my master is degree in remedial reading um taught for i think i said there is about eight and a half nine years and my life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teacher is association or teacher is union and that led to a job in political action because i would always been active in politics from high school on uh the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in nineteen sixty as a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status uh several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from uh but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union did that for a couple of years till i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts um did that that is kind of stressful um so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that and um i am never been married did not plan that that was not a goal in life it just never occurred uh so i have no kids but i have a pet and now i am uh i call myself semi retired i get a small you know monthly retirement and then i supplement my income by doing things like this i am an independent contractor i do training i do um different thing you know where people get my opinion i have done a couple of um thing with uh lawyers looking you know they do like mock trials on real issues and then you listen to all of the stuff and then you you know pretend that you are a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case and to going into court so that is fun so that is a little bit about me i would say my family my mom and dad um well i am um my mother was first generation american my grandparents came to this country from hungary and that was a neat experience i like growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant and hungry uh and he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do also he always voted so you know i learned it in early age that it is important to vote um my mom and dad were both alcoholics um i have two brothers no sisters one older than me one younger than me um and i have no children but i have a pet that is my child and i always say pets are uh children you raise pets you spoil so my my pet is very 

Recording: (1543/ 9621) 
he went to columbia schools uh and the kid did not know what he had he just found laying around his his father is car in the golf compartment brought it into show to the other kids uh that was very upsetting to my son he was very sensitive uh he used to be again i do not know if that is normal for teenagers or not but he used to used to be very sensitive to other people and but uh i do not think i i do not know if he is or he just does not will not let him beat somebody right now but 

Recording: (1544/ 9621) 
that is funny 

Recording: (1545/ 9621) 
they have to get a larger police department to do that that is another thing the city has grown so much that we do not have adequate protection i do not think anymore 

Recording: (1546/ 9621) 
thats right there is a well it does not work that 

Recording: (1547/ 9621) 
i have been back there for about ten ten years um i would like to move back down there but there just is not any work you know unless you own your own company so and that basically is remodeling drywall and stuff like that 

Recording: (1548/ 9621) 
yeah that was the most somebody could be um ordered to pay being unemployed 

Recording: (1549/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1550/ 9621) 
yeah it basically feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes but exorbitantly high i it is a little higher but you know it it is not ridiculously high 

Recording: (1551/ 9621) 
they ai not going to lock me up 

Recording: (1552/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (1553/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1554/ 9621) 
no i would be taking in foster kid i i raised a little boy from the time he was born till he was six well he was my friend she is a single woman and she wanted to adopt but she said you would not adopt if she was he was going to have to a child would have to go to day care and this was when my daughter was started kindergarten and i said if you get a baby i will take care of him till he starts school 

Recording: (1555/ 9621) 
you can see the housing trends and there there again it goes back to the stupid consumer i say stupid consumer because when i was in college i always said well the consumer had a fourth grade education level 

Recording: (1556/ 9621) 
just for the courses that i need 

Recording: (1557/ 9621) 
who knows 

Recording: (1558/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1559/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1560/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1561/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1562/ 9621) 
yeah i just like doing it and i have a good i have my my best friend is done is in and and because i live in the area and so she would say oh i do not know and she would say well how much do you have to get it for it how much and i would say oh i do not know i think if i get it for under a hundred or five i probably can sell it for a hundred and forty five to this distance now you are going to put a lot of money into that though it is not like you are you are still going to make me ten thousand dollars profit but um and she would say well i do not know for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea and finally she says oh very i do not know it always works out for you you always get that so just do it and it is just some tuition kind of thing 

Recording: (1563/ 9621) 
like it is like we are taking catalog words over the phone and it is not really a big deal like they are not seeing how we are dressed at all i mean they tell us we just wear college shirts and stuff but nobody does like they do not really enforce it and they too they yell at like knives like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we could not hug and they were like no that is like you can not hug in here or something like that you know like it it takes away from the attitude like i do not even know what to say to people like that like this is like such a different like 

Recording: (1564/ 9621) 
no they are all 

Recording: (1565/ 9621) 
i think that would be perfect 

Recording: (1566/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1567/ 9621) 
i i used to kind of worry about the effect that tv had on me um i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv i would come home from school and plot myself in front of the tv and watch uh like you know four cartoons back to back or so every day after school or i that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be a a block of you know from six in the morning until afternoon or something these days i do not watch nearly that much tv um i do not buy these arguments that people make that say that like children are like like the violence in tv as affecting children i mean i i have seen some evidence of of exercises where in schools like kids will watch a like a a violent cartoon like i do not know like road runner or something and then be a little ruffer but i i do not think that it it goes into like values i do not associate like rise in crime or something with uh like crime on tv or something i mean mean if there is a correlation i mean uh i am more of the you know like parents have a greater influence on the children than tv ever could i mean i watch watch a lot of tv but i feel that my parents taught me was right and wrong and i watched a lot of rather violent tv violent movies all that kind of thing and uh 

Recording: (1568/ 9621) 
i remember mcuffy lane i do not know if you know who they are yeah 

Recording: (1569/ 9621) 
no not my area not my area if it is hot in here 

Recording: (1570/ 9621) 
oh yeah there is always people out there 

Recording: (1571/ 9621)

Recording: (1572/ 9621) 
so that means you are a good problem solving you are a good logical thinker you are good in science you are good in math you know so there is a few things you are not good at does not mean you are stupid you know i would much rather be stranded on an island with six 

Recording: (1573/ 9621) 
you know we we really do not know much about his life away you know away from home 

Recording: (1574/ 9621) 
they cannot understand where you are coming from 

Recording: (1575/ 9621)

because it is hard being the only girl in the house 

Recording: (1577/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (1578/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1579/ 9621) 
yeah i think i think they fly to omaha so it is not too bad that is pretty easy to get into 

Recording: (1580/ 9621) 
and you know as with a lot of the resentment that is felt that i experienced toward americans you know rather suddenly i think our culture is starting to really influence itself into europe at least i mean i see instead of us becoming more like them you know them becoming more like us walmart has bought you know a big uh retailer there so 

Recording: (1581/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1582/ 9621)

Recording: (1607/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1608/ 9621)

Recording: (1611/ 9621) 
than highly critical of of organized religion 

Recording: (1612/ 9621) 
no no i mean it is kind of a traditional light at the um like a big tenor was up right light at the end or they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene um seeing a dad relative something like that 

Recording: (1613/ 9621) 
but she is doing fine uh she was dating somebody i do not know whether they really got married or not you know because i do not really have that much communication with her with some guy younger than her and i talked to him he is saying like pretty decent guy you know 

Recording: (1614/ 9621) 
course my wife is worked in higher education for thirty years so 

Recording: (1615/ 9621) 
she could not understand except the fact that you could just disagree with her it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or you could not just disagree had to be a reason there but fortunately she accused me that in front of my boss who was black who did not believe it he knew better so 

Recording: (1616/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1617/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1618/ 9621) 
yeah there there were troubled kids in the past who had no backgrounds in it 

Recording: (1619/ 9621) 
until they start getting a little bit better equipment because the equipment is really ancient i mean there is stuff there that is older than i am you know so but they like uh poor coming along with the new tower when they are it is supposed to be done in about three and a half years and the equipment they are getting is all brand new stuff it is not like they are taking all the old junk we have got and moving it over there so you know that will help and and nationwide they are also putting new stuff in but the bad part is is uh picture your father is your father computer literate okay he is he is at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go everybody is going to put all their work on computer well 

Recording: (1620/ 9621) 
um no actually now i live in hillside

for alcohol like on your breath at all 

Recording: (1622/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1623/ 9621) 
because the problem with guns in my opinion is you do not have to think to use it it takes you know you do not have to sit there and load it and and a split second i think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason you know just stupidity or whatnot just in a split second you know we we might have that once in life but we can kill somebody that quickly and you can not go out you know 

Recording: (1624/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1625/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1626/ 9621) 
relations but they are normal people outside of their homosexuality i mean it is nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (1627/ 9621) 
because they got beaches and and yeah yeah maybe it is like i do not think lake yeah can compare i would hurt 

Recording: (1628/ 9621)

Recording: (1630/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1631/ 9621)

Recording: (1632/ 9621) 
okay it does not have like the equalizer thing 

Recording: (1633/ 9621)

Recording: (1635/ 9621) 
to the art and tech department 

Recording: (1636/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1637/ 9621) 
you know and when i came back here i had moved uh to kentucky i came back here uh i would say nineteen seventy three 

Recording: (1638/ 9621) 
well i think in general like let us say if you took a handful of executives from bordan or att or someplace like that you would probably find that in general they are very concerned 

Recording: (1639/ 9621) 
i did not not like boston i just do not um i think it is it is kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (1640/ 9621) 
yeah but uh just to see the church might be fun uh we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worsehip center building and because we were really too too big for the sanctuary that we had 

Recording: (1641/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1642/ 9621) 
well yeah me either 

Recording: (1643/ 9621) 
so that is a little it required i am thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it 

Recording: (1644/ 9621) 
enough to satisfy me so that was good 

Recording: (1645/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1646/ 9621) 
that would not bother me at all 

Recording: (1647/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1648/ 9621) 
so i spent about six months my life in the yard 

Recording: (1649/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah i you know like i said i do not know i i just i got to make some decisions here and i do not know i do not want to put too much pressure on it you know one when the elders told me hey you know cut yourself some slack and just relax for a while you know because i worked at a movie theater for a year and you know i got hassled and bought my hair you know uh told me the only thing keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of scissors 

Recording: (1650/ 9621) 
seeing all the nice things just uh everywhere i could not believe it but now it is it is easy to take it for granted again just oh i am back home 

Recording: (1651/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (1652/ 9621) 
oh you have so it is like i mean when after i heard that i said my that is not even worth going to be very good 

Recording: (1653/ 9621) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be able to find enough to know that this is going to be something she is going to have the rest of her life um i will tell you what with today is world and some of these fourteen year olds that look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and no they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is just for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age seventeen maybe you know i think they should have a parents consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it is going to be if she is going to be a young mother and then then she may be not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you know and there is so much of that for a while there that was going on and it is like you i can not believe these women are doing this you know they just snap 

Recording: (1654/ 9621) 
but i i had a no den before i had the heart attack i had already had two heart attacks i had a no den and i needed to be on the first shift or i would probably have another heart attack and they would not put me on first shift then i had another heart attack put me in the hospital then i had another heart attack when i was in the hospital and when i came out that is when i gave them another note state and i needed to really be on first shift 

Recording: (1655/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1656/ 9621) 
and we called it uh the trash them a hall because they would supposed bunch of live information into it or a bunch of money 

Recording: (1657/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1658/ 9621) 
oh yeah look at you man 

Recording: (1659/ 9621) 
well that is interesting thing i am not in geology right now i uh i am actually making more money right now in music than i am in geology but i am making most of my money in something that is uh relevant to most of my that has nothing to do with any of my studies um yes i i play um principal horn in the uh symphony orchestra and um last year i was in a professional singing group but i am also in a number of volunteer choirs um the choir at the first military and universal church and and um a small choir where i work which i got the opportunity to conduct today conductor was the conductor was um not at work so uh i i do a lot of music in my spare time mostly uh but uh unfortunately i did not get a job in geology and i i do not have a full full time job in music either and either one of those would be nice but i 

Recording: (1660/ 9621) 
no uh i remember uh you know we would like go to a pool hall or something you know a bar actually you know they would be uh but we would play pool you know they would not let us drink or not because we were under age but uh you know it is basically the guys you know and the girls would go over to somebody is house you know and then we would meet up later on you know and go out several ways or we would drive in back then you know we would get a a movie and so uh but as far as going to shop and that was not really something that was that big of a thing i was maybe a saturday thing with mom and dad you know because they had to money you know so 

Recording: (1661/ 9621) 
you know i have just wanted the kids i have um you know you know and and i guess it is you and i have always wondered you know i turned eighteen i thought well should not i feel like an adult now you know it is twenty one should not i start to feel like the three spots am twenty five should not i be an adult you know and i wonder at what point do you really feel like you are you are on that other side are you one of the grown up people instead of one of the little people i maybe maybe that is maybe that is one i mean 

Recording: (1662/ 9621) 
you know just experiencing someone for who they are and so she is 

Recording: (1663/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (1664/ 9621) 
yeah harvard uh 

Recording: (1665/ 9621) 
i picked um legal secretary also but i chose the law enforcement over that because i got a substance to that too 

Recording: (1666/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1667/ 9621) 
they are trying it just does not seem like they are thinking ahead 

Recording: (1668/ 9621) 
and as a result like they are kids my age and stuff like that that i talked to i mean they have no idea what is going on 

Recording: (1669/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1670/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1671/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (1672/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1673/ 9621) 
yeah they do not know about it but then you know they like you said they do not want to see it 

Recording: (1674/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (1675/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1676/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (1677/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1678/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1679/ 9621) 
where do you do the aerobics 

Recording: (1680/ 9621) 
you know so i think maybe not universal health care but for children i think it would be helpful 

Recording: (1681/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1682/ 9621) 
that is funny 

Recording: (1683/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i i think that the stories have not been i i i mean i am some of my favorite like lines from the simpsons are where they are highly critical i mean one of my favorites is uh when bart the one where bart things he loses his soul which in some ways is kind of pretty she um because i mean like lease it takes other positions like you know whether the sole is is real it does not matter da da da but i love one scene where they are cleaning out the uh what bartin house are being punished they are cleaning out the pipes of the organs and the the pipes of the organ and uh like parts like there is no such thing as a salt you know house like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and then they it it cuts to uhreverrever and love joy emptying the uh uh uh what are the the the tip jars the the donation thing into a little change counting machine like on mine i am like i do not hear cleaning what do they have to um 

Recording: (1684/ 9621) 
definitely and it really makes you aware of your mentality i mean things you see everyday i mean you never know i could happen to anybody anytime just like that accident yesterday with um right 

Recording: (1685/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1686/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1687/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (1688/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (1689/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1690/ 9621) 
they she wants to go to columbia state uh wants to get into one of their engineering tech programs uh um-hum and i i hope she does but she is had to be responsible for herself her whole life um 

Recording: (1691/ 9621) 
my family yeah see them face to face uh recognize them and they will recognize me but something that transends it because as i look to them unlike when they are on earth my goodness we are taught to learn the most negative thing about a person psychology says if you see a black sheet of paper you see a on the thing you do not see the other ninety nine percent of the paper you see that dot it is gonna be just the other i can not think of a negative thing about you and the reason why you can not think of a negative thing about them because you see christ appearance come through that 

Recording: (1692/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1693/ 9621) 
i i do not i do not 

Recording: (1694/ 9621) 
yeah well 

Recording: (1695/ 9621) 
oh not in the immediate family going back like you did there i know there there is a murder area in our family uh oh there have been horse thieves uh i am going on back now i am not thinking in terms of the current family but basically what i was told my wife go is current families somewhat current 

Recording: (1696/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1697/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1698/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (1699/ 9621) 
i guess almost that over there i wish they would celebrate every holiday so then they are exposed to all of it instead of none of it 

Recording: (1700/ 9621) 
i went to one day they made me lunch all the time for two weeks and they paid me ten dollars a day 

Recording: (1701/ 9621) 
less fortunate out there and that there is little things we can do 

Recording: (1702/ 9621) 
yeah and yeah so i 

Recording: (1703/ 9621) 
that are it is uh i mean i i do not have it like my sister she is cooking every day 

Recording: (1704/ 9621)

Recording: (1708/ 9621) 
um there were people i met through friends um actually been one of my friends parents parents had a friend that was gay um and just be over there whatever i mean i can not say any big difference between 

Recording: (1709/ 9621) 
they can not see nothing wrong with that 

Recording: (1710/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it was just like there is a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like like preppie kids or like heck you type of kids you know 

Recording: (1711/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (1712/ 9621)

Recording: (1713/ 9621) 
how many people want that 

Recording: (1714/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (1715/ 9621) 
um you have to take a foundation of courses 

Recording: (1716/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (1717/ 9621) 
exactly um i think that would deter people um you get one strike and you are like oh um maybe i better clean up my act here 

Recording: (1718/ 9621) 
and none of the animals they profile were pets i mean a thirty six foot long python what the hell is a person doing with that as a pet and they should not be allowed to and then people treated a buffalo like they could stand next to it and take a family picture 

Recording: (1719/ 9621) 
and you either accept it or you do not or you know 

Recording: (1720/ 9621)

Recording: (1726/ 9621) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (1727/ 9621) 
you know what kind of an answer is that even if your answer is i do not know why you can not do it it just makes me uncomfortable you know that is a lot more fair than because i am the boss of you or something like that and i think if you raise by our your kids and and just kind of thought about her as what um you know kind of try to be i do not know that is the way that is the way my family has always been and it all seems to work really well for us 

Recording: (1728/ 9621) 
what is good now uh well the way i began has changed that there is computers have made a big difference uh it is more exciting now for people who in that area uh who are interested in it is more emphasis on information than not books and things going to the library it is getting the 

Recording: (1729/ 9621)

Recording: (1746/ 9621) 
then then that was always her main focus 

Recording: (1747/ 9621) 
i was living with my mom in like half and half like between custody or whatever i was living with my mom and half half with my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him and then uh my mom ended up moving getting remarried and like my dad is remarried by that time too and um remarried and this and they lived moved out to sunbury and like this house on five acres or whatever and so then oh when i came back i just lived with her up there

Recording: (1749/ 9621) 
is that where you got married 

Recording: (1750/ 9621) 
uh it is a very spiritual experience yes it gets hot there how hot who knows but it is been such a strengthening spiritual strengthening thing it also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat um it gets all the crap out of you 

Recording: (1751/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1752/ 9621) 
and uh so he was in the hospital and japan for some time and then came home but uh never would never say a lot about it 

Recording: (1753/ 9621) 
boy like action oh bite the bad guys yeah and now it is uh you know like looking in sort of postulating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metam the for things in real life uh and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and upon our culture i think it is kind of interesting and now that it is coming back out uh you know look at things from a little different perspective but i mean yeah of the maybe i think i have done about ten twelve painting of which i am like considered to be done and and like 

Recording: (1754/ 9621) 
and i do not know if it is quite that bad but but it was certainly somethings that he is been doing that are not i do not proved up and i am not real up on that 

Recording: (1755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1756/ 9621) 
yeah like when i do the silk screening and this it is kind of random but just anything 

Recording: (1757/ 9621)

Recording: (1758/ 9621) 
um one of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it and they have bugged me about it forever to come and like oh i do not know about computers so they took me finally like december or something

Recording: (1762/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i tried and tried i just said see it i did not change it i and i you know you keep hoping and you you just keep hoping but it is all upon him and obviously he does not love me enough to really want to change and settle down he still wants to do those things he is doing and i just need to move on 

Recording: (1763/ 9621)

Recording: (1786/ 9621) 
but you can also you can also grow with respect you can work with the community and still gain a respect from community and you do not have a legend but you know nowadays we do not have any of the loyal at all it is out the window and and that is why i fear the most you are saying there are not yeah big deal you are going out there what you want well maybe somebody want little cars they want service okay boom disposable that is a problem we have in our society today because of one thing we are trying to communicate as you say through the internet and through businesses but we do not have compassion and we do not have commitment without those three you will never have success 

Recording: (1787/ 9621) 
i know i 

Recording: (1788/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (1789/ 9621) 
well i mean as i mean like i was saying i he is at the ages where he needs to you know start learning things and she just does not do that i and that is probably the way she raised her kids but no we have totally different opinions about everything 

Recording: (1790/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1791/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1792/ 9621) 
uh i was good in the interview i knew what i was doing i kind of wished i had not been as prepared but uh but it was a lot of the i moved into a management position i was in it was a natural move it was not even a pay raise or anything it was a natural move and the people that i was supervising some of them had been doing it for twenty years and they made it very clear to me that they knew the program and i did not 

Recording: (1793/ 9621)

Recording: (1794/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (1795/ 9621) 
neither one of us can remember it so i do not know 

Recording: (1796/ 9621) 
then would be with the black president and i think it would cause problems um i do not know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see definitely i would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (1797/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (1798/ 9621) 
well because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be first to know that there is a lot of favoriteism you know some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other

Recording: (1822/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (1823/ 9621) 
i am hoping that will be the same experience as it is in the high states 

Recording: (1824/ 9621) 
um which one are you talking 

Recording: (1825/ 9621) 
you know and i just thought i just do not i just do not like this is not because this is something that when i look long term is something that i want to do with for the rest of my life and i said no it just does not you know and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible with somebody before you know people get into situations and they marry people that you just you from the outside you can look and you can think hey you nuts you know that is never going to work you know so i think that you just can have to take into consideration you know are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to that is going to work and be positiveyeah i do not i do not i am not old enough to do anything 

Recording: (1826/ 9621) 
so it is probably was not unexpected we just were not prepared for it i do not think you could be prepared for it 

Recording: (1827/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1828/ 9621) 
nothing happens you know over here yeah

that is my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 

Recording: (1832/ 9621) 
oh yes i will go back to full time most definitely when he is in school um if i could find something part time that pays more that is what i am looking for to do 

Recording: (1833/ 9621) 
spend a lot of uh a lot of problems with him he is uh uh the the brilliant kid uh they told us in elementary school he had the highest i think he would ever had tested he is very creative uh very talented musically uh he was taking lessons from uh gene walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university and he said that he thought charley had to make him to be a profession to make a living career as a jazz size of phone is uh but there is also in the last four years or so a lot of uh metal health problems

Recording: (1845/ 9621) 
yeah i not some of them just look like you know cracker back box houses that you know they put up in a week or something it is amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there is fifty homes because there is a lot of growth in hill here in hill here it is that is starting to scare us actually a little bit because now they just built another whole high school so two whole high schools i think they were up to two or three thousand senior graduates last year 

Recording: (1846/ 9621) 
and that was strictly no no 

Recording: (1847/ 9621) 
it was more fun without being 

Recording: (1848/ 9621) 
um then when you start to talk about homosexuality it would be easier to uh it would be easier for the kids to to see that they are just people you know 

Recording: (1849/ 9621) 
i was 

Recording: (1850/ 9621)

Recording: (1853/ 9621) 
right like magazines 

Recording: (1854/ 9621) 
is that right and i understand you know seeing seeing the sights or seeing well maybe they are but it is like that as as a as a you know as a secondary you tend to 

Recording: (1855/ 9621) 
our our janitor is worthless um-hum basically um we were complaining about it like earlier during the year three complaints uh formal complaints been file against him and he still refuses to change the bleach water like more than once a week it is just really disgusting so we had these tents come in one day and he was we went in like in shock it was so clean 

Recording: (1856/ 9621) 
i got a friend of mine that graduated from uh purdue university of indiana or something like that i think that is where it was i said bu bu university 

Recording: (1857/ 9621) 
but since all the moms have gone to work and let the tv become the electronic babysitter and the other thing that is happening is kids do not know things now that you would expect them to know like because their moms are not reading to them like they do not know who any of the who is 

Recording: (1858/ 9621) 
and i was glad i really uh nobody would ever mess with my children not even their father my husband or whatever 

Recording: (1859/ 9621) 
everybody gets something 

Recording: (1860/ 9621) 
i do not know 

Recording: (1861/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and they are also talking about because uh uh the actors the the reason they are ending it is because the actors do not want to do it there was talk i do not know if they are still pursuing this that they would have new characters take over the role and i mean the character development is the most important part i think um so i think that will be a failure but that also sort of tells me that there will get least things kind of open 

Recording: (1862/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (1863/ 9621) 
oh okay okay uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh does charity work

Recording: (1943/ 9621) 
she is she is adorable how old is she in this picture 

Recording: (1944/ 9621) 
see people now all of a sudden there is a rash of fires you read that in the news and people keep doing it i think society as a whole has gotten a lot more violent which made the kids more violent 

Recording: (1945/ 9621) 
well yeah 

Recording: (1946/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (1947/ 9621)

i have to get a job and support myself so 

Recording: (1955/ 9621) 
five years 

Recording: (1956/ 9621) 
so it brings that and it is like you know they are they are not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools i will bet you they are all about the same 

Recording: (1957/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (1958/ 9621) 
yeah we did we had uh um it called land parties there parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook them up to into a network and then you play games 

Recording: (1959/ 9621) 
pretty much i like i like playing um i like puzzles i like challenges i do not like trick set puzzles um i like anything that involves fixing it i do not mind breaking things either because then you have something effect afterwards i mean you have a very bad logic child 

Recording: (1960/ 9621) 
well he was not really diagnosed and until just the last couple of years and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed at the age d and it was not really there were not really good screening instruments for now there are now uh and we have often felt that he needed to have gifted emphasis for gifted children because uh and the uh schools would not do that for him because his grades were not good enough because he did not do the work 

Recording: (1961/ 9621) 
um he is a business man 

Recording: (1962/ 9621) 
on tennessee they are even friendly on some places 

Recording: (1963/ 9621) 
we want to clean or anything they would probably say you know they might think it was kind of weird but they would let you you know but they would be like you want to do this and we do not have any money to pay you oh but we do not you know we do not want money that is the whole point we are 

Recording: (1964/ 9621) 
okay dripping yeah 

Recording: (1965/ 9621) 
that is they are doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easier 

Recording: (1966/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (1967/ 9621) 
she thinks well you know that kind of makes up for me not working 

Recording: (1968/ 9621) 
okay and all these uh made choices for himself but as far as motivated uh for school now he is always motivated toward a career yeah he grew up here um-hum 

Recording: (1969/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (1970/ 9621) 
that is good 

Recording: (1971/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (1972/ 9621) 
um the mall i do not even like north and mall i wish would stay because i mean it is close to where i live um i have been going there all my since i was born probably um so 

Recording: (1973/ 9621)

Recording: (1979/ 9621) 
and the two daughters 

Recording: (1980/ 9621) 
and they were in italy and europe and uh there was not the definite enemy in vietnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of most of the guys that went to vietnam was a little bit different from right probably as a consequence of or understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1981/ 9621) 
well maybe it is crime is going down in the sense that it is applying you know it is criminals are not as active but there is more and more of these acts of violence it may be because they are so dramatic that you notice it 

Recording: (1982/ 9621) 
not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so inclined to like push their athletes to cut weight 

Recording: (1983/ 9621) 
yeah you got to remember it was all swamps back when i was a kid uh like i said i grew up down here it was mostly farmland when i grew up around here 

Recording: (1984/ 9621) 
it started on my neck and went down but it was automatic and i mean they had to take me the emergency room i did not know what it was until

Recording: (1990/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (1991/ 9621) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and within your community you know the parents for each individual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be all parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even know where they are you know it is the kids responsibility to get and go to school you know maybe the mom and dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being um shown and and have access to 

Recording: (1992/ 9621) 
oh yes 

Recording: (1993/ 9621) 
that is just it is ridiculous

Recording: (2001/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2002/ 9621) 
i would say of uh i think the the the v v a and generally sees on the average five to seven ten something like that a day and not all of them almost 

Recording: (2003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2004/ 9621) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory uh sexual harassment tapes and and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel as as instituted as your uh uh harassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crashes on you know you can not fault the girls for having crashes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (2005/ 9621) 
almost the minority it was a pretty even it is a very it is a low income neighborhood and when i was in seventh grade i remember going home and saying with everybody the same and being told well of course they are so i went to school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black and i got called into the office and they called me a social worker and they my was punished i was not allowed to uh i was grounded for the year and they never called this kid and i i then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up you know what what is wrong with these people they kept saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because i had so much potential and uh they were not going to let me throw my life away like this well it was you know it was bizarre and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy i am never going to i am never going to be like that and so i have a whole lot of different values for my family and it is real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (2006/ 9621) 
uh that is nice 

Recording: (2007/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (2008/ 9621) 
yes it is definitely have an effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i do not know but uh i am glad my children went to school when they did and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (2009/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2010/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah i you know if it is nice day on the weekends i 

Recording: (2011/ 9621) 
check this out and then he will let go and fall on his butt it is kind of funny 

Recording: (2012/ 9621) 
yeah there is like people calling and talk about other like they saw it and this other our mail order catalog that i have never heard of either it is i do not know how really they do it like it is just like they get people is names and stuff from credit card companies and then mail them out things and if people go back or whatever 

Recording: (2013/ 9621) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2014/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (2015/ 9621) 
it is it is gone right and 

Recording: (2016/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2017/ 9621) 
what his background really was 

Recording: (2018/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah i graduated from math and high school uh and rolled in the ou for uh the winter quarter and pursued a part of that out and at the time 

Recording: (2019/ 9621) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could have easily quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a clark public school and it they did not care i mean i i went through elementary and middle school with your aids and got there and i was on seats to these you know and it just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learn do you learn if you do not you do not if you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i am there i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (2020/ 9621) 
they are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (2021/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2022/ 9621) 
and she is taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctors uh orders and she is very careful what she eats and 

Recording: (2023/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (2024/ 9621) 
uh i live up north uh around carl and uh more so 

Recording: (2025/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2026/ 9621) 
but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one they are around their parents and their siblings and that is socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peers opinions because i i for one example the pockety mon craze my son did not know what pokey money was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh it is cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean you know what i mean because it is like they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about oh he must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was not cool so that was my influence our influence on him rather than the peers influence on him 

Recording: (2027/ 9621) 
it is grace brother and christian middle school it is part of worthyton school it is because they an xt it is 

Recording: (2028/ 9621) 
um i get a bs which they mail to me after first year of medical school like they figure that uh gross and that i mean all that is enough 

Recording: (2029/ 9621) 
yeah that seems good 

Recording: (2030/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2031/ 9621) 
um i do not know you know 

Recording: (2032/ 9621) 
he seemed to confused parenting with controlling 

Recording: (2033/ 9621) 
so i am not going to get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (2034/ 9621) 
i think it is important to know what the person is values and customers are and to support whatever it is and if i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed to face the north star or they needed to have this thing above the bat or under the bat and i mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (2035/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2036/ 9621) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like what do they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up in i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give an example i did not grew up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears bar caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures are different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or do you know what they mean that that is something different um except the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (2037/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2038/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2039/ 9621) 
do you see i do not care at all about i do not even drive 

Recording: (2040/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2041/ 9621) 
and i would just hear things 

Recording: (2042/ 9621) 
well i do not i do not think it is really alternative 

Recording: (2043/ 9621) 
she was alleging that students were writing a racial slurs on their desks and stuff but i had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any 

Recording: (2044/ 9621) 
i figure that will be plenty of fun if you had to one of them i just want green jello he did not make me snack so 

Recording: (2045/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2046/ 9621) 
and you you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now poor climbers you could not do that they went you could over there because you can walk around on the ramp over there and that always you 

Recording: (2047/ 9621) 
yeah see 

Recording: (2048/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2049/ 9621) 
yeah i have i i think because my dad was 

Recording: (2050/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (2051/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2052/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2053/ 9621) 
yeah i know that would be neat i would love to do that 

Recording: (2054/ 9621) 
you know she does not have to be wearing that tight outfit i think that is for ratings i really do think it is for ratings um 

Recording: (2055/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2056/ 9621) 
where it is where it is not such it is not weird it is just a family 

Recording: (2057/ 9621) 
about 

Recording: (2058/ 9621) 
so i do not know whether he had a boat or anyway there was a boat of value to him and and uh he would ride across the island 

Recording: (2059/ 9621) 
i that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not work that in ways that other people do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real a lot more temperamental we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things are not um even temperate or not things you would use to describe mean not but but not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have gotten over to i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important anymore 

Recording: (2060/ 9621) 
sixteen years old uh 

Recording: (2061/ 9621) 
and i realized that so it was like okay i am not going to do it for me but i am going to do it for the future and and that helped 

Recording: (2062/ 9621) 
uh you are little clicks clicks it is like being back in high school 

Recording: (2063/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2064/ 9621)

Recording: (2066/ 9621) 
readers digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level they now write it on the sixth grade level newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level for the general public it is just either we are getting more and more elderly kids that are not learned to read or um kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that well i read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set from the time they are born until they are five when they come to kindergarten they do not want to participate they want to sit back and be entertained and they are expecting you to do all this stuff and they are just gonna watch 

Recording: (2067/ 9621) 
just over summer and i used the apath and then i drove my dad down on far enough 

Recording: (2068/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (2071/ 9621) 
okay that is good 

Recording: (2072/ 9621) 
bro it off because i did not think that was fair um i think anymore though with uh women are more powerful and i think they they are finally making you know good money and used to be women needed men to take care of them and they were not as much in the work force you know i think things have changed really in the last ten years you know in the eighties still yes you know there was definitely a point in my life where it is like oh my ever going to meet anybody and all my friends honestly most of them were all married but um i enjoyed being single and i never really felt uh the urge just to get married to get married and i am i am glad of that 

Recording: (2073/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was ready oh yeah 

Recording: (2074/ 9621) 
the two parter uh last season where it was the advertised as fullhum and 

Recording: (2075/ 9621)

Recording: (2077/ 9621) 
uh-huh you have all these people and you got to keep their attention for like an hour or two 

Recording: (2078/ 9621) 
yeah it is true and i i i had johnson and i i you know that was of course i was i went to art school so johnson was just in case you had to look something up it was there um our lectures were all pretty pretty liberal so that you know that the art history we got was was different than what would be what would just be in jail so i never thought about that but um 

Recording: (2079/ 9621) 
we are not sure um we are looking to uh we right now we are looking to buy a house 

Recording: (2080/ 9621) 
yeah we are getting impatiens and we are getting um it is it is sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now they will be kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have but right now i think we are we are really not doing justice to the curriculum and i say to my friends i say teach these kids well because they are going to be running the country in our old age we will be sitting in a rock and chair and they will be running the country so you better teach them well when you look at it like that 

Recording: (2081/ 9621) 
you know so i do not know where to go to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that 

Recording: (2082/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (2083/ 9621) 
no we we have not uh you know there is always that fear uh but we have not 

Recording: (2084/ 9621) 
you did i 

Recording: (2085/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2086/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2087/ 9621) 
okay okay 

Recording: (2088/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (2089/ 9621) 
yeah right um first of all they are not really in love with you and secondly you are wrong so when i came here um i did not date 

Recording: (2090/ 9621) 
um oh 

Recording: (2091/ 9621) 
what i like best about it is when you are out in the middle of 

Recording: (2092/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2093/ 9621) 
it has this little bridge that goes up to the front door and a creek i mean it is cool 

Recording: (2094/ 9621) 
and some of the teachers actually had the right to search your bags and book bags i mean when it gets to that then yeah there is there is been teachers that actually pull students aside that they know they are trouble makers and say well you can not come down here you know and go to your locker at this time or whatever 

Recording: (2095/ 9621) 
uh six years ago 

Recording: (2096/ 9621) 
like politically as much uh well like um like i was in high school i was involved in like the democratic in the democratic campaign and just stuff like that just uh i would like to do something i am learning more about the environment because of this job but i would like to do something otherwise like uh a lot of like business leaders uh they are very they become very conservative when they get higher up because like the tax breaks they want to support things like that but i think there should be a good mix like uh there there could still be like a think tank of of executives that could be very liberal in their thinking and just you know for social for social not so much social change but you know not not um encouraging sweatshops within a corporation stuff stuff like that and i would like to get i do not know how i would get involved in something like that but i would like to it would be interesting 

Recording: (2097/ 9621) 
i do not 

Recording: (2098/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2099/ 9621) 
because you know you are trying to run and your dog is trying to great that dog and the dog is tripping you and your like i have actually been known to go am i have the only one following the rules around here because i am trying to run obviously it is hard for me to run so oh 

Recording: (2100/ 9621) 
oh yeah no no no no uh honestly no i am pretty shy for the most part so there is more types of women i can not say i really ever have a relation with or whatever it takes us hours to decide what we are going to do it i mean it just gets us nowhere i mean even some places simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we will spend a good half hour forty five minutes just driving around till we actually decide a place or someone says something or whatever so 

Recording: (2101/ 9621) 
yeah and it is a challenge living on one income that is why i have got a part time job now 

Recording: (2102/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2103/ 9621) 
we we do not necessarily overcome bad by bad we are still very much in that frame of cover efforts in this on this particular planet 

Recording: (2104/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2105/ 9621) 
yeah and that 

Recording: (2106/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2107/ 9621) 
yeah well actually i uh do silk screening for tshirts for my like for um like on the side for myself like to generate income and then also as of monday uh i am working at ohio it is an environmental group i will do be doing canvassing type stuff just basically going doortodoor satanis petition 

Recording: (2108/ 9621) 
true 

Recording: (2109/ 9621) 
there is no there is no there is no concept behind it yeah you are right you are right to some degree the uh area commissions are supposed to work on that and you know unify i i used to be on the university area commission and in the campus area and that is one of the things we work on although we some of the other commissions in columbus are almost strictly architect they only talk about the kinds of buildings that people can build and the university area commission we dealt with that we dealt with zoning whether something would be commercial or multifammy residence we dealt with parking a lot yeah yeah 

Recording: (2110/ 9621) 
i mean get the hell of it 

Recording: (2111/ 9621) 
it it was difficult uh i can not tell you how many times he had papers or projects to at school that we just have to sit there with him to keep him focused on doing it it one of the uh a diagnosis is probably eighty eight which he has trouble with working memory on how to get a project done and stuff like that uh we taught him how to do time lines and grant charts and things like that um but it was very difficult for him to be task oriented 

Recording: (2112/ 9621) 
it was fantastic 

Recording: (2113/ 9621) 
humum humum i must you know his dad was totally gone but he is been there ever since you know i was pregnant all through my pregnancy and he is been there for this whole two years i would not do that to him 

Recording: (2114/ 9621) 
you know and that was and that worked out well but i think too like with my school schedule you know if i am just in class maybe you know three four days a week and then the rest of the time in the evening jayson will be there so it is not like i am relying on her every single day all the time to do that and i really would not want to put my child in day care 

Recording: (2115/ 9621) 
and then they seem like random or just spontaneous and there is no way well nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except hide hide in your basement or something and that is what i work yeah 

Recording: (2116/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2117/ 9621) 
and obviously a lot more dangerous and i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to like a college or whatever 

Recording: (2118/ 9621) 
exactly it is sitting there you know germany state 

Recording: (2119/ 9621) 
well i work in the county department i am a county assistant 

Recording: (2120/ 9621) 
oh because some of the newer whoseets there is like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it is they are pop planes that are like five times as noisy 

Recording: (2121/ 9621) 
uh i do believe that in some cases uh the the parents or the uh responsible or they will should be uh found guilty of that 

Recording: (2122/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2123/ 9621) 
and and it keeps you this confidence because very few people know about this 

Recording: (2124/ 9621) 
whatever is going on i always have to have a backup plan though and then i know well if this happens this will work and if this does not happen this way then this is all we will do instead 

Recording: (2125/ 9621) 
in the in the us 

Recording: (2126/ 9621) 
i said well he did not it did not spell vegetables wrong but i doubt if your animal eats parts of buildings 

Recording: (2127/ 9621) 
i i you know i i just could not see doing that and it was i had enough to worry about and think about what i was trying to teach you class keep everything else straight and also mark down if people are participating uh that was tough i i ended up not doing it 

Recording: (2128/ 9621) 
oh i am kind of mad at my team at the moment 

Recording: (2129/ 9621) 
uh-huh well i i haveged eight friends and uh uh one of them worked at att and he retired and then uh and then the other one was on a disability and everything so uh that never even came up in that relationship nor did it come up in uh another couple of friends that i have had you know that they uh they more or less took care of each other you know so 

Recording: (2130/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2131/ 9621) 
and put in like the the street lights they have it eastern 

Recording: (2132/ 9621) 
at that point i get back to meet my year old 

Recording: (2133/ 9621) 
but um i was i i was interested in to seeing uh coleman be elected yes because uh she is a republican uh i used to work with 

Recording: (2134/ 9621) 
would make any difference or not 

Recording: (2135/ 9621) 
afternesse a number of years ago when we were traveling and everything else i uh we did absentee voting and i have just kept it up now one year i forgot to send it in throw it into the polls 

Recording: (2136/ 9621) 
yeah parents are very into this um my sister has no idea where she wants to go but uh they took me around all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted they are just saying go to us you 

Recording: (2137/ 9621) 
that was that was horrible 

Recording: (2138/ 9621) 
because it was also a nice like a hundred or such a pretty round number 

Recording: (2139/ 9621) 
okay my parents are still married i am from i lived there all my life i was born here in columbia so i really have not known anything else um have a dog named sammy i work in the dorms as a night assistant and i have a girlfriend right now 

Recording: (2140/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (2141/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah 

Recording: (2142/ 9621) 
yeah they are all really nice 

Recording: (2143/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2144/ 9621) 
uh you have got to have the leadership uh you have got to have the right people uh to have this school structured properly and to you know the people with the right credentials uh for the job you know and uh i am telling you some of these principals that uh that i have dealt with uh were highly overpaid as far as i was concerned for what they were doing um you know one one principal that from my daughter is high school he was out partying all the time they you know they he was he was right around in a corvette and uh he tried to take me out 

Recording: (2145/ 9621) 
great 

Recording: (2146/ 9621) 
cole like the black smith or whatever you know 

Recording: (2147/ 9621) 
oh i am a nice manager 

Recording: (2148/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2149/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2150/ 9621) 
the population is much different yes 

Recording: (2151/ 9621) 
and her husband works for a a uh testing company that does testing with it i do not know very much of that i probably should not even say but it is ultra with ultra something or other ultra sound equipment

thirty forty thousand it is international yeah 

Recording: (2155/ 9621) 
well i felt that uh you know palestin mall would be good for the city uh even though i want you know northland mall to stay there you know it would seem to be the big issue you know with northland mall 

Recording: (2156/ 9621) 
i think that basically that is it and the nut shows they have reached a point in their life where you know their their cow is as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or uh smoking you know whatever you know smoking uhprocrack or whatever and uh and then just living in the hell i mean 

Recording: (2157/ 9621) 
you are worrying 

Recording: (2158/ 9621) 
i think so i think so if you are willing you know anybody who is willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to you know you have to sell yourself there is you know you are not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered but um if you put out the effort i really do not i do not think there is that kind of that kind of discrimination anymore 

Recording: (2159/ 9621) 
well my husband is allergic when we first got together but i have to admit um it is it is they well he he goes he has other allergies um so he gets shots and things but you know they always say it is the pet dander

Recording: (2161/ 9621) 
we try and you know we try and and teach and expand people is knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ they do not have you know they do not have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something you know that somebody asks them something and they are like you know i do not know or they actually have an answer you know if if and if they do not know they will say i do not know but i can find out for you if you are willing to if you are willing to give me the time to go find out one of the hardest 

Recording: (2162/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2163/ 9621)

Recording: (2182/ 9621) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it it just there was nothing there there was no ability community there was a he needs some other piece of information at the same time there is no way i could tell it to him so yeah it is like no so i am yeah you do not know and there is nothing else to do about it and continue on merely and he i he said eventually he said it was sometime later when i actually found out what was going on i said i had some suspicions because you can draw a quick party count and figure out who is not there and if something bad has happened but um but he said but it was a while before i found out actually so so we could stop we could stop the store here we can go out because the store is just it is a fun story

Recording: (2262/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2263/ 9621) 
um i think they might have tried anyhow but obviously they would not have been as uh good at it or you know what i am trying to say would not have been as much destruction because obviously the bombs is something but to actually have that right there i mean have the access and whatnot i mean i guess the grandparents had the house locked and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew how to use them and that scares me 

Recording: (2264/ 9621)

Recording: (2281/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2282/ 9621) 
all the politicians or take the governor or take the president of the united states they can want something this way but then they have got the senate and all these other committees down below them that if they over rule him what good does he you know what can he do really so i mean no matter what he promises and you are voting him in there for what he is promising you but if he can not succeed getting these other guys to back him up there they went 

Recording: (2283/ 9621) 
period and it is that is a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way uh and people are suspicious of government asking questions 

Recording: (2284/ 9621) 
i do not know i i would not personally like think that the parents should be held responsible i mean they do have you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware and and especially because i mean i believe that those at least one of the two had been in counseling and had that you know was doing aggressive management or something like that um you know you would think that if they were going through something like that you would just sort of you know maybe keep a closer eye on what they were doing so i think you know to that degree you know the parents should have um you know were sort of responsible and also with like their kids disposition i mean you know would you not know to some difference or something like that was going to happen i mean depending on uh you know how well they hit it or whatever but um i think at that point though you are you are so influenced by your peers 

Recording: (2285/ 9621) 
so i became a business major 

Recording: (2286/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2287/ 9621) 
casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice uh you know gaining power because of it and then ultimately seeing the the foley of the ways and dying in the classic um tragic hero sort of way um and so i am looking forward to how they build up to that point um a lot of people in high school they what the hell are you talking about though but uh um yeah i am looking forward to seeing how things come about 

Recording: (2288/ 9621) 
most how 

Recording: (2289/ 9621) 
uh it is i mean it is a lot better than it was even a year ago 

Recording: (2290/ 9621)

Recording: (2291/ 9621) 
to preach and they were always in places like washington state and louisiana and tennessee and idaho and oregon just everywhere but it made it interesting to visit them 

Recording: (2292/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2293/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2294/ 9621) 
as a teacher how would you and how could you cut down a student and say no that is not the way it was and it is this you are looking for the teacher is guide no but how do you know about asking the person but it is a matter of tradition and having it down to the tradition itself it is a matter of having in your family what did your parents think of this way and that way and it is it is not let us say written down but it is passed on those days probably written down or not written down by a verbal and extended it and so it is that handmed down from generation 

Recording: (2295/ 9621) 
um living here all my life i do not like it you know i like the old cowboys i mean they can call it what they want to it was easy to get around you never had any traffic you do not sit on the freeway like you do now it is like you do not want to go out at four oclock or you know you just do not want to get involved in it so i do not know it grows as good but i guess i am not into it as much as i a lot of other people it is good for the economy but it is just amazing all the every time you turn around they are plopping two four hundred home unit you know developments up there and then i am just thinking where are these people all coming from you know you just can not imagine where these people all move from you know this is getting scary yeah what is the big draw you know and you know you still see you know when they opened up a loan and steak near our house they could not even do lunch because they did not have the people i think so you know that it is people are just dying for people to work out there 

Recording: (2296/ 9621)

yeah can not really take her with you yeah you can not get her in you can not get her in it will be eighteen to get into dance clubs now but um that is uh those are the two really really tough ones that a lot of people will will will throw at you when you are when you are trying to share things with them but there is i mean there is a whole there is a whole list of them and uh it is just a matter of i mean i i do not i am getting myself to a point where i can go out and share my favorite of their people i do not think i am ready to um because one of the biggest problems is like i mentioned with with the brother jet thing is undoing the damage other people have done and i do not have enough knowledge up here to really go out and and you know to go out and be like a campus preacher i mean i will tell i will share my faith with people that are really close to that like you know colees and other and other thing and other people that are like if somebody if somebody gets real close to me in a class you know eventually i will share and eventually i will share with them but like if i am in a lecture hall i am not going to jump up and start hollering about my face um and and i will not i will not walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people i do not feel i am ready to do that yet i think there are a i think there is a place in the time for doing certain things like um and this is this is one of the biggest um things that people use as as a reason for faith faith is something that people do not understand i do not even understand it i use it as i use it as an answer for a lot of questions that i do not have answers for his faith and that is what religion is religion is faith every religion has has to have faith you have to believe that what you are doing and what you are believing in is right you know whether everyone else in the world thinks it is or not you have to believe it is or you are being or you being part of that religion has absolutely no meaning and that is an answer that a lot of people do not like to hear and you know like um i have walked down like high street before and gotten this urge this feeling to just share my faith with certain people on the on the sidewalks like i share i shared my faith uh a little while ago with some street bombs and they were real receptive you know i do not know if they were drunk but they were real receptive i mean i i do not know if they really understood what i was saying but i felt led to talk to them and that is what i believe my faith is my faith is is faith it is believing that things happen that you can not explain there is it is believing that uh you are doing what you are doing is right so religion is a real big part of my life 

Recording: (2389/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (2390/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2391/ 9621) 
it is made a little inconvenient when he lived in the uh the twin tower in the dorm because if i needed them to come home or something you know well i do not know if i got to get it get to my car some kind of way you know

Recording: (2393/ 9621) 
people want a number they do not want to know the methodology that goes into it or the the disclaimers of footnotes they do not want to read the footnotes they want a number uh when i worked for the state one program i worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas of ohio um which actually used to originally started here at the university of ohio as a federal program department labor it was district state level and uh it did not did not turn out very well so they switched it over to me uh for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university is fault um they had to rely on confidential information which we could not give because it was confidential uh by federal law it was confidential we could not give it to them but they needed it so it it was just not a good good way to do business uh we would present information we there uh for instance there is just this number of people in an occupation but there was also a range of error on there where people would not notice that and they would take that number as gospel and you just could not convince them that well it really means more than that uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we did not really at that time collect wage data so we were kind of a condo it for several different departments in the the state in the federal government to collect occupational data we were kind of a condue it for the state for that um people they wanted an hourly rate they did not want arranged they did not want they they wanted a number and that is what that was gospel but it is based on survey data so and you know there is always statistical error in there and stuff and try to explain that we spent more time when people have called and given information explaining this is what this really means then they are just giving them the number that we spent more time doing that uh 

Recording: (2394/ 9621) 
can be nice 

Recording: (2395/ 9621) 
right you got to pick your battles right

Recording: (2400/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (2401/ 9621) 
i can not really see a problem with it um but like i said i mean if he is going around like picking fights and things like that then i mean i can not say i would support anyone like that 

Recording: (2402/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (2403/ 9621) 
yeah why not take advantage of this yeah why not take advantage of that so 

Recording: (2404/ 9621) 
yeah and i had sold with the well i made it i knew that what had to happen on the outside which is really only some uh minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the front yard and then we have there is a guy who works for me who is um i just do not know how he can how he makes a living because he is very very reasonable he is also very loyal to me he is done stuff for me for years and uh and he is not that old he is probably twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow pat went in we added a bathroom there was a bedroom we added a half bath off the kitchen and we put in the uh changed the back door and put in the deck and he did those kinds of things and you know and then we were ready to go and i said i was gonna sell it myself and everybody thought i was crazy and i had an open house and i sold it that day i had thirty i had like thirty some people and i got my offer that afternoon i got what i wanted well i did not get it immediately i the realtor told me i should ask a hundred and thirty four and i asked a hundred and forty six instead because i really felt i i knew that this was a nice house and i knew i had beautiful hardwood floors building bookcases and i just knew that i i could have seen me wanting that house and do you know what i mean it is like that i would done a do thing and so somebody came through and they uh with a realtor and they made me this offer that was real low it was like a hundred and thirty eight and the the a realtor i i am thinking about because it was funny he delivered the offer to my home and i was gracious and i thanks and i got inside and i opened up and i thought and they were really on the porch and said wait a minute this is never going to work 

Recording: (2405/ 9621) 
yeah but they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduced deductions it went down too yeah yeah and then again you say well you know like uh maybe some affluent uh person would donate in his publicize

Recording: (2407/ 9621) 
everybody is living longer everybody is uh there is more medical things where people get uh can be healed from things that they could not be healed from uh so everybody today is living uh basically is today as her future were back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean i would not really think about today i mean i think about tomorrow 

Recording: (2408/ 9621) 
that is kind of tough going 

Recording: (2409/ 9621) 
yeah it is a competitive type analysis 

Recording: (2410/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2411/ 9621) 
i i did not see that part i missed that beginning and all i seen was the the chart and i was like whoa you know that that is one reason why i would hesitate to put my kind of clothes public just like um the day care 

Recording: (2412/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2413/ 9621) 
yeah i mean you do not want to see the chain gangs with the people with them i mean let us that is not right either um but yeah i am not for the weight rooms because like they said they come out and then they are stronger and they can do more damage yeah and you are like great we pay for that okay so uh i i think just to keep them busy you know even if they educate them i have heard of people you know the education um uh strong i do not think it really hurt anybody um uh uh i would say incorporated that with some education um of some you know i mean i do not want to go out in sun and work for five hours or whatnot plus they are doing something and returned for free housing do you know what i mean it is kind of a given take there 

Recording: (2414/ 9621) 
but i think it should be an option you know i am really you know for women is rights and everything because i was single for so long and i just feel if a man could have a child it would be different but since women are the only ones that can then it is ultimate ultimately should be our choice i really do and i think you know we should have every option available especially when you are young no girls should have to go through you know pregnancy and everything even if it is a mistake or whatever i just you know it it ruins our lives when they do not have the option 

Recording: (2415/ 9621) 
yeah i will explain that to them 

Recording: (2416/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2417/ 9621)

think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (2452/ 9621) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is really easy life 

Recording: (2453/ 9621) 
yeah uh four or five years that is not that bad uh how old oh that is very young yeah you do not want another one you have you have at least you know diapers out of the way before you go to the next one that is

i think the point is there on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself racist at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things like you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (2455/ 9621) 
you know that is one of the things that i really you know when i read the paper i think wow what can you do it has to start there first you know and i think if uh and i and this might be because i am a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to think you know like the government and that kind of thing those kind of uh funds that are available for different organizations and they are all geared toward things that essentially help them as a whole or help um well yeah but i mean not so much that um it is always been the women is responsibility to be responsible for the kids or to care about their well being and the a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing men are more let us go get it and you know we need more money and you know they are 

Recording: (2456/ 9621) 
uh-huh

i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together the only thing that is going to happen is it is going to trickle down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy then one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like it is your you know because it is my fault because it is happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not that is a totally different perspective just to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (2466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2467/ 9621) 
like well she was studying or something i think we played at home or since and she got she got so mad it was so worth it 

Recording: (2468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2469/ 9621) 
it it might uh it might um i was going to say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i have seen in recent years utilizing college age students has been clinton is campaign both times uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase um his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign and and i believe that was ninety two did a really super job of organizing college students because that is when you are at your most um well when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that you know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and as an under current it was not over in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is a very device issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divides them you know the the finitively almost like in vietnam almost like that word divided people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting rovers is weight and not and then protecting choice you know i um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and uh that if you want to protect that right you have got to vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way both in ninety two and again in for your ninety six uh and i think that is going to happen again because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um i i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidate a or candidate b because they will protect abortion rights that is going to divide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2470/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2471/ 9621) 
oh they just 

Recording: (2472/ 9621) 
i am not real big on the denomination because i think that i think that sort of goes against what the original intent of of christian entity was i i mean it was designed to be a unifying religion and the denomination are are just are are just yeah i do not i do not like them 

Recording: (2473/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2474/ 9621) 
yeah right i taught um well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i have been in 

Recording: (2475/ 9621) 
i would say probably the black man 

Recording: (2476/ 9621) 
it is like where i work at the only way i can get a raise is by being uh like the kids used to say a tackle tail squeal or whatever you want to call 

Recording: (2477/ 9621) 
going at my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs and so i was always interested in the food industry but more so with planning of the parties and deciding you know what the clients needs are and uh i really like working in that aspect with you know nice shops and really creative food and um and it is nice because every basically every job is usually different um i am doing a function tonight for three hundred people for the higher republican party and you know there is just needs for each thing that i do which makes it interesting 

Recording: (2478/ 9621) 
if you have to come back to this weather i would uh i is it really 

Recording: (2479/ 9621) 
but uh 

Recording: (2480/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2481/ 9621) 
yeah we have run an on line system where people use and connect to our system and build a data bases or or access to data bases um it is state the uh everything oh issue has in their library collection is in our system their records came from us uh yeah well they yeah and we do that for uh tens of thousands of laboris yeah 

Recording: (2482/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2483/ 9621) 
kind of yeah um actually with this case i do know what happened to the father i can not even move into colorado um 

Recording: (2484/ 9621) 
uh being here at the university 

Recording: (2485/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2486/ 9621) 
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else i really do not understand that some people do it 

Recording: (2487/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2488/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2489/ 9621) 
but you do not really have to work because are there apparently 

Recording: (2490/ 9621) 
i think it better grades last nine weeks did not i well it is not amazing you were taking your bills in some connection here so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let us just go through some of the things that give you trouble and we will write them down and say oh well last night we did that without any problem at all this night we except you have not been able to focus on that maybe that is a death help you some maybe you just you know not giving it credit 

Recording: (2491/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah she went to school here till uh ninety one actually uh so she was let us see about the fourth grade fifth grade something like that 

Recording: (2492/ 9621) 
to say you know what i am thinking of somebody shoot those people but i 

Recording: (2493/ 9621) 
as far as what he did i i am sure he probably did go to meetings but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i know i am i am sure he was not 

Recording: (2494/ 9621) 
and um i think they have a lot to do you know the parks and things like that so um i will just hold it off but i like it because it has art and culture and um it does not feel like a big city 

Recording: (2495/ 9621) 
most of them are still suddenly just sitting there following my directions but they are getting better 

Recording: (2496/ 9621) 
i think you do that here 

Recording: (2497/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2498/ 9621) 
really you know i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out they would vote for none of the above and then we could have some more candidates 

Recording: (2499/ 9621) 
yeah i know it is good one of us yeah 

Recording: (2500/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (2501/ 9621) 
that was grade school 

Recording: (2502/ 9621) 
i mean some really 

Recording: (2503/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2504/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2505/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2506/ 9621) 
obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is i have been around for a long time 

Recording: (2507/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2508/ 9621) 
yeah well what what my opinion on our whole penal system is just you know well it goes along we are kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now we are definitely neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they need to obviously they someplace some point they have uh learned to incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh they need to have psychological helpyou know 

Recording: (2509/ 9621) 
but it did not bother me uh religion is basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties uh i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or something like that but uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspoken than some muslims and uh islam and uh jews and jews and everything so and then there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you you got to meet yourself you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know if you believe in religion you are here temporarily for an attorney turner later on you know 

Recording: (2510/ 9621) 
it was been real helpful you know with uh uh being that support you know my parents are very supportive but you know it was just sickening they i when i sat down there and they just you know the bidding started at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars and my attorney looked at them and said are you looking nuts i said this guy had his head split open and it was your negligence so you know we will we will take that as an assault 

Recording: (2511/ 9621) 
to come in and they came with our neighbors like years ago you knew everybody in in town well the town i grew up in was some station and i do not know if you are that old ten when you town or not but it is not a very big town and everybody knew everybody 

Recording: (2512/ 9621) 
i wish i knew the answer uh but but reality you know uh i just feel sorry for the the people that not only feel that they have to do that but and also for the people that are involved in it and the other this victims and everything and their parents and everything the only one i really had uh i was really upset with uh with the conally by and deal and that was because uh the one kid was making bonds and stuff like that and the base that and the parents knew nothing about or or they did they did not even think anything about and i do not think that behavior is uh appropriate for a sixteen seventeen year old kid 

Recording: (2513/ 9621) 
um because he he likes the what through this hitting spell where he likes to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yell but it is hard not to yell i try to talk to him 

Recording: (2514/ 9621) 
oh yeah we are members of there 

Recording: (2515/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2516/ 9621) 
uh and he had been through a counseling experience before and it it he just played along with it then to get way out of it i think but 

Recording: (2517/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (2518/ 9621) 
nothing serious now 

Recording: (2519/ 9621) 
so i mean basically the entire winter i would either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight and i have i was really starting to feel it physically 

Recording: (2520/ 9621) 
okay so our back gun is still there but ultimately as we get traffic uh measurements we will be able to down size the number of pipes we have so streamlining our network 

Recording: (2521/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2522/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2523/ 9621) 
whatever you want sure 

Recording: (2524/ 9621) 
i am sure uh 

Recording: (2525/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2526/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2527/ 9621) 
and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when i was about i think six years old i think and then they moved up uh to clintonville about when i was about eight and now my dad lives up in clintonville too so 

Recording: (2528/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2529/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2530/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2531/ 9621) 
i that is another thing that that we are i am in all this with my parents or that they do not understand the fact that why would i go to college i pay for it myself i worked my way through school i was so proud of the fact that i was like only a quarter late of my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it as i went and and i did not have any loans i was when i was done it was paid for and so um of course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making you know fifty cents an hour at the beverly across the street on the avenue so uh uh but but anyhow you know they could never understand you know he did not he never got a job with it you know why would you go to school and waste all that money i even spent this money i ever spent 

Recording: (2532/ 9621) 
you know they are just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something a little more nationwide but they really just want to start off at something easy and um they only take national merit scholarships in there 

Recording: (2533/ 9621) 
turn the turn the music up and it is already blasted you know 

Recording: (2534/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2535/ 9621) 
and they fought a lot there was a lot of violence and then i loved walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i i swear i have not seen a walt disney movie that does not have violence in it 

Recording: (2536/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2537/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (2538/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2539/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2540/ 9621) 
it is got to be easier than this you know 

Recording: (2541/ 9621) 
in the world 

Recording: (2542/ 9621) 
yeah exactly exactly 

Recording: (2543/ 9621) 
yeah and just a couple of things i remember when i first started going to the military and church up here on uh well when i was in sunday school we we drove there from reynoldsburg by going up i think reynoldsburg new all the way road up to uh more road and then over on more is road to high street so it was it was on the back roads you know and that was before the mid sixties when the freeway was built i seventy was built through town and a lot of a lot of times you do not realize what kind of havoc that creates when a freeway is built through the middle of a town because you have to take out a lot of houses to do that and you you can sort of realize it if you ever go around the area and go to one of the little side streets that dead ends because the freeways there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been twenty or thirty houses that they had to take out here 

Recording: (2544/ 9621) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you are i mean kids like that i could see if they are in a poor harloom or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood and a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children their son was doing 

Recording: (2545/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (2546/ 9621) 
so it is not uh there was a man named sun bear who was uh recruiting women you know and telling them they had to sweat make it 

Recording: (2547/ 9621) 
i mean i could practically graduate already i have all the credits but then you have those required classes that you have to take 

Recording: (2548/ 9621) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (2549/ 9621) 
you know my older sister is different case she is a little better but it it is you know as long as you have a good parent it you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father she she did very well 

Recording: (2550/ 9621) 
with medicare type of 

Recording: (2551/ 9621) 
oh wow how would you hook up with that or is this you just happened 

Recording: (2552/ 9621) 
yes private homes and um actually where i work there is not a facility 

Recording: (2553/ 9621) 
go out 

Recording: (2554/ 9621) 
that is the only way that i can get a raise over there where i work at 

Recording: (2555/ 9621) 
he was living with this one family for a while um and they were noticed and taking him to notice camps and stuff like this uh uh when you think they would they never had any contact with us they just let him move in can you imagine letting your fourteen year old friend just move in and not find out why or anything 

Recording: (2556/ 9621) 
i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran 

Recording: (2557/ 9621) 
her house in india is like this mansion in the house servants there i mean it is really impressive just the house is just worth more so you can not get as much house here but yeah everybody is doing well 

Recording: (2558/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (2559/ 9621) 
we come to as many games as we can um uh we both golf and um we like hiking swimming um every year we used to go on a trip this year we went to new mexico we were thinking about moving out there 

Recording: (2560/ 9621) 
we do we develop a lot of software and projects and our consulting side 

Recording: (2561/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2562/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2563/ 9621) 
and you are totally not doing it so i am trying to stick to that sorry um 

Recording: (2564/ 9621) 
yeah and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the wall is very true you know i can see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings you know the uhthat i can not explain and i still can not explain it i just know what i see and then i go and try and tell all the psychologists or psychiatrist for they want to put me on some kind of antilus and indianic medication and i say well this man you know i am not loose enough 

Recording: (2565/ 9621) 
that is i can not it was not it is not in a movie well there we go 

Recording: (2566/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (2567/ 9621) 
by the eighth grade they are sixth and seventh graders pretty much know everything and you are the stupid one but by the time they get to eighth grade they are going well you are the best teacher i can not believe i would send that to you 

Recording: (2568/ 9621) 
well i think uh in my opinion i think mainly the uh is the absence of uh basically parenting you know uh my mom was there uh she was a housewife you know and uh so she was she went to work after i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother and all my brothers and sisters are graduated you know so 

Recording: (2569/ 9621) 
she went to high school she just barely works at all apparently 

Recording: (2570/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2571/ 9621) 
no i really just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (2572/ 9621) 
you know you have to be a good example i mean if you if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right thing then think that is the best you can do for 

Recording: (2573/ 9621) 
so he gives them a drug called well buton which is a you know like an enid press that type thing that they said works for um eighty hd but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study 

Recording: (2574/ 9621) 
i am during different points of the day i dont know 

Recording: (2575/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2576/ 9621) 
but it made a lot of people more rare 

Recording: (2577/ 9621) 
well i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes uh you know a lot of the you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and uh you know maybe pull these kids uh into more of a group setting or something and give them more um you know counseling uh professional you know counseling because it is uh you know i i did not have good experiences with foster homes and and i know of a lot of kids you know that are saying that i think that the parents have too many rights you know in the courts and there is just a lot going on you know that uh it is not going to get better it is going to get worse you know with the way families are torn apart now and uh you know mothers have to work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that a you know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on uh that needs to be restructured so 

Recording: (2578/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2579/ 9621) 
i mean obviously if someone is like thirty and a gay i do not see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 

Recording: (2580/ 9621) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in uh twenty or twenty five years or something like that and he had killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a cop out if there ever was one just to give him a lethal injection and let him go he should have rotted in prison for no that is not a punishment he was off his rocker there is not anybody who murders who is not insane 

Recording: (2581/ 9621) 
and they had they you know they went through their own training and everything and we did not you know face with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one walking or march and summer but as far as pratt or nissan you were not allowed to 

Recording: (2582/ 9621) 
it is so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or just to come to all the things and ninety percent i do not know whether you can say what happens in washington have become you know there is is i do not i do not hear any of them raising hell about what really matters in this country 

Recording: (2583/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2584/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2585/ 9621) 
um i do not really know i would say i mean it is definitely what is nature and definitely something has to be done to them 

Recording: (2586/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2587/ 9621) 
you know and he it is it is hard to know what he is going through how much of it is uh normal teenage republican and how much of it is 

Recording: (2588/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2589/ 9621) 
well yeah when he was i do not remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been collic or whatever but he just cried and you know 

Recording: (2590/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (2591/ 9621) 
and because about the um um athletic director that was here at the time he quit because he did not want to fire them and they over ruled him 

Recording: (2592/ 9621) 
yeah so i get a lot of you know what from my sisters 

Recording: (2593/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2594/ 9621) 
yeah i was in the sales department through telephone marketing there was actual sales that i was doing i was there for fifteen years 

Recording: (2595/ 9621) 
it is like a double scene i think it is weird 

Recording: (2596/ 9621) 
and then remember back on it 

Recording: (2597/ 9621) 
i wear but uh it was real weird 

Recording: (2598/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2599/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2600/ 9621) 
well i i think that my opinion is that if you can go to school and you are not going you know at work and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know and a lot of kids that is all they really want to do nowadays is just cause aggravation up here 

Recording: (2601/ 9621) 
to the hub uh which of course limited down time but with um that we were not in a position to monitor traffic 

Recording: (2602/ 9621) 
oh long 

Recording: (2603/ 9621) 
and i think um of course we would all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think you class maybe and then and then there ought to be it it should be known that you can go to your counselor 

Recording: (2604/ 9621) 
and i said turn it go you know i tell people i even though it could be a clinic and everything and i got the homeless thing uh over there and i said you know this guy friend i know you know he is a vietnam but you guys need to get out to and help him you know i mean you are in more of a know i mean you are in more of a uh situation than i have to be able to go out and and and sit or but he wants to be taking like mary haven or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is take to her so she is up and goof back out 

Recording: (2605/ 9621) 
of the medical school class which is two hundred and twenty 

Recording: (2606/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2607/ 9621) 
no no deterrent all the all the kids went into that just so intensive and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean uh the visual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these mess and hoods and 

Recording: (2608/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2609/ 9621) 
kind you know we know but it is 

Recording: (2610/ 9621) 
that would be great i would do it definitely 

Recording: (2611/ 9621) 
if you got a car it is easy to get there yeah but if you if you are right up bus it sometimes uh takes a couple hours 

Recording: (2612/ 9621) 
in some ways i like it and some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is relatively safe place to live although that is coming from me i have been robbed at gun point or nice point about four times i think in columbus yeah maybe five um i drove a taxi cab for a couple of summers and i was robbed i think twice driving a cab and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around the mountain vernon area and uh they got very little money but i was not hurt 

Recording: (2613/ 9621) 
on tv and in the movies 

Recording: (2614/ 9621) 
i love columbus actually um when i left i was fed up with columbus and but like anything you know after being away for a while and not really you know being i mean i have friends there and everything but you know i miss my friends and i miss really sort of you know knowing everything in the city because london is never going gonna be like that for me you know and it is just a totally different experience and you know i did miss columbus and i am kind of glad to be back although now i miss london so 

Recording: (2615/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2617/ 9621) 
they tried sampling well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (2618/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2619/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2620/ 9621) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so is arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age and they sort of give a background on him and that is what everyone basis their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one side of the store i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on then they are telling you um so i really do not see a big problem with the way the america is going or whatever the youth um and like i say i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that or being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (2621/ 9621) 
yeah the we did not really get the the video tape they gave us was half commercials and then things like things they had to clean the um bill with i mean stuff like that but your you know as far as actual parenting things like there was really nothing 

Recording: (2622/ 9621) 
yeah he actually his his dad is mother babysits 

Recording: (2623/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2624/ 9621) 
but the professors seem more center centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you know you can not diminished all your bottom line for you know making your workers feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (2625/ 9621) 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um uh i think there is something else in the bible where you know she the lady gives gives only a small portion compared to a large portion but in relation to what her income was it meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need to promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialize we need to think more of that but i think really too late what would you be doing up here third world country and do you have choice 

Recording: (2626/ 9621) 
i said this will never work i am not interested to take it back and he said no no no just let us just work with it just work with us we will we will take care of it so i ended up down to him for a hundred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought i thought they are never going to get to where i have to be and we are not even going to play this game back and forth 

Recording: (2627/ 9621) 
i thought it was stupid 

Recording: (2628/ 9621) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um it is like i said by no means am i saying yeah go president clinton or anything like that but uh i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2629/ 9621) 
crime 

Recording: (2630/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2631/ 9621) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (2632/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2633/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals in the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there or whatever and the kids um they are basic where they learn things as their peers they do not get everything instilled at home uh that is pretty much what you know i seem to talk it to my husband and you know and there is so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (2634/ 9621) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they just probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still have not always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but where the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students um there there is a a whole world of difference between their attitudes and a lot of things and you know women is minority issues uh it just fell in hand to them and it does not you know it is not like it was for us which was a sea change for them it is normal and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote you know you would have to find aedy who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote 

Recording: (2635/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2636/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2637/ 9621)

Recording: (2638/ 9621) 
uh not as much as i used to be when i was younger used to be die hard but not anymore you know yeah yeah yeah by their standards but they still were six or six you know and they probably could have won maybe a couple more games but that is about it you know really 

Recording: (2639/ 9621) 
uh-huh it is it was cool yeah so i i like pretty much all kinds of music yeah i did sometimes to find the kind of music i really do not like that much and i like some country music my i guess my favorites are are classical and uh rock rock and roll especially i like some of the stuff that is coming out now i like oldies and the seventies and the sixties and uh i guess what is hard for me to listen to is i guess i do not know it used to be wmci where they part of the reason was i they just played the same song over and over again yeah 

Recording: (2640/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they do not have any of these like matinee specials where you can go with like a buck fifty huh 

Recording: (2641/ 9621)

to do that 

Recording: (2644/ 9621) 
whoops that 

Recording: (2645/ 9621) 
i should not be having to clean quite as much as i do now um i would say by ten they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themselves i know i did it ten and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house 

Recording: (2646/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2647/ 9621) 
and uh my oldest sister started to school out there 

Recording: (2648/ 9621)

Recording: (2653/ 9621) 
like i know like i was a four year remember student council and like did that did not went that route in high school and i know we always tried to involve other people but like they would look at us and be like that is so lame i would never do it 

Recording: (2654/ 9621)

i said man where are they pulled over like uh it must be something going on he was uh we ai not going to worry about it right now we get back up here three oclock in the afternoon and i look over and there is this big old white swirling cloud comes down it is about two miles west of us i am coming just out of out of my screws here i am just going 

Recording: (2656/ 9621) 
i was thinking of grandchildren 

Recording: (2657/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum right well and i am right now i am forty five years old so i have lived in or around columbus for most of forty four years including times when i was away at school 

Recording: (2658/ 9621) 
every time i found myself it was up it is a nice feature sorry i will stop go ahead does not matter when i clear my throat and you are listening to it and it is going to be annoying yeah my apologize is in advance 

Recording: (2659/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2660/ 9621) 
and that is the way i have put it it is kind of new agey and i do not like new agey stuff but you know it is uh the best example is a maz from the dark when you flip on a light the maz will go right to it a child like that a young man like that is very impressionable very young still and uh these bad spars will be flocked right to him 

Recording: (2661/ 9621) 
uh i have not read enough to know i i saw a a a preliminary saying that they were going to protest and uh but i do not i i am not informed enough to give an opinion on that 

Recording: (2662/ 9621) 
yeah okay see the way i look at heaven myself is that i have a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the past 

Recording: (2663/ 9621) 
you know how to modify like i give in services all the time at my school for the regular ed teachers and i show them they go well that is going to make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem instead of all forty of them going to make 

Recording: (2664/ 9621) 
i mean 

Recording: (2665/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2666/ 9621) 
do you know what i mean 

Recording: (2667/ 9621) 
yeah one of my uh friend is cousins went to that maternity um i do not remember what the cause was of his death um but i mean like i said i mean it definitely is a dangerous drug to be using and i mean not to say that they should legalize it or anything i mean obviously that is pretty extreme to do but like you said i mean it is something more where people should know the risks of it and know what goes into it i mean it is sort of like if you saw something laying on the street and you decide to eat it or whatever 

Recording: (2668/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2669/ 9621) 
well um my family is so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together now you know uh it back that you know my we uh you did not see her uh you did she is cute she is got a little hair cut and she is our like but um 

Recording: (2670/ 9621) 
no the worst thing to happen was that while it got stolen out of a locker 

Recording: (2671/ 9621) 
relax yeah 

Recording: (2672/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2673/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2674/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2675/ 9621) 
it really does not look like i mean 

Recording: (2676/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2677/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2678/ 9621) 
and it is like a car has a computer but it does not know if it is uh monday or two thousand and fifty it has no idea it it means nothing it is not date sensitive you know so 

Recording: (2679/ 9621) 
no we we yeah the only germantry ever saw were pretty p l w does 

Recording: (2680/ 9621) 
imparting some pretty good so 

Recording: (2681/ 9621) 
i like it better than a magazine 

Recording: (2682/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2683/ 9621) 
uh it was for me and a couple of other people and that was it 

Recording: (2684/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (2685/ 9621) 
well i am among the people i know i i you know we are i i think it is a pretty tolerant city um uh i know a lot of people who live down in old town you know in a very uh diverse environment and um um you know i just i just do not i do not personally know any races i do not think 

Recording: (2686/ 9621) 
um-hum yeahno there was more uh just getting you know going out uh but you know what is what are you doing saturday night nothing going to go out yeah all right we just go out you know and you know if you got a kiss or something you know or got big you got to feel you know i mean you know 

Recording: (2687/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2688/ 9621) 
yeah more yeah or more you know i i do not even know because to it is just such a huge problem and it is gotten so out of hand it is gonna be everybody all together that has to work it is gonna be the teachers and the government and everybody but they all have to have one common thing and it cracks me up because we are so concerned about ellen this this poor little kid everybody knows who he is but you know you look at our own kids we do not even care about our own kids as much as we care i mean here is this little kid who still has a living parent and and i do not understand that at all i mean that is just so i think the government gets involved in totally you know lay out of line and 

Recording: (2689/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2690/ 9621) 
um i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting so i am more practical you know it is a little more problems solving less running around and shooting things you know um it is like problem solving type you know little puzzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained it is you create your own entertainment 

Recording: (2691/ 9621) 
uh hide in your face when you and i i mean what you can 

Recording: (2692/ 9621) 
yeah i do not see that kind of raises at all 

Recording: (2693/ 9621) 
it is it is interesting too because when she had her other child uh her she had main she was at an auditor by then and she made arrangements that uh she might have to be in the hospital to get a final with one of her teachers that baby was born in march so i think she got the finals right in i think she got the finals right in or you know i it is just too much stress for me to even think about 

Recording: (2694/ 9621) 
even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal team and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost it much younger than seventeen you know ugh okay eleven twelve is like who you we would look alike go forget it but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and 

Recording: (2695/ 9621) 
in the march i do not have a plane ticket yeah i have a year old passbook 

Recording: (2696/ 9621) 
um-hum he was he did some assistant coach work at uh oh issue pro issue he really liked that um-hum 

Recording: (2697/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2698/ 9621) 
because apparently the apparently the get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in front of their face and they would be like 

Recording: (2699/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2700/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2701/ 9621) 
i was married but i did not have any kids once you have kids you are not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule but um yeah so i did not take off any time and then when i got my master is i went into an old friend of mine who teaches in worthington and he said oh i am the special ed director up there now we need a resource room teacher why do not you come up and interview for this position or that position or when i went up and interviewed for that position and got another position but anyway it all worked out 

Recording: (2702/ 9621) 
yeah yeah to sit on it she is not allowed on the couch but we had caught her last winter on the couch you know you come home and it is warm and hey there is a doggy bone up here hm 

Recording: (2703/ 9621) 
even they do not get faxed right a lot of the time uh 

Recording: (2704/ 9621) 
and i could not be part of a veterinar practice that uh did that 

Recording: (2705/ 9621) 
um they were one or two 

Recording: (2706/ 9621) 
oh sure yeah 

Recording: (2707/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (2708/ 9621) 
well that is what i am 

Recording: (2709/ 9621) 
so it is really weird because uh 

Recording: (2710/ 9621) 
um-hum right right and and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher i am supposed to get an hey what is wrong with you that is wrong with you 

Recording: (2711/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2712/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (2713/ 9621) 
of course that never happened 

Recording: (2714/ 9621) 
so it worked out well 

Recording: (2715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2716/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2717/ 9621) 
and if more and more people are getting older and older there will be more of needs for it i mean a lot of things there is gonna be more need for as people get older 

Recording: (2718/ 9621) 
humum no yeah i feel funny that um i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be so much simpler in life but you know it just just did not work out you know i was with his father for like nine years since i was sixteen and he just did not grow up once we had him he did not change like i changed and so 

Recording: (2719/ 9621) 
i do not want either of these people 

Recording: (2720/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2721/ 9621) 
yeah he is a real nice guy 

Recording: (2722/ 9621) 
yeah it just should be we are all aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now so you know but you can tell how your child is doing of course 

Recording: (2723/ 9621) 
uh seventeen and nineteen 

Recording: (2724/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2725/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2726/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2727/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2728/ 9621) 
this is the only society that labels them mentally ill 

Recording: (2729/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2730/ 9621) 
yes um-hum 

Recording: (2731/ 9621) 
but at the same time i mean i do not dislike them or anything for it i mean it is it is their choice i mean fact of the matter is it does not have any effect or anything on my life so 

Recording: (2732/ 9621) 
i picked up one kid he he had been in uh he was only about fifteen he was adopted and he ran away 

Recording: (2733/ 9621) 
no i mean like i said i think little kids are going to be little kids if that stuff was not on tv they are still going to act the same way they are still going to be walk around with toy guns things like that playing war or whatever 

Recording: (2734/ 9621) 
i mean i mean that is that is a lot of money for having a good time you know 

Recording: (2735/ 9621) 
telling you some people go nuts with the name i worked out at children is hospital when i was in college uh at the ear news and through out patient clinic a couple summers and i am telling you i had to put some names on the books like you would not believe iowa garling that was her name iowa garling and there was a little boy named freder zimpleas junior cocacola franklin i am supposed to fit that in a space like that no i am telling you 

Recording: (2736/ 9621) 
my name is 

Recording: (2737/ 9621) 
you know about seventy thousand dollars and uh um it was just a hard decision to make you know because i felt you know a lot more should have come from that i mean a joke and around you know i saw that adam steeler movie and big daddy he got his foot run over by a cab and there was a line in there pardon me where he says uh well i got my foot run over my cab and that cab was huge and a jury decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars 

Recording: (2738/ 9621) 
and a lot more um different suburbs so maybe it is it is going and and becoming a little wealthier 

Recording: (2739/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2740/ 9621) 
and i just sit there for a minute for it to get out i take it on out and sit on top of the line i said well mommy said a bad word i guess that uh mommy has to have children herald do not you now i get a piece of something in my house mommy 

Recording: (2741/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah there is almost nobody anymore that is willing to do uh just uh minuscule things unless you are going to be paid for it uh it is just always money money money money money money money money just a 

Recording: (2742/ 9621) 
is apartment 

Recording: (2743/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2744/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2745/ 9621) 
not way at least we could move around a little bit but uh 

Recording: (2746/ 9621) 
when i started dating it almost seventeen um so no i think i think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are um i i personally do not think a school can do it 

Recording: (2747/ 9621) 
you know i mean i liked earl bruce and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at he was a nicees man and when they did that i do not know if you know about that one they fired him the day before the michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row they fired him the day before that game 

Recording: (2748/ 9621)

Recording: (2752/ 9621) 
no but i have i have two daughters and two sons my and i heard my daughter is talking about they want to do something special for my sixty fifth birthday so they would give me a party on my sixties so i do not know what it is going to be but i think they will do they they talked about something the way of a trip so maybe something the three of us can do together so i am just 

Recording: (2753/ 9621) 
not at all 

Recording: (2754/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2755/ 9621) 
i do not remember because i could probably sell 

Recording: (2756/ 9621) 
whatever you will not get away with 

Recording: (2757/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2758/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (2759/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2760/ 9621) 
i went to it is the new high school there 

Recording: (2761/ 9621) 
i i have gone to one but i had a back problem that is how i dealt with it and it worked 

Recording: (2762/ 9621) 
um i do not i mean there definitely is that image of you know dallas and dallas to you i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourist like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a scholarship that is how i went there you know and i worked the whole time i was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grasp the fact that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california with brad pet and julie lewis and you know they are in the trailer and everything else and you know their accent and and i remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of around room watching this and they said like oh you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it is like in the south and i thought oh my gosh you know what an image to have of like the south and you know i was just kind of shocked at the but i think that they you know with you know people who are going to university there and things like that there is not necessarily that opinion maybe you know in a certain sector like when all you have heard is the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think you know most people like me or whatever they they well i should not say i like but you know people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about it but you know there is not just that blatant view i mean i think that it is um the consumption thing like i think a lot more realized now that you know i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like obviously when you give that a closer look at so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else in the news that said you know across the board we do not even break even we are like negative one or something 

Recording: (2763/ 9621) 
oh you are kidding 

Recording: (2764/ 9621) 
move was 

Recording: (2765/ 9621) 
people drive by and look around my little house there in the middle of it all 

Recording: (2766/ 9621) 
it is another thing that they are in their own in the house where the parents are every night and not going into the garage and finding things 

Recording: (2767/ 9621) 
um i have a dakota card it what it does is it makes it dec codes the dvd right away rather than sending it through the processor so it is it is a lot faster it does not depend on my process or time like it the movie does not skip or anything it it just goes straight throughum let us see no no nothing like that uh twice a month we have our technical module which are we hook up the tiny little you know green screen computers at the little old keyboards from like nineteen eighty five you know it is sit there and tinker on those 

Recording: (2768/ 9621) 
i live at uh one sixty one in cleveland area an apartment up there 

Recording: (2769/ 9621) 
i always hate it when people name their kids jimelia kenosha and i am like 

Recording: (2770/ 9621) 
and now they live in gay relationships 

Recording: (2771/ 9621) 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools i certainly did not want them to go to public schools and even when going to the high state um compared to miami university i saw different i see a difference as in the standards of the of the students uh but i believe and i have seen it with my son going out of the state that his morals that he is gained through his uh pre college years are staying with him uh and i am very grateful that there is uh a spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys guys and my daughter and son excuse me that uh you know they would come to me for answers and i do not know that is something that is probably the other problem is sometimes maybe it is the the uh siblings or the children do not have a parent to go to but again let me rate rate rate a rate we do not have a smooth marriage they always have difficult times and they always saw us saw us our spouse is crying together forgiving one another arguing with another just as much as you can have being humanized they saw that they saw the love for one other they saw over night where i would start care caring for my dad because my mother died instantly you know like short term an hour and now he had a stroke i did not know whether i stayed all their lives and i had learned all that and i had to carry him but then that is all my wife taking over some of my role at so we swung him that is what i said a team player we knew what we had to do uh my son might come on uh say well gee you know he might be smart off my wife will say eight that is your dad give him a respect 

Recording: (2772/ 9621) 
uh and uh her decisions are happening to her without her making them and um i think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her hands on 

Recording: (2773/ 9621) 
do whatever i want to some degree 

Recording: (2774/ 9621) 
but she does not believe it yeah yeah she is very pregnant um-hum yeah she yeah she could probably 

Recording: (2775/ 9621) 
and pretty much stuff like that and he would try to quote the bible and they would have a bible there with me and i would look it up and it would not it would not be right at all 

Recording: (2776/ 9621) 
yeah exactly so they so i i said well you know i went to i went to uh last year island because i i decided well i did not want to get any you know it is in texas so 

Recording: (2777/ 9621) 
uh actually he um in the fifties he had a jazz club and um it was real popular it it had food and live music um peggy lee saying there and some kind of name people i was not around but um and also we had a private club that um it was similar to the bunny club it was the key club where people had to pay a membership and it was in a real nice uh area downtown here and he is also uh owned um he is uh he is a broker he sells liquor licenses and things so he is owned several kinds of uh bars but originally he owned the um open the top steak house which is real popular and actually um and um sort of like three years later so mainly clubs and businesses but two really good restaurants 

Recording: (2778/ 9621) 
now she did she my exwife did uh i would prefer to her would have got continue going to school but she had some problems with some students and stuff 

Recording: (2779/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (2780/ 9621) 
well actually anybody can try you know there is a civil service exam you have to take and they place you on a list from that and like say if you have an eighty well everybody that takes it after you that gets an eighty one is gonna get get hired before you do and so you can take it again but if you score lower you have got to keep that lower score so that sometimes people are you know kind of apprehensive about doing that but uh once you pass that and then they say you know the government goes okay we are ready to hire a thousand people throughout the united states well each region there is regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region so they go down the list the first thirty and they call you know they write each one of them and say we are offering a position and do you want it or not and you know some of the people have said well i have been on the list for two years and i have a you know i have a job and i do not want it now you know so and then those people have to go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program which is really hard because at one time only forty percent of the people are making it through that 

Recording: (2781/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2782/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2783/ 9621) 
and you did not even have your violence and stuff like that i have never heard you know i am just using pop right now 

Recording: (2784/ 9621) 
we went back to our room and we watched a movie my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer and 

Recording: (2785/ 9621) 
no i have never been to that one that one has a big record that is a 

Recording: (2786/ 9621) 
say uh-huh 

Recording: (2787/ 9621) 
one of those 

Recording: (2788/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (2789/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2790/ 9621) 
you should be getting pretty near 

Recording: (2791/ 9621) 
yeah i think 

Recording: (2792/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2793/ 9621) 
but it takes away that big trip um we have been and then his brother got married in hawaii so we went out there so we have just done the honeymoon at disney world albuquerque a couple of times in a way but we have plans to go to europe he he wants to go to england and things like that and i want to we are looking into greece 

Recording: (2794/ 9621)

Recording: (2796/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2797/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2798/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (2799/ 9621) 
talk our own agree but uh that is how i see uh yeah on the regular crop they had when they were out there my parents was kids 

Recording: (2800/ 9621) 
i did not realize that 

Recording: (2801/ 9621) 
especially if you are waiting to go on a combat 

Recording: (2802/ 9621) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but you know with aids and that as rampant as is now and there is so many more women that have it um start off it was mostly men um women have got to know as at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (2803/ 9621) 
i remember a time when i was a brand new teacher i was maybe fifth or sixth year of teaching i still pretty new and it is john i said john what is your last name he said gets i said i do not feel like gas tell me your last name he said gas i said john i want to know your last name and he said g u e s s i am like oh sorry thank you 

Recording: (2804/ 9621) 
now that is part of the reason why 

Recording: (2805/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2806/ 9621) 
but in the winters when you know i mean i do not exercise that much 

Recording: (2807/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2808/ 9621) 
it is a no it is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how treadmill training affects the stimulation and people with a lot of quite injury 

Recording: (2809/ 9621) 
i appreciate your opinions but what were you asking did you have we seen a change in the politicians did through our lifetime was that particular your point 

Recording: (2810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2811/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2812/ 9621) 
how would uh do you think there is a heaven 

Recording: (2813/ 9621) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is it is really he he nurses them too so it is neat to watch 

Recording: (2814/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2815/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2816/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2817/ 9621) 
here in columbus yeah i have i have always lived in columbus yeah 

Recording: (2818/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2819/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2820/ 9621) 
i went to ou for about three months but i was just got out of school you know and i 

Recording: (2821/ 9621) 
i would just tell him that is just a feeling he is going through who he you know i i went to that where you know you you look at a woman and you are she is attractive to you you know but that is just something that is going through your mind and i think it is like the double getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would have just tell him that is something he is going through and that is wrong for him to do uh he you know he is a man and that would tell him god did not put too male in the earth and if he would still choose to do that though i would not hate them or dis on them or anything like that 

Recording: (2822/ 9621) 
the opportunity to serve with another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourselves instead of us others and i think as as we become older you start thinking about how uh much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your face it is not the materialistic things at the university here uh professors to be the thing 

Recording: (2823/ 9621) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going to have a a great time with your kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it is worth it 

Recording: (2824/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2825/ 9621) 
you have 

Recording: (2826/ 9621) 
i do it so 

Recording: (2827/ 9621) 
he will basic yeah he will basically tell you he do not have enough fathers to for me 

Recording: (2828/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (2829/ 9621) 
well as it turned out he expected us to play the solos but we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and uh i thought it came out pretty well i have it recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset 

Recording: (2830/ 9621) 
right you you you can not really ignore i have heard people say i refuse to read it as fast as well you got to know what is going on locally i am sorry but uh 

Recording: (2831/ 9621) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (2832/ 9621) 
yeah up on buffalo road 

Recording: (2833/ 9621) 
if if you did not own let us say on a school living you you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset and i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built into the rent uh at least it it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord uh and i do not i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh what the levy was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school evies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenary uh your democracy could go down the drain uh that was why thomas jefferson found it so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizen you will not understand the issues you know but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talked to some uh almost college age students and they do not see the relationship you can talk a logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (2834/ 9621) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (2835/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenting and everything you know there is something missing in the uh uh the child is life you know uh uh that he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be built in bombs and been they are based and mom and dad not know what were going on you know i mean uh it was just a a pain i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like i do not know uh eleven years old or something like that well it was accidental shooting and him and him and uh another friend of mine from the same same class you know uh they pulled a gun and shot him you know and he did not know know that damn thing was limited but and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some kid i guess that happened just here in town a couple of uh we could go or something like that you know where a guy shot another guy but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really you know and who is really the fault and who is really the he is guilty i do not know uh i would like to have uh not to date ever would have but if if one of the two that you have that columbine you know if they would have survived i would like to see what was going through their heads you know but that is something we never know 

Recording: (2836/ 9621) 
she did not she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (2837/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2838/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2839/ 9621) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones because every one of them is different 

Recording: (2840/ 9621) 
what is different is my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle it was i mean still as my elementary school is sitting there i went to for nine years and then north it is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oh and ten cheap billies i am right in where i always was i mean i am i was raised on cuomo avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (2841/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (2842/ 9621) 
it is in in education it is it is top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i will be going by the time it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for a small school and they just open up their phd program in education and they are also known for political science but it is a real conservative political science and like it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things um like that it is dry they have uh real strict visitation policies things like that and my thought is if you are in a if you are if you are considered adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember when i was a freshman in college it was we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (2843/ 9621) 
south pacific yeah 

Recording: (2844/ 9621) 
made you all the way around 

Recording: (2845/ 9621) 
i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that it it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other where for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i think that i i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like award rating things and i know that sounds kind of patty but just um i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 

Recording: (2846/ 9621) 
you can tell yeah i mean 

Recording: (2847/ 9621) 
everyone loses their funding 

Recording: (2848/ 9621) 
and then they said well since you are getting that well we will cut cut your pay back to what you would normally draw under the privacy program 

Recording: (2849/ 9621) 
i think yes especially the season 

Recording: (2850/ 9621) 
that that is nice to be to that is nothing that probably would compare to yours in australia gosh 

Recording: (2851/ 9621) 
well she she is interested in physical therapy is that what your wife is oh okay 

Recording: (2852/ 9621) 
it was not a huge shock it was not my first encounter with homosexuality 

Recording: (2853/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i can not say that that would be any difference with them 

Recording: (2854/ 9621) 
just mount tapes uh do printouts monitor systems uh if people have problems he will solve them 

Recording: (2855/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2856/ 9621) 
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite article every now and then um i said but when you get down to the meat of it it is the same thing and i said and that is where it comes down to the cafeteria for example they can put all you can folk mass you can do all this superficial stuff on a thing to make it more attracted and they do every every religion that makes it more attracted for it oh i was using water comfort well yeah but the bottom line is you are trying to still if you are a christian focus back to the bible 

Recording: (2857/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2858/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2859/ 9621) 
and then there was another girl who i really did not think was that smart she is kind of um in her blonde and she got in yeah 

Recording: (2860/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (2861/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2862/ 9621) 
you can find it all over the place 

Recording: (2863/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (2864/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2865/ 9621) 
and you went ahead and did it so 

Recording: (2866/ 9621) 
so uh it is been time for her from sharing to come home popular 

Recording: (2867/ 9621) 
he was from brooklyn 

Recording: (2868/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2869/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2870/ 9621) 
my 

Recording: (2871/ 9621) 
it is weird i i wish they would make it i do not want to say for well i think they do make it free um and i hate to say that but a little bit easier access um because i do not think it will cause people to have more sex i think they are gonna have it anyhow so it would only be better and safer for them 

Recording: (2872/ 9621) 
oh we do too we make vegetable soup and chili 

Recording: (2873/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2874/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2875/ 9621) 
you know what i mean 

Recording: (2876/ 9621) 
to some extent yeah but to some extent now because see when i was in the service it was a different time 

Recording: (2877/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2878/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2879/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (2880/ 9621) 
you have spelled every name you have read every name you have written every name practically there are not any that you have not heard of 

Recording: (2881/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2882/ 9621) 
yeah well 

Recording: (2883/ 9621) 
i do believe i do believe and i think maybe uh last year was your one of the younger generation have not you as you have grown older have not you look back sometimes and boy mom was right about that dad was right about that i think the older a child gets and that includes us too now that we are our age because we are i am almost as little as my mother was not she died i am older than my father was when he died i do believe i see now where just living life it would keep your eyes and ears open in your mind you are gonna have your mind open to receive what your eyes near is uh you learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help they help you to teach as you should always keep your mind open in school but there is a lot of things you are just not going to learn except by actual experience and living life and i believe that that is a lot of her ideas i know i started to say a while ago and i do not think i finished it i myself have these once getting only what i need versus all these little once in desires because i grew up in the depression and did not have these things consequently i have got a doll collection the teddy bear collection an angel collection record collection you would not believe a whole one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room but then the books i started when the kids were little because they did read at home and the libraries were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and the classical has kept the books and it is amazing but some of those grandchildren almost all of them they came over the house that they get bored they will go over the book they will go over that book and they will go over that book again will start looking for something to read so it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent now however my one son is gone too far he is got one rooms completely lined with books and a hallway part of it is just books and i do not know whether the kids ever go over and pick those up or not because they are always going to the library so you think it is what is taught at home that really count but we do not need all those material things and now i am sitting back and thinking well which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are going to keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money and trial you see what i mean you change your opinions change as you get older and you begin to look back i do not think i was ever a spendthirsty till the point that i did things foolishly some things i did do foolish but i mean you know on a overall basis 

Recording: (2884/ 9621) 
it can go up and like feed them and 

Recording: (2885/ 9621) 
just general manners 

Recording: (2886/ 9621) 
yeah and that is generation i am talking about those are the generations that they they went through the depression and so forth they they were the cash i i i i feel sorry for your generation uh which is my daughter is generation and uh private sons i because um i i i do not see how in the heck you know the wages are not going up that much prices are not consumerism is going up somewhere along the line uh the consumer is going to have to start get a little wiser and say 

Recording: (2887/ 9621) 
it is very hard 

Recording: (2888/ 9621) 
oh the white ones okay 

Recording: (2889/ 9621) 
anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me up especially i mean i think you kind of have a different level of awareness when you are a mother and you are sleeping in the boat with your infant because 

Recording: (2890/ 9621) 
oh you vacuumed oh it is so nice in here thank you you know and and that is pretty good you know there are a lot of people out there that that would not even notice if they of course then there are the days when i do not get around to it i know you must 

Recording: (2891/ 9621) 
they are but they are stupid laws 

Recording: (2892/ 9621) 
i said i did not want to see that you know i would much rather just have my own opinion what it is going to be like you know and go by what other people said 

Recording: (2893/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2894/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (2895/ 9621) 
my dad is the only weird well his some of his brothers and sisters are kind of out there too but 

Recording: (2896/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (2897/ 9621) 
yeah there were some of them ended up dropping out 

Recording: (2898/ 9621) 
trying to get that job 

Recording: (2899/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2900/ 9621) 
who can who can help you with that so 

Recording: (2901/ 9621) 
well it depends i think i would like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the oldphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems um because a lot of the people in that group are paid uh i get i get paid kind of a semi professional aspect thing where you get paid per service but um let us see so they have to balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for what the amount of music that they want to do and uh this last year we played a movement of a shah concert piece for four horns and orchestra and i was a little bit flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule at the beginning of the year because it is really hard to play and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody 

Recording: (2902/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2903/ 9621) 
difficult exactly getting 

Recording: (2904/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2905/ 9621) 
yeah well my little family all graduated megan was first in her class joe is rank first my brother phillips rink iowa was not he would have but they are all they are all straight four point 

Recording: (2906/ 9621) 
it is about the same 

Recording: (2907/ 9621) 
i know i guess we are amazing and 

Recording: (2908/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2909/ 9621) 
no it is in the it is in the ag college but uh why it is there i do not know it is of of how they fit it in there but it is dealing with construction management 

Recording: (2910/ 9621) 
but uh but even so uh we were on this and uh germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us so we did not go out in the daylight hardly at all 

Recording: (2911/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2912/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (2913/ 9621) 
clumbus um-hum i went to i ended up at an alternative school system all along i was i got into the lottery they used i i made it into every school i applied for 

Recording: (2914/ 9621) 
i mean we went in there one day and you know i explained the whole thing to her and then she puts off some kind of excuse the administrator she says well we do not need problem students like yourself blah blah blah i said what problem 

Recording: (2915/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2916/ 9621) 
oh no never have 

Recording: (2917/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2918/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2919/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2920/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (2921/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i am saying 

Recording: (2922/ 9621) 
than to do that 

Recording: (2923/ 9621) 
you are allowed to have guests for the same sex like you say like i do not live in the dorm i was assuming i did if i were if i had a girl come from home to visit me i would have to either sneak her in and like just hope we did not get caught or have her stay at a friend is 

Recording: (2924/ 9621) 
my roommate 

Recording: (2925/ 9621) 
the ultimate would probably be a part time thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time we are we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or so which is they get a little bit of both the world so 

Recording: (2926/ 9621) 
i she is always trying to recruit people to come and visit but it is like a two hour drive and then everybody is busy you know that is four hours of driving and um i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but 

Recording: (2927/ 9621) 
i was at virginia and i was not even in virginia it was a hundred thousand you know and uh i loved that but i then i came back and i live in oldentansas village which is right on the river and it is very uh very scenic very beautiful 

Recording: (2928/ 9621) 
yes um-hum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean there there are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when you know people are kind of like oh clark you know there is nothing to do there i find myself defending clumus a lot more now than 

Recording: (2929/ 9621) 
home back um yeah i am sure that was useful to for people that did not cook or do anything showed them how to turn a oven on or 

Recording: (2930/ 9621) 
um that was in sixty nine when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was 

Recording: (2931/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2932/ 9621) 
because there is no fear being caught by the parents there is 

Recording: (2933/ 9621) 
um so they sort of send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (2934/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (2935/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (2936/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2937/ 9621) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (2938/ 9621) 
and to me that is considered suburbia so and to me ashe is considered the sticks i mean there is people there is amish buggy is that go by 

Recording: (2939/ 9621) 
uh i can not i can not believe he came back 

Recording: (2940/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (2941/ 9621) 
i talk to her every day 

Recording: (2942/ 9621) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get to travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really want to see chicago is not that far washington is not that far uh new york uh you know i do not get to new york that often but uh you know i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i want to go to the trouble 

Recording: (2943/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (2944/ 9621) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be another thing above you know if there is that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (2945/ 9621) 
be in turned away 

Recording: (2946/ 9621) 
his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (2947/ 9621) 
uh probably 

Recording: (2948/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2949/ 9621) 
but now it seems like people are just like i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said uh he grew up in the bronx 

Recording: (2950/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2951/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (2952/ 9621) 
so i almost bought one um a a lot couple weeks ago in fact i went i went into contract on it with this guy this year old man who is it was for his mother who was near nineties and a retirement was on ralph forest which is north and i made this this slow offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i feel like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i the baby coming and we are going to be busy and i did not want to get involved in it and so i made this offer and then he counted back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he came back at ninety six and i said uh you know i thought oh god i have to worry about it he is never gonna come to so i wrote back and said you know i appreciate your ever but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was really the only thing i could i could do and i did not even give him a time to respond because i just assumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2953/ 9621) 
uh i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that as being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too over powerful as far as the number of guys being out there that are violent i mean it is something that unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2954/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2955/ 9621) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy cosy i have a 

Recording: (2956/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2957/ 9621) 
i just was going down like 

Recording: (2958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2959/ 9621) 
um and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that is still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um see i do not think i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger and more comfortable movie theaters and and that kind of stuff it has not really 

Recording: (2960/ 9621) 
but usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2961/ 9621) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least let us us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that as you increase your knowledge you are far better off than to stay in this little hole where you are this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (2962/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (2963/ 9621) 
uh-huh parties did not change at all 

Recording: (2964/ 9621) 
well uh the first the first thing is clintonville 

Recording: (2965/ 9621) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (2966/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (2967/ 9621) 
that is really cool yeah yeah 

Recording: (2968/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2969/ 9621) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general or family 

Recording: (2970/ 9621) 
put bathrooms and kitchens and stuff 

Recording: (2971/ 9621) 
i think columbus is really interesting how how it what develops compared to like i do not know just like how indianapolis like how columbus is is a a a real standard midwest city just how it is designed and laid out compared to like philadelphia you know or just be like when it was settled and when it was made and just how like where the streets are more it is all like planned out more as opposed to like in in phillie or places like that more east coast it is like the roads parts of them are real small and like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so it is kind of interesting i mean i think it is also i like the urban is fall of columbia is how um the just the suburbs develop and how it is is more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that is really big like our like columbus is downtown and it is really odd too i mean everything there is nothing to do down there it is all businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean there is like couple restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and here or more of a 

Recording: (2972/ 9621) 
but i mean it is was nothing too serious or violent i mean 

Recording: (2973/ 9621) 
so everybody is trying to be like everyone else 

Recording: (2974/ 9621) 
oh you are trying to ask an easy one do you that is that is really 

Recording: (2975/ 9621) 
and they do not wear like the loud how i even shirts in the in you know the shorts and the camera that that they do not do that 

Recording: (2976/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2977/ 9621) 
yeah not that they could have stopped it but they they should have known what was going on i i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially with these kids who are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways you know that they are you know going uh turning a different you know i just i blame them though 

Recording: (2978/ 9621) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (2979/ 9621) 
yeah which is good for me because i do not ever go there anyway so 

Recording: (2980/ 9621) 
and you do not have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image 

Recording: (2981/ 9621) 
and then once a month we will have a leadership module which is uh the business ethics part and you know say gold setting and that type of thing and then once a month we will just have like tonight oh it is pizza and like just just discuss basic and just general things like events coming up we had we planned the flowers at nearfield last weekend and the weekend before that is it i do not know i can not wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv i have played to those you see the the jack nicholis on thatno i i do not want to watch it for the gulf war oh i just want to turn that on and see it occasionally 

Recording: (2982/ 9621) 
nobody around not but land 

Recording: (2983/ 9621) 
i would not 

Recording: (2984/ 9621) 
yeah i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of them is from their parents but um it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not realize you know they are old guns that they call suspect and they do not realize where they are going i mean that amazes me um but there is always going to be the under world and different ways that kids and people can get guns and it is sad i do not know how we could ever limit that but there is so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering where are they all coming from um i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that uh not just a safety lock but you know you it is like identification thing you know 

Recording: (2985/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (2986/ 9621) 
oh that was a football game deal 

Recording: (2987/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (2988/ 9621) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and that on top of it those people that participate in the um sponsors are just as bad 

Recording: (2989/ 9621) 
excuse me well typically what i observe is conflict you know with mom most of the time uhuhsome of them but they said you know you might run into a case where you know the family is abusing uh the child you know but i did not run into that 

Recording: (2990/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2991/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2992/ 9621) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2993/ 9621) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2994/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (2995/ 9621) 
this falls the first time i will be sending my port full you know 

Recording: (2996/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (2997/ 9621) 
uh no i do really believe that they if they would have something like that instead of some of the even those shows there are no good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes i turn them off for some of the stupid things they do 

Recording: (2998/ 9621) 
right yeah it was like oh this makes sense and you might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this so i will get that little slice and pick the so that worked out 

Recording: (2999/ 9621) 
watching it for a while period and then since d space night left i needed a little star trek fixed every once in a while so i started watching it i also do not have cable so uh it is on upn and fifty three does not come in terribly well so it uh i mean sometimes it is like uh i do not wanna kind of see what is going on but 

Recording: (3000/ 9621) 
uh i was interested in going out to california and i have been out there several times but it was supposed to be uh why was the line i just did not moving out with my mother 

Recording: (3001/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3002/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3003/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3004/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (3005/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (3006/ 9621) 
we should look at it as as a sport 

Recording: (3007/ 9621) 
yeah yeah because if she was they are charging her two bucks down there and i told her i says you need to really not get twenty dollars out of the time because i said you need to get like sixty or eighty because it says you get eighty bucks out you are going to pay eight dollars for it twenty bucks at a time but if you get eighty bucks out you are going to get two bucks and she goes but if i have eighty dollars i will spend it and i says well you have a foot lock or a lock on it put seventy dollars in there and have ten on you and she is like oh and i said you know the reason i know that is because that is what dad is got to do i said i can not carry money or i will spend it you know 

Recording: (3008/ 9621) 
that he remembers he he remembers the stepfathers and and that kind of thing just not a good stuff 

Recording: (3009/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3010/ 9621) 
they are just fine to go on strike anytime they want to however how they behave during the strike was just disgusting i mean 

Recording: (3011/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3012/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3013/ 9621) 
it was like five or six different doctors and so she is learned a lot more now the cancer because she had never been in on college at all so it was always just trauma patients or open heart bypassations things like that so it is been a whole new learning experience for her too 

Recording: (3014/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (3015/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3016/ 9621) 
i mean that is a neighborhood mall and 

Recording: (3017/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (3018/ 9621) 
it i i do not know how to tell you that um i mean it it is 

Recording: (3019/ 9621) 
um i am a luther and and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3020/ 9621) 
uh yeah so i think she is getting a better education than he did not but it is because she is doing the work and she knows she is expected to and has to and he my son is the kind he would rather play than work and so he he wrote a lot and 

Recording: (3021/ 9621) 
that is it oh 

Recording: (3022/ 9621) 
i was up i was only on the old field a few times but one time we had a uh second lieutenant up there who was very uh convenient i guess as a good award as any 

Recording: (3023/ 9621) 
because i mean you could actually grow that stuff but it is kind of wintery now so can not grow nothing right now um 

Recording: (3024/ 9621) 
my mom is a severe alcohol think 

Recording: (3025/ 9621) 
for someone to actually stay in a class if you must feed your baby they are going to have a higher iq than if you do not i thought 

Recording: (3026/ 9621) 
well you can carry a weapon here in columbus i can carry a weapon right now as long as it is out in the open 

Recording: (3027/ 9621) 
yeah a lot more 

Recording: (3028/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3029/ 9621) 
take a lot of time 

Recording: (3030/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i think it was just a political thing 

Recording: (3031/ 9621) 
now i have parked over here on uh let me see the a section goes back in 

Recording: (3032/ 9621) 
like there would be kids saying yes maam yes maam yes maam in class and then they are out there smoking at the cars or cut school and stuff 

Recording: (3033/ 9621) 
and it would take for like years i would think to implement the program successfully 

Recording: (3034/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (3035/ 9621) 
um-hum life skills 

Recording: (3036/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3037/ 9621) 
i feel like there is no there is not a lot you really can really do with that 

Recording: (3038/ 9621) 
no then you would not be too familiar with everything 

Recording: (3039/ 9621) 
we are crazy 

Recording: (3040/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3041/ 9621) 
yeah so she said she is going to be catching the disability bus out here you know after third round time she is going to ride that bus 

Recording: (3042/ 9621) 
no i have no idea where he was uh and at the time my motherinlaw was in a nursing home had alzheimer is and my fatherinlaw was in the hospital 

Recording: (3043/ 9621) 
um-hum uh they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you do not want to do it and most usually i just put location i do not want to go certain places uh 

Recording: (3044/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3045/ 9621) 
i i think it is because uh when i i was a sophomore in high school before it had gone by me that taba and flat b any relation to this stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagram and um but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they are exposed to you know in movies and everything and you know just tv just daily life um i they are a lot more aware they they have i uh they they go into it with a lot of of uh myths and misappre hections but they definitely have thoughts about it and and i think they i think they need to know 

Recording: (3046/ 9621) 
yeah like when i need things and i call them up i need diapers and i have wiped any twenty dollars yeah he is there for me for that financially yeah he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3047/ 9621) 
with their eye or the car 

Recording: (3048/ 9621) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3049/ 9621) 
yeah it is well basically it is like a it is about the size of a very small hotel room and then it is got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub and there is like these are like uh the room with the therapy which is a little box for me while about what is that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is enough room where people can come into down there is like a fulled out couch bed for whoever is in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3050/ 9621) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior you go in the morning and your senior you go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cruise center and then you go 

Recording: (3051/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3052/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3053/ 9621) 
just because you know who was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the textbook that they would not know how to do it you know like where if people did not have their notes like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um so i think it it is uh when people have real enthusiasm and like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not the same every day not just like a lecture and then we do homework and turn it in like you know it is like we do like like history class we do like role role playing things and like 

Recording: (3054/ 9621) 
yeah exactly which is one of the things that i ran into architecture where i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 

Recording: (3055/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3056/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3057/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3058/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3059/ 9621) 
but it is a uh smaller basic school you know in say well so 

Recording: (3060/ 9621) 
they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pencil and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (3061/ 9621) 
and there is people like that today still you know but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh uh and uh sit down and make a visit to them every week make a part of life and develop a friendship 

Recording: (3062/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3063/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3064/ 9621) 
yeah i think they are trying to do more i am hoping they will 

Recording: (3065/ 9621) 
i went back and did a one year um schooling to get my nursing license i became an elfian so i do not have a degree my husband has a degree i put him through school i finished finished his private school 

Recording: (3066/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3067/ 9621) 
no commitment these guys have commitment and you see guys out there they want they go further possibly in their careers and professionals others want to maybe fill something whatever it is you ask each person in individual what is it drives you and that is the thing i get so perturban interviews they ask somebody and and somebody comes back and say you know what i mean yeah yeah what did he no i do not get inside the guy is mind i do not want to what did he mean you know what i mean yeah i do not know what you mean you know played dumb it pulled out of them what do you mean uh michael redd what do you plan on doing after school i mean when i was growing up they used to give the great play average in the major of the of the uh the student of the student athlete 

Recording: (3068/ 9621) 
huhuh you talk to a computer always you deal with a computer 

Recording: (3069/ 9621)

um-hum me too 

Recording: (3072/ 9621) 
byebye 

Recording: (3073/ 9621) 
i can not say you know i can not say that it is an expectation i i i still say that it has to come from the top down 

Recording: (3074/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3075/ 9621) 
yeah exactly you can bring that in house i think i mean i do not know i might go out like like we should and be completely wrong so 

Recording: (3076/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3077/ 9621) 
a little bit of both i think i looked into some phoenix i went to the library checked out some phoenix tapes let him watch those because kids love to watch things and just reading with him and going over things and it is it is been amazing just to see it is like the light bug comes on and 

Recording: (3078/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3079/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3080/ 9621) 
well yeah i could have just took them out in the woods and whooped them but what is that going to prove 

Recording: (3081/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3082/ 9621) 
it is just like forty of any other kind it is plenty 

Recording: (3083/ 9621) 
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (3084/ 9621) 
um i i took a class for more processing more more processing one too i took those and um i tell you what i can not remember is they taught me how to balance a checkbook out 

Recording: (3085/ 9621) 
oh is he 

Recording: (3086/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3087/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3088/ 9621) 
oh sure 

Recording: (3089/ 9621) 
you do not mind 

Recording: (3090/ 9621) 
um i probably would like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3091/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3092/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3094/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (3095/ 9621) 
and i have got friends that do that and i just i do not i do not feel right i do not want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff that is no way huhuh 

Recording: (3096/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3097/ 9621) 
i know this is your halls 

Recording: (3098/ 9621) 
so we are kind of doing that and i figure i am probably going to wait tables at night and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (3099/ 9621) 
well he is uh export cars illegal 

Recording: (3100/ 9621) 
multatoryers the way i was raised um are you planning on staying home after you uh 

Recording: (3101/ 9621) 
that is that is yeah environmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they found out that the full dominance does not take over until about age eight 

Recording: (3102/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3103/ 9621) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parents were not there and they had to clean they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feel that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know kids a lot of them who will have when they parents have money and um both parents work i am not sure if the combine if both parents worked but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no 

Recording: (3104/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (3105/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3106/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3107/ 9621) 
but uh her mother stayed with us for several uh two or three years and she was a babysitter for our oldest boy 

Recording: (3108/ 9621) 
and it really is not though because once because i think it is actually it is really free not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can go on with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life for everyone 

Recording: (3109/ 9621) 
oh yeah uh 

Recording: (3110/ 9621) 
yeah i saw that patient in the morning 

Recording: (3111/ 9621) 
i am a freelance artist um a illustrated um in fact um marketing communications for a high state is one is one of my big clients and um uh i also i also have various part time jobs with the medical insurance 

Recording: (3112/ 9621) 
i know it is connected to like you know england because it is like i guess that is i guess that is uh i maybe like england owned it once so that 

Recording: (3113/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3114/ 9621) 
and uh it did not hurt may not you know uh i think just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you know at your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in a neighborhood even you know how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go cars we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3115/ 9621) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3116/ 9621) 
um-hum and some conservative values to you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they are doing a very good job of that 

Recording: (3117/ 9621) 
uh it is not a presidential issue candidate issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (3118/ 9621) 
you would not have even stopped he is sitting there going what are you doing with this guy and what is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested man he took my necklace tried to take my radios too and uh you know i kind of do that in there and make it sound bad but that was on my way to work during i did not want anything bad to happen to me or him you know all in all the cop you know put guy in handguns put him back a car he goes well do you want to press charges and at that time i was a little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let them out of the car i will be the best oh man the cop said something is i never forget he said i would but that would probably have to be my job to do if we was living like that i was like god man riding a king all over again not 

Recording: (3119/ 9621) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but uh that is interesting uh uh you know when the when the first when the uh when the time began you know according to life uh what i had believed in and everything you know was man or woman got married you know and and reason they got married is because of procreation you know keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i have no problem with a man being with a man or would not be able to but uh if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3120/ 9621) 
motherly instinct towards you know oh now i am like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows i am like that one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (3121/ 9621) 
can you really 

Recording: (3122/ 9621) 
see and i can not eat seafood but i tried some once once with my went to las vegas with my dad and i we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind of glad she did not um the the snow fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out to a rash i mean it was like a heat rash 

Recording: (3123/ 9621) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times when you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh you know there is an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way and i really meant for you to turn left instead of right and you may come back and go uh do you do you mean left or right there and i go yes it is correct turn left you know you know so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kind of goes a long way and the pilots the same way they are the most often they are you know pretty decent 

Recording: (3124/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3125/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3126/ 9621) 
yeah uh it to me that is sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you have done it that the kid did and you do not want them to do it again and let it go they are suspended and i do not know of course i would probably say this i got this version of this story from the clumbus to spatch so it is probably not the whole story yeahyeah it does 

Recording: (3127/ 9621) 
it is that is why i quit 

Recording: (3128/ 9621) 
it is like we do not have one at home because we are worried and 

Recording: (3129/ 9621) 
yeah because i have like a problem with getting to know people you know like uh shy at first 

Recording: (3130/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3131/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (3132/ 9621) 
yeah you know that is pretty much what we have made to do you know back in the pioneer days you did not have this crap with the kid going you get fix me some canned ravioli or you gave that kid a shotgun and he went out there and killed his own that is an interesting thing i just saw that is an interesting thing i just saw in the paper in the newsweek i was reading that and 

Recording: (3133/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3134/ 9621) 
uh take how old you 

Recording: (3135/ 9621) 
which i feel has been completely completely devised in america because of the effects of the cold war uh i have inherited this world where there were of uh uh where am i going with this um i mean the generation before has had like vietnam the protestors against it and i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before but and when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear because i am not exactly sure where i am going with it i am very cynical of of about about the world i have inherited uh because i see a world in which my political views have been silence by fifty years of of you know like international politics uh and sort of like propaganda um that says you know like to be left of a certain point as bad i i do not know like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like almost like calling someone a communist in in the forties um where as i am very cynical about that because they they feel that it was not it it is been a cultural process that has been developed and now i am being handed this current situation which i see as completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is cynical the reason i am cynical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustice of the past or not the the the bureaucracy i mean i and it also applies in terms of things like the cold war and stuff but that is why i am cynical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit i do not know i feel kind of preachy like this is my position 

Recording: (3136/ 9621) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (3137/ 9621) 
oh that is where have you been 

Recording: (3138/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (3139/ 9621) 
was that right 

Recording: (3140/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3141/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3142/ 9621) 
have some with theyeah yeahyeahpicking something like that i think it was around two years ago it was allowing things to be done off a round of a letter or something like that and i wanted that or just so i do not think we should be going anywhere elsei have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the the total destruction of our center cities uh and i say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just cities the size of columbus which is the largest one to say to ohio now but i am talking places like washington courthouse which maybe have fifteen thousand or um uh wadsworth which maybe have eighteen thousand uh this kinds of things being developed on the peripheral the cities is just totally destroying those and a consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not do not know our neighbors at all anymore this uh it is quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them uh and that all applies to the hilarious question as i see it and i think also that uh it it is it is a very very major financial uh gain for the developer who are doing it and it is going to therefore harm uh the many many areas just that affected such as north north north north what is the name of the shop uh north by north and i yeah north and i can not even say that okay 

Recording: (3143/ 9621) 
and that was two two well back when i was a kid they had barrels of the bands at the mall 

Recording: (3144/ 9621) 
oh boy they are just really fun people to deal with 

Recording: (3145/ 9621) 
yeah because i mean five years went by like 

Recording: (3146/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (3147/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3148/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3149/ 9621) 
well that is right now a lot of it 

Recording: (3150/ 9621)

Recording: (3151/ 9621)

Recording: (3152/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (3153/ 9621) 
and i understand that mentality now because i went back but i will tell you the reason i left was it sounds stupid but he took my teddy bear which i loved and i have had for not since i was a child but at least five years at that time and he just he knew i loved it 

Recording: (3154/ 9621) 
that is going to well i might make national news i just

Recording: (3159/ 9621) 
oh uh-huh well it is because i was going to say what you are talking about traveling you will be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling i know like my husband goes to europe and goes you know he goes to california every month and and you know he goes as little as possible but the point is if i if we wanted to be traveling he could be going a lot more a lot longer now he just goes for you know a couple days uh time just to get back here because i do not like him to have to go and he does not want to be away from us but your husband you will be in a position you can he can latch on to something where you will be able to have lots of opportunities to travel 

Recording: (3160/ 9621) 
and plus the mental health aspect of it the other thing 

Recording: (3161/ 9621) 
um sort of like make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do what they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (3162/ 9621) 
now i worked at the library when i was a student 

Recording: (3163/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3164/ 9621)

Recording: (3172/ 9621) 
but that need to sound to me so it doesnt matter 

Recording: (3173/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3174/ 9621) 
to simpleest things 

Recording: (3175/ 9621) 
well we figure in a few years he will um 

Recording: (3176/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3177/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3178/ 9621) 
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh when they were planning this thing in with uh with the high state to uh you know like had the shot stain center down at uh down closer to downtown or or something like uh and play happier ball games there or something like that but but on high state do not need to you know they got their own stuff so 

Recording: (3179/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3180/ 9621) 
well i do not think they should be responsible but i think um kids go to school and they need role models good teachers um and i think schools have gotten a lot better about that it seemed like in the late eighties early nineties you know the schools a lot of them were really bad um i think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that he is learned a lot um and i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is a way to have to do with money and them not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked in all these big large classrooms and it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in and collect together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say oh what is going on in your life what is your what is the problem you know that that is not really should be their role but uh if they care enough they should call the parents and say look we are worried about your son he misses a lot of school or he is starting to dress really you know i sometimes it should not be the dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if they do not want to be in sports that is fine there is so many different things that they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and you know but um unfortunately i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up this lack of what the parents can do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of me until you got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3181/ 9621) 
getting so congested that is 

Recording: (3182/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3183/ 9621) 
and it is like i i like how like i thought about going to aeach but it was it was real expensive and like um i do not know but just because the and and schools more of a nontraditional type where they give you like evaluation and you do not get grades like and so so then it that is what i heard like in india where the professor writes uh a couple page paper on your like performance on the corner and that that really shows that and that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved and noticing what you are doing as opposed to just like uh some kid in his class you know 

Recording: (3184/ 9621) 
well there is been quite a change in the attitude of the general public i think as far as women working away from home is concerned and uh i do not know actually she worked in an office when our first boy was just small 

Recording: (3185/ 9621) 
well and 

Recording: (3186/ 9621) 
you 

Recording: (3187/ 9621) 
no it is not 

Recording: (3188/ 9621) 
um most of my painting is uh was again some funny most of my painting are of uh images from star wars 

Recording: (3189/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those and my father would not allow it because uh it was integrated 

Recording: (3190/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3191/ 9621) 
there is a mild fear it seems that cops always 

Recording: (3192/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (3193/ 9621) 
yeah i could 

Recording: (3194/ 9621) 
it is where byo and fromatics was about a year or two ago 

Recording: (3195/ 9621) 
and i tell them writing is not an event it is a process it is like getting your braces put on you go in one time and they might pull a couple teeth and you go in the next time then i put that low wire on then you go and the next time then i put the lower ones on or part of them and the next time then they put on more and then one time they will tighten them a little but it is a process that happens over a period of three years it is not an event they think they can sit down and write okay i am done i am like i do not think so yeah grading is 

Recording: (3196/ 9621) 
for the medical insurance 

Recording: (3197/ 9621) 
but it is like they have it is like a democracy over there it it was very they you know it is like they do not have like a king and queen and 

Recording: (3198/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3199/ 9621) 
yeah and there is a a certain amount of uh gun laws that i actually did not get into until i saw that here in ohio it is with a long gun or a handgun you have to be eighteen but other places like texas there is no minimum age on owning a you know rifle or a handgun and you are looking like god man you pack just imagine this little six year old walking into the store packing oh man 

Recording: (3200/ 9621) 
i do 

Recording: (3201/ 9621) 
you know afraid we are going to get them addicted to the internet or you know because the nintendo and those type of things are bad enough they are a good babysitter but you need to limit it 

Recording: (3202/ 9621) 
cliff public 

Recording: (3203/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3204/ 9621) 
but then there was pretty much just nuking up blood and passing out a lot 

Recording: (3205/ 9621) 
for about five years 

Recording: (3206/ 9621) 
or been around you know but um more i think doctors should more look on that avenue you know that it possibly be something else like that i have never had a well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it is um prescriptions and things you know i mean that you have taken but they i do not know i think a lot of things have to do with food dollar cheese anymore i really do 

Recording: (3207/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (3208/ 9621) 
okay now i have brewers very two i am sorry dover very two brewers belgium and then train 

Recording: (3209/ 9621) 
all right well i was born in columbia i am twenty seven uh graduated from high state 

Recording: (3210/ 9621) 
he never said a thing again like oh okay we went for the big bucks we went for the time off everybody makes their choices now you got to live with them 

Recording: (3211/ 9621) 
uh uh politics i mean we we grew up or came of age after the cold war was over um i am very cynical about this i have fairly leftist uh political uh the stance 

Recording: (3212/ 9621) 
it is but it that was good for new orleans to have that i mean i think it it was great to have it there and i think a lot of people did enjoy going there because there is not very many women tournaments that come around here 

Recording: (3213/ 9621) 
she would pamper the kids and well from where we live to we live just all i do not know whether you are acquainted with the north end of the columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfare and uh we lived about a a block on a half off of indianola and then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drug store and a farmer shop and a a ten cent store theater i forget a couple of other shops and when oron was about i do not know five or maybe six or seven years old he had been explicit told that he was not to go up there at all so one day grand maureen will gave him i do not know what quarter or something and that burned his part i told him now i do not know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or whether he went up on his own but he went up to the store and uh i think i do not know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she found out it is not there so when you when i came home she told me what had happened i said well i just can not be so i took him downstairs and paddled him have never been anything more said about it since then 

Recording: (3214/ 9621) 
it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings so i mean there is uh i mean yeah the animal therapy is a very good thing my dog has been very um supportive and very you know like you say the unconditional love part you know i mean how you could you could you could leave for a week and come back and they are they are like okay i am glad you are back you know 

Recording: (3215/ 9621) 
i did not quite understand here who are you 

Recording: (3216/ 9621) 
because i like johnson better if you really want to know but there ai not anyplace that they will fish up there well is that good or not 

Recording: (3217/ 9621) 
i love that 

Recording: (3218/ 9621) 
i think about putting my life on book but i do not think they make that many pages have a twenty thousand page book and ten yeah ten thousand will be an introduction well it will start it 

Recording: (3219/ 9621) 
i was not born here but i was raised here 

Recording: (3220/ 9621) 
so that is basically what we have been doing we have been progressing for fifteen years and uh i am probably the say that our agency is probably the only agency other than maybe this highway patrol we work out with them but i think our we are the only ones who have their own wearing cable people 

Recording: (3221/ 9621) 
or a crop and discover boys either way 

Recording: (3222/ 9621) 
i mean you kind of suffer your own consequences more rather than having society like yell at you for it 

Recording: (3223/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3224/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3225/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (3226/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3227/ 9621) 
it is all out of stuff like that and a lot of 

Recording: (3228/ 9621) 
and if i was in the same situation i would be doing the same thing so 

Recording: (3229/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3230/ 9621) 
i think it is more just a family preference i i prefer a family um 

Recording: (3231/ 9621) 
and that was pretty dumb but 

Recording: (3232/ 9621) 
gear your writing for a fourth grader and everyone will that you every body that is going to read the mema will be able to read it 

Recording: (3233/ 9621) 
no it did not as a matter of fact i told my parents you know the university is handling it so well by not giving them the money because they do not deserve it you know and 

Recording: (3234/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3235/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (3236/ 9621) 
it is a lot of memories 

Recording: (3237/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3238/ 9621) 
no no it does not 

Recording: (3239/ 9621) 
so it is like it is like in the parks you know like you know we like grand canyon you know you can feed them you know you know like junk food and mcdonald is 

Recording: (3240/ 9621) 
yeah he says a lot of racial slars like that he is really homephobic 

Recording: (3241/ 9621) 
yeah i thought that was interesting uh so it is it values you know the the christian values thing uh i did not have a problem with we had little problems like my son had to learn the hillary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us to write it down for us because we did not know and they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marked up and we and we did not yeah little things like that but it was not a problem uh there was a problem for well they signed for a while because the police they had there would not let him take community and all the other kids were taking commune and that is pretty much the priest decides that and he and he felt singled out and he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with it uh but it has to been a problem uh i am not a religious person myself but i am not against it and if i and maybe i have justified it to myself by saying well the teaching values 

Recording: (3242/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3243/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (3244/ 9621) 
although janet you just said yesterday that people are so overweight in columbus because there is not very much to do that actually 

Recording: (3245/ 9621) 
yeah and because i back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying attention a lot you know like i read the columbia batch every day and i read us news and world report for my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (3246/ 9621) 
did you teach at university level 

Recording: (3247/ 9621) 
uh that uh well well i know about the grill and masks and and uh you know i it is a a women is organization uh to promote women artists and and to uh object to the to the male hierarchy you know the the only only men get are in the museums and only men get the big gallery shows and stuff like that 

Recording: (3248/ 9621) 
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where you are going to put it 

Recording: (3249/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3250/ 9621) 
and i think i am gonna well i really like the rising military because it shows discipline responsibility respect for you go to a columbus public school and the kids will rash out on substitute teachers i think it is really crazy um i think you should have a lot more respect for your elders your adults 

Recording: (3251/ 9621) 
and uh he let me fire it one one range but i got about fifty or seventy five yards from the what we were shooting at 

Recording: (3252/ 9621) 
oh uh place on some land with woods and uh yeah water and things like that 

Recording: (3253/ 9621) 
oh yeah i have no idea 

Recording: (3254/ 9621) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was right or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (3255/ 9621) 
i do not know uh maybe i think maybe if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more like i mean i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it um so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we got to like think about our child is future or whatever but really teachers are paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get like more of a respect but like it is just like like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like in and especially in adolescents too like really influence like how you are as a person and like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subject you are going to hate that subject you know and like if you have good teachers you are going to love it i mean there really influences too like how like what you want to do with your life you know and people do not really knowledge that too much 

Recording: (3256/ 9621) 
um kind of uh i mean there was something i was really into uh until i do not know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which point things sort of switched to you know like i do not know like killer robot is or something like transformers that kind of thing uh in high school i uh i do not know i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys and like star wars is fun i am gonna watch star wars more often i had them on tape so i started watching them and got i i do not wanna say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the paying uh i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective uh so it was like my first couple of years of college uh from sort of the second half high school to my first couple of years of college i just sort of just i do not know i like the story um 

Recording: (3257/ 9621) 
because they kicked me out for some dumb reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking a blame 

Recording: (3258/ 9621) 
um you get priority for scheduling you have to apply for it like separately and i think you have to have like certain um class standing and sat scores where you can write an easy and they will what you want anyway um let us see you get priority for scheduling i think you go after first the athletes and disabilities and that is it 

Recording: (3259/ 9621) 
no because honestly like gore to me is like a best out of a bad bunch like if i have to choose i will choose gore but that does not mean i am necessarily like he is most in line with a lot of my style with a lot of my views not talking about i am not completely liberal on everything like there is certain things i guess maybe because going to school in actuallyland it just rubs off on you there is certain things like i am not so liberal about but i do not really like georgia seems so dry i am just not it is hard to i think it would be hard to get people enthusiastic for them 

Recording: (3260/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3261/ 9621) 
and he does have a responsibility but i think there could be a line drawn how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been you know 

Recording: (3262/ 9621) 
because the mother um he played her because he was with me and you know if and she just was like forget him i do not want him to be around my child and the other one she is the older she is they she is like ten and um he says that because his daughter do not call he only she only calls for when she wants things so he does not you know he will he will get whatever he can for her when she calls but he does not spend time with her 

Recording: (3263/ 9621) 
uh i have i have uh you know there are kids in the neighborhood and growing up stock and i talk to the kids too i there is a a girl that lives next door we talk a lot she just started at um everett the uh arts middle school 

Recording: (3264/ 9621) 
he admits now that he felt neglected of that period 

Recording: (3265/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i it is it it is it is tough i think it is i think it is tough and i think it is really an individual basis but i would not i would say that there is a lot of other things that are that would contribute more to any society problems and divorce i really do not think that that would be the main 

Recording: (3266/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (3267/ 9621)

Recording: (3281/ 9621) 
in most in most area in most school districts it is comparable to any other job now it used to always be low but like a beginning teacher in worthington starts i think twenty six eight or something course worthington is one of the three highest paid districts in ohio um but it used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or starting policeman and you know you in a sense you are out there risking your life everyday too

Recording: (3347/ 9621) 
he was tough but he was he was always tough and we did not realize it for years we did not have anything to compare to the only one kid we got uh he was very the psychologist told us that you know we were talking about things that happened and we was going to say you must have had a terrible time raising him because he was not an easy kid we did not know any different

you live and you learn 

Recording: (3361/ 9621) 
well that guy who could change for them that and in the movie they were about to kiss and i i do not like it when they get that close i i like the how their their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they are very good friends and they have that attention but they do not second come to it and i really like it i just dislike it a little less 

Recording: (3362/ 9621)

Recording: (3368/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (3369/ 9621) 
yeah um they were just really discussing how they behaved and a lot of yelling at students and that was really unnecessary uh they just totally approached it from the wrong point and i mean there were some students that actually were supporting them 

Recording: (3370/ 9621) 
yeah well and that is good for the baby too 

Recording: (3371/ 9621) 
maybe we will be on that we should not always be saying that 

Recording: (3372/ 9621)

Recording: (3376/ 9621) 
i think it is a good idea because i want my fair share of money a lot to give everybody a fair chance you know they do not just minimize it to one or two you know some of them have options and some of them do not 

Recording: (3377/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3378/ 9621) 
yeah right 

Recording: (3379/ 9621)

Recording: (3384/ 9621) 
wessling that is up in delaware and uh most of the time they had talked to you know i have not been there a while so i have not really talked to a whole population of students but the ones i did talk to even their you know professor and whatever they are majoring in we was out you know hanging out at the bar and it was doing karaoke on all man you should have something to hang on sleeping 

Recording: (3385/ 9621) 
i i was raised in the sunday school at the church up here yeah yeah so a long time member and in fact i think i may be about the longest term member of the choir right now yeah because i sang in the choir there when i was in high school back in nineteen seventy so it is thirty years ago yeah yeah it may be getting a little bit more common nowadays but it is still i think the church gets most of its members from as concertss and recovering right recovering you name it yeah 

Recording: (3386/ 9621) 
do is they eat out all the time we used to be restaurants i know it they are incredible 

Recording: (3387/ 9621)

it is pretty far 

Recording: (3389/ 9621) 
oh no 

Recording: (3390/ 9621) 
they it was it was all very progress you could tell you could really tell that they had an opinion about this um we talked about positives and negatives or braunfels things about um like in me and sit down at something that stuff i already knew 

Recording: (3391/ 9621)

Recording: (3395/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3396/ 9621) 
no no i think i am all right 

Recording: (3397/ 9621) 
big ball for it do they have like little babies that care in their patches like kingrews 

Recording: (3398/ 9621)

Recording: (3399/ 9621) 
right yeah and and and if my daughter does not seem to 

Recording: (3400/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (3401/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3402/ 9621) 
well i i 

Recording: (3403/ 9621) 
yeah you know and you know it is like uh i i honestly feel the older you get the more you kind of look at what is in there as opposed to you know gosh that is just uh four hundred dollar dress and a three hundred dollar hair do and you know what does that mean you know it is like uh when we are food for magazines my feeling is uh some people are going to say gee she had a really big house and so many people are going to go god she did work in this area for free and she volunteered to this and she did this and she did this and this and they are going to go oh you know it is like you know what what what do you want at the very end you know so 

Recording: (3404/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (3405/ 9621) 
because i mean that must be how she raises her kids you know and she is um and that is what i asked her she is got a husband i am like so your husband you believe in cheap yeah um i do not believe that i think that is terrible 

Recording: (3406/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3407/ 9621)

Recording: (3410/ 9621) 
so it is and it sometimes it will take a while to get your call what do you they we call your calling or your call but then you just it is exciting to find out where you are going to go 

Recording: (3411/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah yeah i would say anything outside would like doing that 

Recording: (3412/ 9621) 
and it was suspect uh she still ruled their favorite 

Recording: (3413/ 9621) 
just saying stepmother makes me go eat 

Recording: (3414/ 9621) 
oh yeah oh yeah we are crazy 

Recording: (3415/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3416/ 9621) 
the um i said i did not belong to any groups and that is not true i belong to ohio design or craftsman and um uh they in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio artists but the membership is is national so uh it is not it is not really closed it is just sort of focusing on ohio 

Recording: (3417/ 9621) 
i had a student bring me a paper today he said this is for history i have to write a essay on anthony wayne 

Recording: (3418/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3419/ 9621) 
we have to pay for that yeah oh yeah we oh yeah yeah we are paying for it 

Recording: (3420/ 9621) 
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right 

Recording: (3421/ 9621) 
that is a good system it was really fascinating too because i called microsoft and it was going to cost me thirty five dollars for technical support i look screw that i look screw that do and 

Recording: (3422/ 9621) 
there is a guinea pig type situation it is probably better in high school it is more college prep 

Recording: (3423/ 9621) 
because she enjoys cooking and makes it a little bit easier i tend to over cook the meat 

Recording: (3424/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3425/ 9621) 
and you know that their parents are not going to they are not going to say no the anyways 

Recording: (3426/ 9621) 
yeah i i think they are both boring if you look at the the image thing they are both fairly wooden neither one of them seems comfortable in front of a camera uh it is interesting on on bradley my boyfriend is is big in sports he is he is not as liberal as i am he is a little bit on the conservative side um and he but he would support bradley simply because he was a a a former uh basketball player and i am about ready to say to him at some point in time you know if he becomes president he is you are going to hate him because he has all these big government things and you are against big government um so i do not think people always always see that but uh between gore and bradley i do not see much difference quite frankly bradley is the more liberal um gore i think understands and need to compromise but i think gore will be the the candidate i think bradley will be able to go past all of the work that gore has been doing for eight years as vice president 

Recording: (3427/ 9621) 
well see i am limited on some of the stuff i like to do i like to well i like to go back into working with my hands and stuff i used to do maintenance uh there ai not nothing i can not fix

um-hum 

Recording: (3436/ 9621)

Recording: (3437/ 9621) 
that is i mean we would be seventy years old when the kid graduated from high school uh and that would not be fair to the kid and and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so we talked about it decided it was not a good idea 

Recording: (3438/ 9621) 
you would think by now you know this would not matter 

Recording: (3439/ 9621) 
dursban some of the things he has on there is some of the people i think they ought to arrest him for a glen sherman one tv

that is that is really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran negatives do not work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in columbus what plays in the state and then the people who ran her campaign ran boydivigas campaign and betty montgomery campaign and that negative stuff worked statewide that does not work so well in columbus um i i think it even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost um and i would like to think that age does not matter but she came across as old to me also and i like to think i am not prejudiced on on any issue but if there is uh someone who had been right on the issues i do not care she was old i would have voted for her she just did not support the issues i supported she was wrong on uh i i did not like that she tried to use um the police chief in such a negative way by saying that um colman had voted for a raise for the chief well yes he voted for a raise for a chief but he voted for a raise for the the police officers it is just that you know the police chief was tied to his and i do not like people who try to manipulate facts uh and and that was manipulating the fact i did not like that she was um uh uh against the the the tip uh in hilarious once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with but once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another device of issue just to get elected did not sit well with me um so i do not even if she had a lot of charisma that does not mean as much to me as a person is 

Recording: (3452/ 9621)

so 

Recording: (3485/ 9621) 
and actually in order to get in my room you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify high as a learning disability kid in other words the way you qualify in the state of ohio is you have a thirty point discrepancy between your actual iq and your daily performance in other words let us say you have a hundred iq but in all their classes you are performing like a seventy iq person would so if there is a thirty point discrimination in there and and people see that you are bright and but yet you are just not getting it you are not able to write answers like you could say or you are not able to read things that other seventh graders can read that kind of clues us in and then the regular ad or somebody prefers the child for testing and then if they qualify for help then we you know they go to my room for certain classes most of my kids i have them for reading in english 

Recording: (3486/ 9621) 
um-hum they had one i was just heard in the news this morning they were talking about some guys like seventy seven years old for kenyon college or something uh was doing a race because they were

Recording: (3491/ 9621) 
but that is what they go through 

Recording: (3492/ 9621) 
well i did not necessarily want to but that is where my family started me out they um are alternative to the public schools supposedly um just more i do not know exactly how to explain it the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything 

Recording: (3493/ 9621) 
um not to sound like a broken record but i really think it is our uh backslide on on family and it is i think it is too easy this day i and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately had that experience to me um that it is too easy to get divorced um people do not really go into marriage with commitment in lifetime and have that i do not want to say old fashioned value but just the value of this is very important um because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want to smack him and he is being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and then behind a hour later week later whatever long it takes i am in love with them again i mean really you know what i am saying and um i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of just children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring them up in a more stable environment um unfortunately i think that is the problem parents um are a either get divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start putting the kids against each other you know using the kid as a medium um or their two selfish do not listen to their kids or they did not um i do not want to say selfish but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and um not spending enough time with the kids you know they are working whatnot and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that um and i do not think enough families are doing that 

Recording: (3494/ 9621) 
no i do not work for politics 

Recording: (3495/ 9621) 
so i gave myself a long weekend yeah it is i wish i would wish i would been last weekend it was real nice last weekend so i gave gave myself a long weekend and just catch up i sleep a little bit around my daughter is getting ready to go to italy so that is 

Recording: (3496/ 9621) 
to help calm them down 

Recording: (3497/ 9621) 
um they try to limit the the 

Recording: (3498/ 9621) 
money is not everything it is too bad sports have ended up this way 

Recording: (3499/ 9621) 
or on your hard drive um because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft or i will say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over have somebody else proof read it because you are not going to see the mistakes because you are too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say and you are not going to notice them spelled t h i m or they t h a y yeah or a sentence that is too long or a sentence that is a frag and it is not a complete thought you are not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you oh well i had a 

Recording: (3500/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i guess so i mean there are people spending seventy percent hours on computers doing this type of thing just going out there and seeing what they can find 

Recording: (3501/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (3502/ 9621)

Recording: (3509/ 9621) 
and we now run of the grigorian and uh that sort of thing but back to your question i think you were asking are 

Recording: (3510/ 9621) 
well in the lower grades i believe that they are because i think they should have some male role models 

Recording: (3511/ 9621) 
oh my that is goes with the disorder they know they know when who is button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and you know where the line is and they push uh always that is why teachers they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 

Recording: (3512/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3513/ 9621) 
you know hooking up real tight with guys but he really likes these guys 

Recording: (3514/ 9621) 
but you know you need to get it out of off your chest 

Recording: (3515/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (3516/ 9621) 
a computer calls you 

Recording: (3517/ 9621) 
yeah well that is easy 

Recording: (3518/ 9621) 
you know not that i am talking negative about my mother that she has uh some uh near logical damage 

Recording: (3519/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3520/ 9621) 
well they do not really give it to them that is the thing is uh i have got i have got some friends that with kids and i see it like on the bus or with uh you know when you are working somewhere or not where you people treat their kids you know as uh 

Recording: (3521/ 9621) 
and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music on as i do and i says please i may listen to my head phones but then they can not hear you when you say okay the time is up to stop now or whatever you are going uh and uh poke him so i do not usually let the kids listen to their head phones so maybe the last week of school in june or something but or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i do not because they get too out of touch with everything that is going on and around and i do not have a like a regular size class like i do not have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven high school 

Recording: (3522/ 9621) 
yeah it was because i got it was because i got into a different i mean i had grown up with these people you know i hung out with all these people that were part of my youth group and and i hung out with them and hung out with them and and i came to columbus and met a whole new group of people i mean every year i have been down here i have met another you know thousand people and they are all different every year they are all different people and i did not have to back home i keep meeting people and it is just really fascinating yeah and it is this endless flow of people you know like wow and man there gets some new looking people down here and that is some good looking checks down here in columbus let me tell you uh yeah my freshman year i went out with uh someone her name was she um she is the one that really got me into the uh what we call charismatic um christianity the christianity uh you know like the opposite of charismatic is the uh the serious old time protest in church where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up your himnesty those numbers you sing you stand up whenever he tells you stand up you sit down when everyone tells you sit down you ought to be ought to and then the protestant the uh sorry the um charismatic because the exact opposite of that when you think of charismatic you think of the black churches where there is all sorts of work and plan and you know please the lord and hands in the air and singing and dancing and people falling over and and she is she really introduced me to that um and then we dated for about three months and i both of us decided okay this is we accomplished what we we are supposed to accomplish in this relationship you have introduced me to something and i have introduced you to something and now we are going to go our separate ways and so we separated and then i found my current church and got plugged in there and i met someone there um ineighted for two months and then i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said oh will not you wear the person i am going to marry and that 

Recording: (3523/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3524/ 9621) 
in his own mind regardless it is part of that bad spirit that people have created the devil not satan to the native people he does not exist and to me he does not exist he is it is shit but he is real 

Recording: (3525/ 9621) 
and she would not have learned that a whole day kindergarten here 

Recording: (3526/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3527/ 9621) 
either they are so paranoid you know what i mean they are more worried about stopping 

Recording: (3528/ 9621) 
we wanted it to keep on going so they just did not need to do like that and then i think once they noticed that the uh comics were going to open without them they realized that the university is functioning or was functioning fine without them 

Recording: (3529/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (3530/ 9621) 
more like that right 

Recording: (3531/ 9621) 
reality strikes 

Recording: (3532/ 9621) 
what it is called high school 

Recording: (3533/ 9621) 
it it makes me wonder because um i do not i do not see a lot of movies so a lot of this is you know just from reading reviews and stuff but it seems like you know last last year two explosives would do the job this year you got to have five explosives and two car chases and and mutilated bodies you know it it just seems like it it you need more and more sensationalism to sell your to sell your product and uh it is it is really hard to do to to talk about morals um without bringing uh you know religious background or something into it i think i think uh the way the schools should approach it is that if you get pregnant it is going to ruin your life so you do not want to do that do you you know that sort of thing 

Recording: (3534/ 9621) 
so i mean it is something i am i am comfortable with 

Recording: (3535/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (3536/ 9621) 
now what is what kind of impression is her kids getting 

Recording: (3537/ 9621) 
the uh technical systems and policy end of it and hated it the other years were fine but those last three were pretty bad uh 

Recording: (3538/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3539/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3540/ 9621) 
oh is that francisco did you spend much time with you just passing to to the airport in san francisco 

Recording: (3541/ 9621)

Recording: (3547/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3548/ 9621) 
well we were in north africa first for the north african campaign when romeo was still rooming and then when uh that ended up in the summer of puller nineteen forty two i believe and uh then we were sent to italy i used the field of artillerie outfits uh six inch guns 

Recording: (3549/ 9621) 
yeah i have heard that too it is different and it is you know i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worst you know and i then you can talk to some other people that are oh you have not seen anything yet wait till they just do not even want to be in sight with you and do not wait till they and i am not going on vacation with you i could not spend a week there with you so you know hope that does not happen but i have heard friends say you know they are thirteen year olds just rolled over from one to the other you know from the best kid in town to you know i am running away i am never going to school again so it is tough any wonder what causes that yeah yeah is it the you know where where would you go wrong you know somebody needs to figure it out that is it that is what i worry about the large school systems too that is what is concerns me with hillard you get such a large variety of people compared to like where i was in the smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it is your parents knew their yeah your parents knew their parents their parents they you know now you know and i walk to my friend is house and have her friends and if she is going over to play they got to drive them almost because they are they are all around so it is not the neighborhood thing as much and you can not let them run around as much as we did we you know we rode our bikes every way we rode to the pool we rode down to the store and now you are scared to let them ride around anywhere because you are afraid they are not going to come back you know i enjoyed a lot oh yeah i watched the first open heart transplant i also saw first lever transplant 

Recording: (3550/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3551/ 9621) 
i am kind of happy i am not doing that anymore it really takes a certain type of person to work for and that is hard to find in that area so 

Recording: (3552/ 9621) 
just my wife and i this time 

Recording: (3553/ 9621) 
uh just how like to how there is no real like everybody conforms to their own set of norms in each group you know it is like people no matter like you know even if ted k in ski is out like on on you know wherever and like his little shed and he is still apart in society like how you can not get away from society and just how like how society develops in general like how high school is like is is kind of true to life but then really different too on how life is but just how it is just a more of a like more of a closeness thing so it is more apparent how how segregation works or whatever 

Recording: (3554/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3555/ 9621) 
cool 

Recording: (3556/ 9621) 
uh-huh well my twenty nine year old she is married and uh she has a child and she is she is expecting another one and she is a senior here at um oh i she will be graduating in june and uh she is worked you know really hard and my son he is uh he is a senior he is twenty two he is a senior here uh i do not think he is going to graduate in two thousand because he is a new senior he wants to go to law school well he does a real law at school he is uh like an honor honor honor everything you know but that is all uh you know on him he did it you know 

Recording: (3557/ 9621) 
so that to me is very i mean that is ridiculous like the governor he could have made a stay or you know what i mean and they have openly admitted that they have killed people that were found to be innocent later 

Recording: (3558/ 9621) 
so um i do not know 

Recording: (3559/ 9621) 
and the state of ohio is definition of gifted child is anyone who scores seventy percent or higher on some test that they give well you know they have saying half the students in columbus schools were gifted students so that is not it is impossible gifted students there is fourteen different characteristics to look at you can not just look at one thing 

Recording: (3560/ 9621) 
you well in some ways it is i guess it is necessary but it is just you reminisce about the way it used to look and and um i was just at a place last night i was at this a public comment meeting for the little darby national wildlife refuse that they are planning for madison county and uh there were some there was some talk about that and it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuse and there were people that were opposed to the wilder refuse mostly people that lived there near there farmers and but it seems like the one thing that almost everybody there agreed on was they did not want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments and uh that we somebody was talking there about the difference between development here in the united states and in europe um and how development in in europe tends to take note of the fact that space is not limitless so you will have more uh more people living in one house or one apartment building uh and they will go up rather than across just to take up space and you know they they are conscientious about preserving space and preserving wild space 

Recording: (3561/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3562/ 9621)

Recording: (3597/ 9621) 
two for country one for state or 

Recording: (3598/ 9621) 
right we are kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way does not mean it is the right way and um yeah i you know i really struggle with that because i i come more from i think the families should teach it but let us be realistic how many families are going to do that or have the mentality to do that it seems like um sounds like my dad these days these days most of the people a lot of people that are having kids should not be 

Recording: (3599/ 9621) 
for two bucks you know you can not beat that 

Recording: (3600/ 9621)

Recording: (3611/ 9621) 
to the other side 

Recording: (3612/ 9621)

Recording: (3622/ 9621) 
yeah you just set the computer and key the data in or well the system we are doing now is you can put in like uh the address to irl for a web resource that goes out and extracts state analyze what is there and comes up up with you know subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you and then you can edit it and do whatever you want with it so you know it is it is doing some of that some of that the automatic is finding of subject savings and call numbers that is a lot of we are doing a lot of research on that it is got a ways to go it is getting better 

Recording: (3623/ 9621) 
um i do not think that really matters honestly um i mean it is i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you are usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by that time those kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like and do not like um i can not see i can not see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone is they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going to have to do it too or whatever 

Recording: (3624/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (3625/ 9621)

dead the protection 

Recording: (3632/ 9621)

Recording: (3633/ 9621) 
or you know the things that we learned when we were kids because our mom not stay home and read them and all that fairy tale stuff and nursery rhime stuff they do not have a clue what you are talking about 

Recording: (3634/ 9621)

Recording: (3637/ 9621) 
where 

Recording: (3638/ 9621) 
i am not sure uh i am not sure that the the federal government has the ability to convince enough people to do it and i do not think it is i think the people that are going to be ready to accept it and go with it are i do not think they are going to get a good cross section of the population i think the people will be willing to understand it and go with it more they are gonna be the more educated and this sort of thing than you are leaving out a large part of the population so i am not sure it is gonna give valid results anyway 

Recording: (3639/ 9621) 
yeah yeah exactly i was without there was like yeah that is how we talked but until then you are like okay this is ridiculous 

Recording: (3640/ 9621)

Recording: (3683/ 9621) 
from our friends that have gone yeah what is their discipline is expiling child from school well they are expiling them to a home where the parent is working where they are just getting three days a free play i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble they really are not learning from that

stagged backbeats and stuff and like if i can play bass and like i i have like like a processor thing and stuff that i fool around i was just doing stuff like that and some of my friends like play on drum machines and stuff like that so i just do stuff like that more like it it is not it is not like you are playing like you are not spending records it is like it can 

Recording: (3685/ 9621) 
it is like each neighborhood is got a little different personality

Recording: (3689/ 9621)

i did have a job like that when i worked full time 

Recording: (3692/ 9621)

Recording: (3693/ 9621) 
because it is hard for us to deal with 

Recording: (3694/ 9621) 
yeah um and i can say there are some drugs that i do not really consider to be too threatening or that i am really too worried about people using um like i mean just the whole idea of with marijuana and things like that i mean it does not really bother me so much i mean cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does 

Recording: (3695/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (3696/ 9621)

Recording: (3700/ 9621) 
i told him that he gets no guarantee that i will come back and in exchange i do not get health coverage while i am gone that is not quite a coincidence with him again i am talking about 

Recording: (3701/ 9621) 
and so i think i will probably end up changing i do not know what to it would probably be even more towards the education line 

Recording: (3702/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3703/ 9621) 
one of the whether it is a written goal or not that is what they are doing

Recording: (3715/ 9621) 
i do not know it is like that that is that is like you know that is i guess that is one way to you know to to get you into the into you know into the business field i do not know i do not know how do you prepare yourself with teaching in front of a large audience that is like something you would have to like you know i would have to anyways use myself into 

Recording: (3716/ 9621) 
i do not know just exactly where the others are but they are here in the clumber area 

Recording: (3717/ 9621)

Recording: (3746/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3747/ 9621) 
exactly that is the that is the idea that people get they do not i do not think they realize that how much work it is 

Recording: (3748/ 9621) 
green bay packers 

Recording: (3749/ 9621) 
how am i going to tell who is you know trying to butter me up by raising their hand and and asking questions um 

Recording: (3750/ 9621) 
perfect example you know or your computer can not tell you that you spelled o n e when you meant to spell w o n 

Recording: (3751/ 9621) 
right that is true 

Recording: (3752/ 9621) 
it is just like there is a lot of different uh like influences and everything and like there is just a lot of places you can go with it so it is real good 

Recording: (3753/ 9621) 
that and i heard i kind of liked the change they are talking about they are talking about putting underground power lines and taking the pulls out 

Recording: (3754/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3755/ 9621) 
yeah i so that is what i want to do just yeah 

Recording: (3756/ 9621) 
yeah i mean maybe breakins are down we are holding them seven elevens are down but then you hear these you know murders 

Recording: (3757/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3758/ 9621) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (3759/ 9621) 
as back into into high school 

Recording: (3760/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3761/ 9621) 
uh well uh uh westernville yeah so that is difficult for us to deal with 

Recording: (3762/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3763/ 9621) 
that is where we are in our evolution 

Recording: (3764/ 9621) 
well definitely it just happened to me when i was in the third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh uh went home after school and you were playing with a gun and everything and and uh one of them got shot and killed the other one you know accidentally uh it just goes to you know my dad always had a gun and he did not have it locked up all the time but you know it was not necessarily in the same place all the time either you know i mean so if you were not really looking forward i mean you know you would have to happen stand just stand us on to it or something you know uh uh i believe nowadays you know that perhaps with the uh with the the guns you know the bail billy the and more people having guns that do not know do not should not have them apparently uh you know they should be uh under lock and key uh you know is for the you know the parents somebody is responsible for it you know but see then you get into catch twenty two because of the legislation and i mean you can not require i do not see how you can require a a a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that in case of a burglar comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you should not have one unless you are a sportsman and uh then you know you are it is not got to be worth it to have the gun in the first place so 

Recording: (3765/ 9621) 
so i pretty much um it is not stressfulful at all i i it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (3766/ 9621) 
yeah he is yeah he is twenty six 

Recording: (3767/ 9621) 
probably it is you are right i i asked him what language did he have to learn to 

Recording: (3768/ 9621) 
um i am a great employer and i i got hired in one of the oakland lines and they interview conversation with high end and in this particular month i am going to europe but i may or may not come back you want to continue talking he said sure let us keep talking he said okay let me continue talking so um it is up in the air 

Recording: (3769/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3770/ 9621) 
and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back and that was one of the better schools in columbus and you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um uh principals driving big fabulous cars and 

Recording: (3771/ 9621) 
my dad had to be time to beat in cincinnati which they probably should have killed and then who you that it was like beating it you know 

Recording: (3772/ 9621) 
and it is really unfortunate for the the workers in there because and the people at mary lake are so great 

Recording: (3773/ 9621) 
i teach a class on thursday nights um how to play with computers i uh play games on tuesday nights 

Recording: (3774/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (3775/ 9621) 
yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good 

Recording: (3776/ 9621) 
oh yes i did book 

Recording: (3777/ 9621) 
and um i do not know i think having just having the word on there gives it some kids enough prestige that they do not totally freak out about not going ivy league 

Recording: (3778/ 9621) 
boy i do not know i am thinking you know the the divorce people i know have had children and involved and um boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step it is already you know they have already been to counseling they have already tried a lot of other things and that they are i do not know whether some kind of court ordered thinking about it heavy thinking would uh 

Recording: (3779/ 9621) 
that is true books reading well i think it is a normal reading books and stuff but you know you are sitting there or you are like reading a magazine did you know what this guy did you know look down at him did you see what this guy did 

Recording: (3780/ 9621) 
and it is really sort of interesting 

Recording: (3781/ 9621) 
yeah well yeah and but you know i mean that that is that is civilization wide 

Recording: (3782/ 9621) 
oh well 

Recording: (3783/ 9621) 
and uh eventually he he was all right with it he got used to it 

Recording: (3784/ 9621) 
a lot of them they do not want any better they will not want anything different that is all they want 

Recording: (3785/ 9621) 
but uh you know i knew that uh they had already made that promise and there is a lot of businesses that could move out of that area you know and half those taxes come to columbus even if a business is in west orville half the the employees tax are going to um west orville and half are coming to columbus 

Recording: (3786/ 9621) 
gun box where he is a pick he can break in anything uh but when i was a kid too we used to go out to turkey shoots and i would go hunting all the time so i was pretty familiar with guns my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns but he also knew not to touch them 

Recording: (3787/ 9621) 
yeah i do not well we just sort of started making a big flash in australia in about the last three years so they may not they may have 

Recording: (3788/ 9621) 
i am trying to work on my license for sky diving though uh-huh 

Recording: (3789/ 9621) 
that you would need uh like in the old days you know to melt metal they used uh air pumping it through 

Recording: (3790/ 9621) 
not not yet not i mean he will he will pull himself up on table top and he will like turn around like hey 

Recording: (3791/ 9621) 
yeah i i hope to uh at forty nine you know i i have learned a heck of a lot uh a lot of things i would not want to know you know but i think it i think uh they have been a good as long as they he turned them around and and make them a positive statement for you but that is why i would like to have uh uh uh a book store just like down around campus you know and people can come in and go over there and relax you know and um 

Recording: (3792/ 9621) 
well uh when i came uh back from oregon my father was very ill and so i did not want fulltime work and i started substituting out in uh looking uh and which paid terribly low there is all these little districts that have uh super intended well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a super intended which they do not need you know so they they are hard straight out of college choice and there there is a law that you uh you have to pay for your accumulated time so i could not get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me for so i came it back into columbus and it is a lot harder to work in columbus public but but uh i i know the territory i know where i am going 

Recording: (3793/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (3794/ 9621) 
well basically it is the same thing here but some of your management is real good i have seen people that that you know are super but i have seen people that are bad the problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell i do not care who you are 

Recording: (3795/ 9621) 
um so he is he is learning about the computer now it is gonna be kind of a hobby at least it is not a work thing but i know we can do a lot of things for a house 

Recording: (3796/ 9621) 
even i hate hearing myself on tape too 

Recording: (3797/ 9621) 
i you know maybe i am oblivious to things but i mean i mean it seems like there is a lot of worse places 

Recording: (3798/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know if i could trust them you know 

Recording: (3799/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3800/ 9621) 
uh oh okay well you know the shot is 

Recording: (3801/ 9621) 
okay yeah i am in a uh in the guinea peck class of this program through medical school where after three years of undergraduate i go to med school here like without m cats or anything 

Recording: (3802/ 9621) 
if you see that thing you can be ducking them you know seventy seven years old i can not imagine being hurt by them you know 

Recording: (3803/ 9621) 
yeah you can not say a known is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than math and science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at any of them once in a while you will see a good spell or because he can remember the order and which letters come but he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell yeah and his comprehension of the words of other kids his age would not be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 

Recording: (3804/ 9621) 
uhhuhhas culture has that situation they have a white cat then and they are often so black they are the you know if they are well into the house they are black and culture are whiteit is 

Recording: (3805/ 9621) 
well i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i started taking classes about you know kids with eighty eighty and stuff and little by little for you know i had my master is in learning disabilities and it was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out there were so many openings and special ed so and then i found out later that speech therapy has a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficit and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper or they do not process things correctly auditorily so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (3806/ 9621) 
sure well that and they like tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and i i was reading a book and i let her out and i let her back in and started reading again and i looking our house and here is mud so it is kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know uh you live here it is not that big of a deal you know because i know my sister would freak i am 

Recording: (3807/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3808/ 9621) 
well the it was just communication was not there 

Recording: (3809/ 9621) 
well i think it is more capable of being violent because of the uh information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or before you know somebody got mad at somebody you know you might they might shoot them or something but not kill a hundred innocent people for no reason 

Recording: (3810/ 9621) 
how about 

Recording: (3811/ 9621) 
yeah you know like you know that that that it typical american tourists 

Recording: (3812/ 9621) 
yeah i i love that show i have nearly every episode on tape but this past this past season i have i have been really disappointed with the simpsons 

Recording: (3813/ 9621) 
which is not fun and number two you know the diseases and things like that i think that is a good idea to teach just that it is not all uh fun and peer pressure and stuff i know kind of got off track there but 

Recording: (3814/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (3815/ 9621) 
yeah i i do not think he spends time with him like that you know he sees them at his mom is house and he you know will come by and see them at my house but i try to um put a i do not know because we seem to argue a lot you know and i do not like to do it for my kids to see that so i try i try to do the best thing for my son 

Recording: (3816/ 9621) 
yeah it is it is uh um probably about four years left i am almost done with all my gcs and everything like that so that is about done 

Recording: (3817/ 9621)

Recording: (3829/ 9621) 
to make money on the side all through the government uh that is why i mean it is to easy to get away with stuff nowadays 

Recording: (3830/ 9621) 
i think they should too i do i really do i mean and then it is and you are right that is not fair because then that is that is a way to 

Recording: (3831/ 9621) 
um i do not know do you know anything about unix 

Recording: (3832/ 9621) 
you could call the operations over there and say you know as we are playing on the ground

Recording: (3841/ 9621) 
her her little boyfriend who was the the captain kirk commander ryan or like stud persona i see in many ways uh i mean i agree in deep space uh big deep and it is like i do not dislike voyager i just do not like it to the same degree um in deep space nine they had major to uh who was a soldier and a revolutionary and i i thought in many ways she like completely broke out of traditional gender roles i also like deep space nine in that uh they address the issue of different people living and working together different people of different i mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denomination of humans but it it approached that from a less uh from a more realistic standpoint instead of having like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we come to people who do not get along and we look at the problem it was centered on that uh i i am getting off topic i wanted to go back to to voyager what you were saying with the the the uh generals i i liked at first having uh talked in jane wayne being a female in the leadership standpoint but i i still think that uh the the women on the show particularly seven of nine uh are are used as sex subjects uh for the for the viewers 

Recording: (3842/ 9621) 
oh where they they were already in the garage do they not buy them themselves 

Recording: (3843/ 9621)

Recording: (3861/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (3862/ 9621) 
a little bit 

Recording: (3863/ 9621) 
fire hazard 

Recording: (3864/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (3886/ 9621)

Recording: (3897/ 9621) 
fatherly instinct 

Recording: (3898/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3899/ 9621) 
objectives because uh when we went into the service and then went overseas our objective was to do away with the lord of miss lenny and uh he was in d that he he was not in a kind of an approar in a rifle in a rifle company or something like that that was rough 

Recording: (3900/ 9621) 
uh just travel to australia maybe yeah so that is the well if you might you know like you know like you hear like in these stories you ever go to europe if you do if they you ever do the the backpacking bit 

Recording: (3901/ 9621) 
or to do anything extreme to their bodies 

Recording: (3902/ 9621) 
or maybe it is well 

Recording: (3903/ 9621) 
and stuff uh because i used to go from henderson down to lane avenue and i would hit one light on one chance you know that was it 

Recording: (3904/ 9621) 
really bad like the prices in the stores are like way outrageous to me 

Recording: (3905/ 9621) 
let me focus on your question i am not sure that i that she was answering what i thought you but i am 

Recording: (3906/ 9621) 
oh um i thought about being a medical scientist with some dphd and they do um research like um with applications to medicine but more in the biochlor field or genetic or something like that 

Recording: (3907/ 9621)

and most kids do not do that nowadays 

Recording: (3910/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3911/ 9621) 
so they knew that this bush name would bring out a lot of money which it has he is got a lot of money to work with and you know that does not seem fair either i do not think you know the average person in the united states the average person uh does not think that your politician should be bought you know 

Recording: (3912/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3913/ 9621) 
not like i am 

Recording: (3914/ 9621)

Recording: (3932/ 9621) 
basically because you know the open shelter i do not know whether you have ever been around there but it is not a pretty site you know 

Recording: (3933/ 9621) 
that is all right 

Recording: (3934/ 9621) 
she does not know that i do not go to church 

Recording: (3935/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is not i mean it was a really long time ago everything is fine but i guess for me i just it it i do not know it is just a little more a little more than i wanted to see but the classes i think were helpful but um what would you ask me 

Recording: (3936/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (3937/ 9621) 
oh yeah i have been doing i have been there twenty over twenty years so yeah i am enjoying it it is always changing 

Recording: (3938/ 9621) 
see i live close to 

Recording: (3939/ 9621) 
oh i am i am sure the fact that my parents um my mother tried to real try it is really hard but my my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted you know he he could drink on the weekends and never miss work et cetera yeah there was no problem and uh um but the biggest problem is the fact that you know i um i i i have always expected to have some sort of a respect from them and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and same for myself and so i mean exactly what they always said they wanted it is just that they can not handle that and so when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot in in a lot of trouble about um the whole racial thing because uh i am from a school where i was mostly white students were 

Recording: (3940/ 9621) 
but you can make them aware of somebody as an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable you know there should be some kind of a a system to where these girls the slightest bit you know it is anonymous it is you know 

Recording: (3941/ 9621) 
yeah my brother did not know what to heck to do with a checkbook 

Recording: (3942/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3943/ 9621) 
uh we actually were from plymouth and we moved down to africa and uh they moved back up to everyone i was in sixty nine seventy two so uh then i was in two years reserves uh uh basically uh electronic not not an engineer but electronic assembly and stuff like that uh missile systems you know is what it was called but mcdonald got these big names for things um-hum 

Recording: (3944/ 9621) 
to tell you the score went too such i mean 

Recording: (3945/ 9621) 
would be would be interested in i mean i mean not just for the kids sake but would be interested on their own rehab in in teaching the child what uh 

Recording: (3946/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (3947/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (3948/ 9621) 
she was but i admire her more because um until the modern to get control of the republican party again that is going to be the litmus test it is just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of a democratic party they would nomination such people as uh mcdonald who had not you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line left a center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it is easier to get that sold to the american public um so uh while i think dole was correct um i think she uh she shot herself on the foot i do not she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controlled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they move they need to move towards the middle which i think george w is trying to do um uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell them i tell them yes and i am an uh an indifferent liberal 

Recording: (3949/ 9621) 
and they have met the couple that is going to adopt the baby which seems kind of odd to me but 

Recording: (3950/ 9621) 
has not for about four years he refuses to refuses to live with us because we have rules 

Recording: (3951/ 9621) 
i keep thinking about that all the time but i am like i want something where i can be off during the summer so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know because my wife is in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young i have a five year old and i only have six years to go so we are talking eleven years old 

Recording: (3952/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (3953/ 9621) 
it is a lot bigger 

Recording: (3954/ 9621) 
i i have heard it it has not been as i have heard it from less reputable sources 

Recording: (3955/ 9621) 
okay i am thinking people who who backbook a pretty cool you know 

Recording: (3956/ 9621) 
i do not think forcing prayer on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (3957/ 9621) 
no because they are going to learn that on their own um i i personally think that is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are homosexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and blah blah blah because but i have also known people that were that way and now are homosexual and are much happier and they realized that it was just the choice they made and things like that um so it is in today is day and age they are going to learn about it quickly 

Recording: (3958/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3959/ 9621) 
uh-huh but uh that is a bunch of that is just one of those myths i think that is to make people feel guilty or something 

Recording: (3960/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3961/ 9621) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtown i mean you you know it seems like you just drive through in the two minutes and you are out so i do not think that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so 

Recording: (3962/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3963/ 9621) 
biological experience 

Recording: (3964/ 9621) 
yeah yeah the no no desire yeah 

Recording: (3965/ 9621) 
i was in columbus for the first like six years i taught 

Recording: (3966/ 9621) 
oh oh wow oh see and she is probably really good 

Recording: (3967/ 9621) 
sunday 

Recording: (3968/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3969/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (3970/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3971/ 9621) 
now we used to do uh fifty cents you know a game you know just to win back the quarters and plop them in you know not too much gambling on that part yeah 

Recording: (3972/ 9621) 
it is it was very much high school 

Recording: (3973/ 9621) 
but right now with his attitude the way it is i would say that me and my family are better off not having him stir up a bunch of conflict or whatever 

Recording: (3974/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3975/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3976/ 9621) 
that go on 

Recording: (3977/ 9621) 
uh so there is always something going wrong with the wearing or the plumbing or the something and uh it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house that older house but not anymore 

Recording: (3978/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3979/ 9621) 
they never saw it they never said anything about it 

Recording: (3980/ 9621) 
i do not know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it is just necessary 

Recording: (3981/ 9621) 
they 

Recording: (3982/ 9621) 
it is supposed to be a uh let me see school for art 

Recording: (3983/ 9621) 
i want you to be a man you know play basketball 

Recording: (3984/ 9621) 
oh i wish yeah i do it during summer too i usually work down here 

Recording: (3985/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (3986/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (3987/ 9621) 
a whole lot 

Recording: (3988/ 9621) 
because i guess it all came together because i do not understand how people can let their kids be hurt but 

Recording: (3989/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3990/ 9621) 
what they should do is just tell people that their kids do not get to go to school i bet the attitude change is pretty fast 

Recording: (3991/ 9621) 
i do not know if there is any particular i think if someone knows if anyone knew of something like that going on they would 

Recording: (3992/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3993/ 9621) 
and i think i think if we could you know if if we could just keep that going into into middle school 

Recording: (3994/ 9621) 
yeah i could skip any program i wanted to you know just show up at the parties basically 

Recording: (3995/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (3996/ 9621) 
she wears high heels why would she wear high heels 

Recording: (3997/ 9621) 
uh mom and sister who moved out to california 

Recording: (3998/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (3999/ 9621) 
to milk cartel was 

Recording: (4000/ 9621) 
cooking though 

Recording: (4001/ 9621) 
come on you know people i do not know i would hate to be in a predicament of having to change anything because it would be hard to change one group and not another 

Recording: (4002/ 9621) 
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and 

Recording: (4003/ 9621) 
yeah it can be a problem if you get hit 

Recording: (4004/ 9621) 
oh i think i think that the society in a general is declining in a lot of ways our morals are decline and our uh intelligence level maybe not level i mean i suppose is still high but people are settling for less i have a big sign in my room that says never settle for less than you are very best because i really think people are getting lazy even adults we you know we do not even want to wait twenty five seconds for microwave popcorn we do not you know we are getting impatient 

Recording: (4005/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4006/ 9621) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (4007/ 9621) 
probably um northwest area 

Recording: (4008/ 9621) 
oh really uh it is like whoa milk and swisslers 

Recording: (4009/ 9621) 
some of them did and some of them were just complete idiots but you find that anywhere 

Recording: (4010/ 9621) 
the town okay 

Recording: (4011/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4012/ 9621) 
yeah huh 

Recording: (4013/ 9621) 
uh the the accent sometimes but uh they they are okay i mean no no big problem but uh the the accent sometimes it is like um i sort of a a running joke i do not know if i should say this but it is like if i can talk like these and uh talk all the time like this why is it that they can not talk like we do you know it is like you know if i can if i could talk that way because we do have pilots that you talk like 

Recording: (4014/ 9621) 
like let us go come on well yeah because i had lots ofep and stuff because they introduced me because my doctor said hey it is time we can do this so i got it lucky even though i kind of wanted it to have it you know normal 

Recording: (4015/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (4016/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4017/ 9621) 
issues so um you know that is one thing that that i hope that they they work on 

Recording: (4018/ 9621) 
well it would have been something that they would have supported and something that i would have probably been pretty good at 

Recording: (4019/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4020/ 9621) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much raised as i mean it is whereas if you are my supervisor i am just using this example and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4021/ 9621) 
she read my notes and all that 

Recording: (4022/ 9621) 
so i made a last step and you know you look back and you see things you are really this is real obvious but at the time i think you i was like um hey i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and you know that type of thing 

Recording: (4023/ 9621) 
and then you come here you know and i mean you see people stand out on the street corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (4024/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think it is possible it have to take the right combination of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed i mean i some of her issues i do not like but when she came out uh and said her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns uh she went up and couple of notches in in my estimation because i was not sure where she would be i thought she would have to sell herself this hard line with a hard line republican and then i would have been able to vote for 

Recording: (4025/ 9621) 
and and she is very determined uh she had said that having this being pregnant and having this baby is made her focus on things a lot differently she does she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (4026/ 9621) 
great guy but he is sure like to get drunk you know and the problem is he would turn into such a jerk 

Recording: (4027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4028/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4029/ 9621) 
um-hum right right 

Recording: (4030/ 9621) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good day care because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before you know it was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or seventh in a church when it first started but and uh it is just not you know people are always saying i can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to somebody is neighbor is house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and 

Recording: (4031/ 9621) 
than than they were raised and they are but i told her i you know there is i will never be married if my man is going to be cheap no me i will not marry him 

Recording: (4032/ 9621) 
right and he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends and we still see them a whole lot and we were close with their parents and 

Recording: (4033/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4034/ 9621) 
oh i see well that would be a good way i would think 

Recording: (4035/ 9621) 
whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bathroom and three fifteen or things like that 

Recording: (4036/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4037/ 9621) 
get it from us so 

Recording: (4038/ 9621) 
i defending my stepmother against the rest of my family immediately following my father is death because there was uh some bitters between the rest of my family and my stepmother so my sister and i defending my stepmother against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shifted us and so stepmother is evil 

Recording: (4039/ 9621) 
right and then they wonder why uh you know uh i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way they will go the real thing do you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (4040/ 9621) 
play lottery once in a while if i have a couple bucks on me and uh well football games we will not even start with that 

Recording: (4041/ 9621)

make a lot of salads 

Recording: (4043/ 9621) 
look at her she is so terrific i could not watch her go 

Recording: (4044/ 9621)

Recording: (4045/ 9621) 
really yeah i do not feel old at all i mean i you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you want to do or you know and and i guess there is different phases like uh mazda is iraqi what is that the uh the higherucky of needs mazda anyway 

Recording: (4046/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4047/ 9621)

Recording: (4056/ 9621)

i do not know i uh the kids or uh they are like something in there up and bringing and i do not know what it is uh thank goodness none of my kids ever took that sort of attitude and uh i would like to i would like to think that my wife and i set them a good example my wife was a uh very conscientious hard working woman she established a secretarial business there at our a home for several years and uh anything that went out of there was right i mean and uh she did well quite a lot of camping for students over here graduate students

most of them at our site now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect others people connect us and then go out and it is a gateway to other places yeah we are getting more to that now but that was not easy so easy before either the you know the way we got 

Recording: (4080/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (4081/ 9621) 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know what i mean basically all all i have ever seen is all i these kids are getting a house they go to a house they find a gun and they want to hold the parents responsible yes and no on that if the parents had the gun in the house they had to uh ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car what if the kid brought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun

Recording: (4094/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4095/ 9621) 
that would be fine but again i do not it is just another person with a different life style like they are they are they are the same as me he is just 

Recording: (4096/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4097/ 9621) 
no i just uh basically got out of a uh a relationship it was like a rebound type thing um i was in a relationship for like three years and um he was cheating on me and so i felt really bad why did you pick her and then i met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful 

Recording: (4098/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4099/ 9621) 
uh and we are the fourth 

Recording: (4100/ 9621) 
they have on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they sell it and move on 

Recording: (4101/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4102/ 9621) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a psychology undergraduate so yeah 

Recording: (4103/ 9621) 
because like i think it is archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in in in columbus and to me no matter how bad of an area you live in and about a bad a school you think you are going to if you want to do it you can because and really and come from public schools if you have a learning disability or you know if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you and and in uh like worthington and westernville double and you know they do not have the money to throw away like catholic schools they do not have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get pushed aside and so you know as you can see i am standing in my soapbox here i do like plymouth schools but you know i i i hate when people say you know look at these test scores because it really does not reflect to what is there because it is like saying all kids carry guns in school they do not you know and the media says well what is there been like maybe five or six people who have taken guns to school and killed people what about the uh millions and millions of kids that go to school every day do their homework and you know do community service and stuff well well that is just too boring they do not want to hear that stuff you know it is like that that irritates me 

Recording: (4104/ 9621) 
yeah we did a lot of searching when we bought our house you know it is hard to find what you want in the house and get the school system too you get into arlington you get into grandview places like this or actually and the price range we were in you were going to have to dump fifty thousand into the house it is just to get them up you know we had a list of what we wanted in a house and our house was only seventeen years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted fireplace full dry basement you know two and a half car garage you know all the stuff but we wanted when a lot of the older houses wet basements gott birded down or you know the lots were packed so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the backyard and so it is really yeah they do not yeah they play in the creek down play golf yet 

Recording: (4105/ 9621) 
i do not know you know plymouth is so saturday with golf courses and my parents all through growing up they played golf and i really was interested in it um i just think enough is enough though i yeah um there is so many but 

Recording: (4106/ 9621) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain it is just coming down all over the place hail and lightning 

Recording: (4107/ 9621) 
yeah i take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it is biology i get a break i do not i am gonna take twenty nine hours of it 

Recording: (4108/ 9621) 
yeah yeah she is been known to do that too yep 

Recording: (4109/ 9621) 
she has no she has not worked since my sister magnum was born and magnum is twenty so she but the thing is i have got another i have got a a sister my sister magnum joe is my brother he is fifteen and a half and then i have a sister of a person who is twelve 

Recording: (4110/ 9621) 
uh and then just hope that it would drop and i mean what what you hear and read lately is that it really has not changed much uh and it but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready at some level to accept that i mean gas in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gee married so 

Recording: (4111/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4112/ 9621) 
those are the mass people you got to find out and figure out what needs they are going to roll into like when they get older you know you get into the wheelchair companies or something you know somewhere it is just going to be massive 

Recording: (4113/ 9621) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (4114/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4115/ 9621) 
and and that what they say that we have done to the language and everything else and and you are not a typical american but you know and then the next hour and a half they just say how bad americans are and you kind of think like well thanks for the exclusion but you still have been insulted me for an hour and a half 

Recording: (4116/ 9621) 
yeah well it is got a lot worse uh when i say a lot worse because if you know you say you do not have kids i got a kid twenty three years old and there was no place for him to play 

Recording: (4117/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (4118/ 9621) 
well it is not just in the schools it is in society um environment seems to be an answer to a lot of things and i it is i i just can not it is hard to imagine that that there is an easy fix or there is a fix and it is kind of frustrating because you can not point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed you know it is pervasive uh it is like the well if you heard about this in the news a woman two women rather than having an argument one a one them set fire to the other one 

Recording: (4119/ 9621) 
did he really 

Recording: (4120/ 9621) 
oh okay i thought well what you mean because like some 

Recording: (4121/ 9621) 
he uh told he never said much about it except he told about it one time when he was in a hospital up in japan after he was burned he said that he was in a ward with a bunch of other burden patients and and he said that uh some of them and him included were able to get up and walk around so the and i can see their philosophy the medics had the guys that could walk help wait on the guys that were bit bound and uh he was had been helping one guy that was pretty bad off this guy passed away and makes it and so they started to put on and get on to to something else where some of the other guys i am through i am not working anymore with them he told them and they said well yes you are what are you going to do send me back over to vietnam but they sent him home but he was he was uh not a very enthusiastic soldier i do not think at any time and especially after he came home 

Recording: (4122/ 9621) 
and that was very stressful 

Recording: (4123/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4124/ 9621) 
and so well shortly after he was held enough to go back to work why they were married 

Recording: (4125/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4126/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4127/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4128/ 9621)

Recording: (4130/ 9621) 
i think their coach is the best joke r uh is the best

um i am a pr major right now hoping to get into computer animation 

Recording: (4141/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4142/ 9621)

Recording: (4143/ 9621) 
um i first of all could not be a friend 

Recording: (4144/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4145/ 9621)

Recording: (4150/ 9621) 
i do not think it is the cartoons because come on if they are that stupid you know what i mean they they should not even be out on the street i am sorry 

Recording: (4151/ 9621) 
yeah yeah equal distance 

Recording: (4152/ 9621) 
probably but they do not they will not you know part of it is they feel flattered part of it is like wow the you know this guy thinks i am nice looking or whatever 

Recording: (4153/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4154/ 9621) 
okay fine and the family probably said okay we we want you to get advanced we want your good will the problem is you ran out of culture differences culture differences over here and so forth and then we became a little more uh promiscuous and so gee you know mom dad and so forth elm was going out here in the west coast with us you know so forth and they think everything is been okay because we did not have communication as frequent and then all of a sudden you find out and usually mom found out gee some does not sound right to the airwaves or to the riding some is mysterious going on here and you found out they were did not have any difficulties well the voice became acceptable before it was a no no and that is acceptable and then you had uh the celebrities becoming more than no oh hey we do not we do not get we do not get married anymore not okay then we had the idea of doing away with cash gold metal the metalic backing i think it was kennedy was the one that did that and said we will just uh print will have to run this area of notes notes notes and so now we keep credit we we by ourselves i will ever do a limit in the world and saying well hey we will just pay you more we pay you more country than fine but every time they print more it makes the money in your investment less hey who cares huh that is what they 

Recording: (4155/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4156/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4157/ 9621) 
nope 

Recording: (4158/ 9621) 
now when he goes to my sister is house and she has three cats and he is not around them 

Recording: (4159/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4160/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (4161/ 9621) 
excuse me 

Recording: (4162/ 9621) 
uh i kind of uh i i was like a rebel you know i did not really uh it was not really my cup of tea actually i had a pretty decent job i worked four and a half days a week uh basically in the uh mechanical type of things you know remove and replace what they do a lot now with cars um they put a thing on a machine and it says take that out you know try it you know and you put that in and so it is it and a high side you know it was it was cool but but i had i liked it longer it was uh back in the sixties so you know 

Recording: (4163/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4164/ 9621) 
which i mean is not necessarily a bad thing but i mean it is something that is definitely noticeable in there 

Recording: (4165/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4166/ 9621) 
i do not think that i would have them go to any i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party that kind of stuff was a lot more focus than i mean i did not even i do not think anybody even taught me how to write in cars so other than my parents so i mean it was it was interesting i mean there was a lot more cultural kind of kinds of things do a lot of things with nature and then they are kind of uh was the seventies too so i mean you have to look at the time what we are talking about but i have i feel like i do not see why i would not sign them to public schools 

Recording: (4167/ 9621) 
do you 

Recording: (4168/ 9621) 
um uh the the the public transit system i mean i know they are doing the best they can but i do not see how we are ever going to get out of this without light rail and i am really bummed 

Recording: (4169/ 9621) 
yeah avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do better decisions would help 

Recording: (4170/ 9621) 
this 

Recording: (4171/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4172/ 9621) 
if they are any germans in there i will bet they are scared 

Recording: (4173/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i do not see figure that out i think it is all i think it is all fixed 

Recording: (4174/ 9621) 
from high school and uh one in that original group of kids that i had never did pass them all but i guess he is not worried because he is going to work for his dad and his dad is business so he is going to be okay but he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but and the questions are not the same i mean there is several different forms every time they send out the test it is sealed in a box and nobody is allowed to open up at the principal and then he has to distribute it to the teachers and so the questions could change 

Recording: (4175/ 9621) 
do my um billing and stuff like yourself money 

Recording: (4176/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4177/ 9621) 
well then i think she would probably take her girlfriend out to the mall you know and party a lot too is uh socializing like that soccer and and things of that nature um-hum 

Recording: (4178/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4179/ 9621) 
yeah hoosier yeah so uh things pretty much in lubbock is public schools you know they do not they do not actually sit down with you they automatically assume that once you get to this level you are ready for this level and you go on 

Recording: (4180/ 9621) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (4181/ 9621) 
that is what i was actually thinking of um where he takes the pictures on the corner 

Recording: (4182/ 9621) 
no and it was just taking her out of her you know where she you know you grow up hearing those lies and 

Recording: (4183/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4184/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah yeah my my family my mom especially is just like when are you going to stop doing that yeah because he is sixteen months now and i think he is tapering off quite a bit so i think that he will be done soon but i am not pushing him so 

Recording: (4185/ 9621) 
you should you should be organized i am not i have this stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting next to my bed just went out and bought groceries and then the common is open again 

Recording: (4186/ 9621) 
i mean you just never know how freaky 

Recording: (4187/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4188/ 9621) 
i am sure yeah i mean uh she he does not throw women in her face no women call the house or anything uh you never know what she does not you know question him about where he is been or anything like that and i she just i just can not believe that i just think that is terrible 

Recording: (4189/ 9621) 
oh that is it 

Recording: (4190/ 9621) 
it is it is it is uh it is kind of a oasis in the middle of the city 

Recording: (4191/ 9621) 
yeah not me it is too expensive 

Recording: (4192/ 9621) 
it is more feasible than a six year old 

Recording: (4193/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4194/ 9621) 
yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (4195/ 9621) 
i have always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (4196/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4197/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4198/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4199/ 9621) 
and they see the same thing as weird back to them because they are making christ images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is what you go to bed night thinking what did we do positive day and build on the positive it may have been the smallest part of that sheet of paper 

Recording: (4200/ 9621) 
but she was never interested in never really interested in boys or in sports in high school or makeup clothes and things like that you you know you are setting yourself up for barbecue in high school for that and that is what happens she would come home and tear us because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going in within a couple months she got her ged 

Recording: (4201/ 9621) 
totto toot them all or on top of them all thirteen years um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum umhumuh i was going through divorce parents both parents passed away uh my ex moved to uh saint louis and did not tell me anything but other four clothes it on the house and that is how i found out that she moved and just uh a bunch of shit and i just started to screw her up so they wanted to put me on probation in my uh probation attitude or whatever so i quit i am pretty stupid running 

Recording: (4202/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4203/ 9621) 
yeah they are they are really good about that 

Recording: (4204/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4205/ 9621) 
those are the good days that is a good day that is when you are talking about low case tee i am talking about capitality 

Recording: (4206/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (4207/ 9621) 
i was going to then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh uh but that was one comment she was talking about but then only very very opposite extreme uh extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i am not quite sure how to address that because in a in a and some people would say now wait a minute you are talking out of both sides of your mouth the expression is how can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over here you are saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution 

Recording: (4208/ 9621) 
i think example is probably the best uh they see that you care and they learn to care i think my son john he is the youngest i think he is a very compassionate and so uh very spiritual young man uh more so than his brother is and that i always have to have to weigh that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better to give and i sometimes try to weigh that if that is part of why i i can not believe it is an attention catcher because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the work you do but uh but maybe just within maybe one feels uh and i think i think it is a matter of being conscientious too you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4209/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4210/ 9621) 
uh it is quite possible but we the day care that i thought was closest to um the one that was open that had the closest values that we had um i personally would like a church based program but there are not any well there were not any open when we were looking for one um we did have the option of going here to oh and shoot to their day care and it has a wonderful reputation and everybody that i have talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i did not like was so that they were not um imparting values on the children they do not celebrate any holidays at all so they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother is day care and i mean they are doing trick or treat thing on thursday they are going doortodoor they get a dress up where he would not have gotten any of that at all his shoe and they are pros and cons to to both of those but 

Recording: (4211/ 9621) 
well i am going to be to get a second job 

Recording: (4212/ 9621) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real weird too i was always like i mean like my friends were always like the because they used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the odd people in a in a small in a small midwestern part far mean the school is kind of odd i guess um um 

Recording: (4213/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4214/ 9621) 
yeah i i i loved one sixty one i loved it around there i loved all those core restaurants and everything 

Recording: (4215/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4216/ 9621) 
and getting back to the profanity and stuff that was another one was in the paper some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something almost their little kid maybe six or seven rate walked in there and said what the age you know for a letter word is this four and the father is ten and looks at me and after the kids walked out says um well where in the age do that child learn to talk like that so she gave himself away right away so she think it is the it is the ones that are teaching to kids and it is it is all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really it goes back to that and what can we do to change it i think as i said it basically everybody has to learn to think uh the other person and what is good for everybody not just me me me 

Recording: (4217/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (4218/ 9621) 
you know they can do it however they want 

Recording: (4219/ 9621) 
the profforcedity tests that they are now requiring you can not graduate from an ohio high school with a with a diploma unless you pass all the profancy tests and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time in the the end of the eighth grade then you get two tries in the ninth grade two tries in the tenth two in the eleventh and two in the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get this nifty little thing called an attendant certificate it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there 

Recording: (4220/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4221/ 9621)

Recording: (4301/ 9621) 
um probably for the most part i mean as long as they have a political background or something sort of can not say see any real difference i mean for the most part they have proven to be able to do anything else any guy can do so 

Recording: (4302/ 9621) 
well this is about given opinions and my opinion about the columbus public school system really is not good 

Recording: (4303/ 9621) 
that is what everybody when i tell people i play it that is what everybody says but it seems to me that any instrument can be hard depending i mean i can not see how anybody can play a clarinet for example but there are some things that are hard about playing the french horn one is that you can play many different notes with a single fingering 

Recording: (4304/ 9621) 
more cosmopolitan 

Recording: (4305/ 9621)

she was originally from southern ohio but uh while i was going she came to columbus and so i came here where i was discharged and i uh served a leadership of a seat metal worker is shop or well it was more than just i mean it was more than shop work we did election work too and commercial work and uh i stayed with that till uh well for twenty five so ever whenever that was then i got a chance to uh go to work for the city of columbia as a asian mentally inspector and i decided that it was that it was more away speed when i was that age so i worked for them for the city as uh inspected for twelve and a half years until i retired and uh my wife and i had four children four or three boys and a daughter uh the my son is old live here in columbus and my daughter is out in seattle in the red money area i have been active in church work sunday school all my life 

Recording: (4307/ 9621) 
well i think it starts with the family but the problem is in the last three years we have ever sized uh not i should not say thirty years push world war two push world war two is where he broke the family up and let me tell you i i i realize this during world war two we took the little lady out of the house and said hey we need you on the production lines make more machinery 

Recording: (4308/ 9621) 
and it is just like been so for him too this has been you know a a a real amazing road because by the time he was twenty eighty i had four kids and you know and and yet you know we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he is looking forward to he is thrilled about the the baby that my daughter is going to have but um i would have had a whole lot more kids you know i would have just kept having them and he said i will force plenty you know he needed a break 

Recording: (4309/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (4310/ 9621) 
i know it 

Recording: (4311/ 9621)

Recording: (4312/ 9621) 
my friend 

Recording: (4313/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4314/ 9621)

Recording: (4315/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4316/ 9621) 
that is ridiculous it is like barbaraism to me like uh 

Recording: (4317/ 9621) 
but now he is with that girl he was cheating on with he is with her now they live together so he is like going to a powerhouse too and i he is a they are like the real nice people it is just they just i you know feel like they do not and i try to tell them you know do not mess up again i just like grow up grow up 

Recording: (4318/ 9621) 
right yeah the middle of the may is when they usually start most of this stuff hm you can cool your insulation um-hum 

Recording: (4319/ 9621) 
i have become visually decentized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather gruesome events in history that still are very i still find disturbing um ah uh also hang out in little life bars and every once in a while they will be fighting fight and it it is still i mean i it it is still is disturbing to me i i i i have a distinct difference in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like are not making that distinction but i i do not think so and i think if if someone is not making that distinion it is i do not know that that they are not uh i i do not know i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have a i feel that i have a distinct uh just a a very clear distinction between what is uh fact and what is fiction what is true and what is imaginary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that like television has affected me is i am full of media references when i speak you know where i am hanging out with friends someone mentioned a a subject and i am like hey simpson is made fun of that you know at some point uh uh that is the effect that it sees on me i do not think that is too big on effect people are always used to you know like quote shakesby or something i guess that is ten times more elevator so like oh but the references to the shakes by line or something but i mean it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it and 

Recording: (4320/ 9621) 
but we are working on it we have got a couple of hospitals in right now and see how things go 

Recording: (4321/ 9621) 
yeah and i i just i guess i just felt like it looks it is kind of i mean i i think that that is kind of neat and if you are looking at traffic and and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back the amount of money that you paid a park downtown is outrageous um even just having to it takes i know when it is when it was snowing because i worked on i worked on front street and where i would come for i live on buffalo road which is i would take basketball to three fifteen down through downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i would not have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking why why not do that and now there is also the whole pollution thing and and this types of things and i thought that was 

Recording: (4322/ 9621) 
because of your internal clock 

Recording: (4323/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4324/ 9621) 
and uh my oldest son uh uh completed what they call a god and country award in the church which is a a requires requires about as much work as uh eagle of wood in the scouts it is uh a scout is sponsored by church centered uh award and then my second son caught a his eagle award in the scouts i am kind of proud of that because it uh well it is not something that a lot of kids do you know 

Recording: (4325/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4326/ 9621) 
i did not like it but i liked elements of it and it is unlike the the first stars movie this one really is meant to be part of a trilogy the first stars movie when it came out i mean it was in many ways an experiment it was but part of a of a larger story 

Recording: (4327/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4328/ 9621) 
my mom 

Recording: (4329/ 9621)

Recording: (4333/ 9621)

Recording: (4334/ 9621) 
when northland moves and all that that the existing building she thinks they should turn into a discount store

Recording: (4346/ 9621) 
that is about right that is about right i think it is just general central you know that is 

Recording: (4347/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4348/ 9621) 
i can not see a lot of substance uh he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then sort of back does not really back track it is just like it is not anything really firm i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what the points they wanted to make and i do not hear that coming from bush 

Recording: (4349/ 9621)

Recording: (4353/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4354/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (4355/ 9621)

Recording: (4356/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4357/ 9621) 
uh-huh

and then yeah i got the opportunity um a a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back 

Recording: (4359/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4360/ 9621) 
no not like they used to 

Recording: (4361/ 9621) 
you know it is it is just sad in our society that that is what it is turning to 

Recording: (4362/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (4363/ 9621) 
yeah it is usually like about a third or something um i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus it is just basically getting out of the house 

Recording: (4364/ 9621)

Recording: (4365/ 9621) 
the personal thing is you need to have ethics

Recording: (4367/ 9621) 
right um 

Recording: (4368/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4369/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4370/ 9621)

Recording: (4371/ 9621) 
and i think eighty four 

Recording: (4372/ 9621) 
i uh grew up in is this is this registering it it slipped 

Recording: (4373/ 9621) 
i see that place year yeah it would be great if somebody you know they go out and pump all this money into a vote unfortunately whatever the government pumps money into an area you know that tends to be like a uh foreign country gets it you know and 

Recording: (4374/ 9621) 
yeah i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

Recording: (4375/ 9621) 
um i would say it does not really matter either way honestly i mean fact of the matter is they are so deal with it i mean get over it i mean 

Recording: (4376/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4377/ 9621) 
yeah teach one person one thing and not teach the other person that kind of let me see here given example there is a there is a school that they showed on twenty twenty somewhere out west i believe it is nevada or somewhere and they said that these uh teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation because of their actual sitting down and hands on the hands on of course that is one thing these children like uh exgirl friend of mine she was pretty much i would not put her border line in illiterate but she did not know how to read or write 

Recording: (4378/ 9621) 
i could i could it might take me a uh a year or two

Recording: (4383/ 9621) 
caren could see a weapon they are going to slap him on the arm 

Recording: (4384/ 9621) 
and teresa the foundation also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children 

Recording: (4385/ 9621) 
something to think about 

Recording: (4386/ 9621) 
yeah it is just what i can not understand is some people living up in arlington and some they get to private school 

Recording: (4387/ 9621) 
not for long 

Recording: (4388/ 9621) 
and that is what we did and so he is just like my own too now i go and volunteer he is in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it is kind of like i hope i get to do this forever 

Recording: (4389/ 9621) 
absentee 

Recording: (4390/ 9621)

Recording: (4398/ 9621) 
a nurse practitioner i guess to diagnose and see patients um the state of ohio is i think the only state that has a given um nurse practitioner where we can write our own prescriptions so we can see patients do the physicals we can suggest medications i guess per se but then the physician has to come in and come from our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions 

Recording: (4399/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (4400/ 9621) 
so that broke that up and he still messed around her and then he was dating another girl and i like told on him and that made him not like me for a while

Recording: (4402/ 9621) 
yeah i do i and and if i read it every day i try to and um and i when we go to church i have all sorts of activities i do and i just always feeling like i am reimbursed that it is not just some sort of plaky idea that it is for me that it is um real and and it it just always makes sense that is important to me that i feel like it makes sense 

Recording: (4403/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4404/ 9621) 
yeah that is kind of subjective although there is a paper that we hand out to our kids that tells exactly what is supposed to be in every part of the essay like the first the introduction program supposed to consist of a way to capture the reader is attention as opposed to supply background information it is supposed to state your thesis statement which tells mainly what the paper is going to be about and then there is just the end the introduction paragraph by listing three ideas about your thesis that you are going to develop in paragraphs two three and four so i mean it is 

Recording: (4405/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4406/ 9621) 
and he knew it was a bush or or 

Recording: (4407/ 9621)

Recording: (4409/ 9621) 
yeah i like to go up there and play pool once in a while 

Recording: (4410/ 9621) 
then you are really going to get out of it what you need to 

Recording: (4411/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4412/ 9621) 
and i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it was pretty old and there were just things that he would do and i guess just picking up watching him seeing what he would do that is 

Recording: (4413/ 9621) 
that is just like a tone take everything you got that your real father got you 

Recording: (4414/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4415/ 9621)

yeah they really like it they have a huge house in the middle of nowhere out on a farm and my brotherinlaw bought uh his father is wendy is businesses out and so they own like six wendy is out there so but it is out in the middle of the nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move and tried to get him to do this years and years ago and nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really tough running five windows in nebraska and commuting so he was either driving or flying a lot 

Recording: (4419/ 9621) 
and i have always felt good about it but people always said oh you you do not even pray you know like a wendy is paper or all this stuff and once you make a decision like that you do not pray things like that you do not even think about it

Recording: (4424/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4425/ 9621) 
ten to fifteen minutes so yeah we stay pretty close with each other a lot 

Recording: (4426/ 9621) 
right education definitely and it is military so 

Recording: (4427/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4428/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4429/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (4430/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4431/ 9621) 
very much so because there is two thousand undergraduates and basically eighteen hundred of them live on campus and then if you live off campus like i would like to think i do not have trouble making friends but like the but i have had friends get arrested by the police because after ten thirty like the university their their vehicles they 

Recording: (4432/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4433/ 9621) 
um you know i i just got back from a year in england so i am not sure about the new 

Recording: (4434/ 9621) 
and they see not as many european men attend math but in in a church yesterday i thought about that i noticed how many men there are who do go to church in the united states 

Recording: (4435/ 9621) 
the um white house like 

Recording: (4436/ 9621) 
yeah that was after i got kicked out and i just decided how i will go to work work for a couple months make something out of it i learned to trade 

Recording: (4437/ 9621) 
he was you know pretty much promised a free ride through osh is music program and he turned that and he turned that away and i i do not you know if he regrets that i really have no idea uh he just does not will not talk to us about things like that he does talk to his girlfriend about it and she is become very close with my wife and she is never had an adult really did i i am in to her of any kind even my she wants to go to school and my wife is agreed to go with her when she goes for the interviews and stuff because she says she does not know what to ask or anything and 

Recording: (4438/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4439/ 9621) 
his speed was like say seventy miles an hour before and now it is going to be twenty because he does not know how to do it and that is the problem they are running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and you know everything but now they have got to do this extra part which is going to make their job easier down the road but everybody hates change so what they are doing now is it they are having problems because people can not take the volume of airplanes because they are trying to keep up with the computer so it is making it even slower yet but once they get in you know in the swing of things it will be okay but you know you are you are talking a while you know because it is not something that you can do overnight but it would be like your dad learning the computer he is not going to do it overnight 

Recording: (4440/ 9621) 
and um apparently when you are a car um they have a very very like zero tolerance 

Recording: (4441/ 9621) 
uh my family personally my parents uh my parents my father was born and raised in daytonah beach my mother was born and raised in uh portsmouth ohio both of them are ohio state graduates my father was a cpa my mother was a school teacher but did not work at when we were kids actually they met at last service working at last service yeah they both were different you know he was in oh yeah they both worked during college and and i guess my dad was on the gi bill after the war so that is how he got in here and had to work some parttime work to get his degree uh-huh it is just east broad street just franklin park and 

Recording: (4442/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (4443/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (4444/ 9621) 
uh they have been just troubled kids in the past they have 

Recording: (4445/ 9621) 
not only toward with us the children but just to other people also you know how mother used to feed the bums that would come uh at the front door and she would fix some food and so she she was a very 

Recording: (4446/ 9621) 
again with the news reports with uh um different bombings and the i think the jewish school caught my attention and now that he is in day care i mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always kind of wonder what is going on he is done quite well he is i mean he is one of those scissors how to color he is socially learning how to play with other kids those were all things he was not doing at home potty training is been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and 

Recording: (4447/ 9621) 
expended bus service 

Recording: (4448/ 9621) 
uh-huh well speaking of acoustics i i do not know if i am you have to tell me if i am going off the subject or you know if you need to ask me something else okay um this is another interesting story my church choir is a very important part of the church up there um have you ever been to the church up there should visit some time although you are only going to be here for another month the summer is not necessarily the best time to visit 

Recording: (4449/ 9621) 
and i am hoping to get i am i am going to get a puppy and a kitten together 

Recording: (4450/ 9621) 
if they are especially if they are over forty because their company is giving money back to the community for this and that and you know that is how they are trying to show that they care about this they are trying to mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the down trodden or you know but you are right i think it is terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do better science skills than we do better language skills than we do well canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve you know and i just think that this proficient thing is finally going to make people accountable 

Recording: (4451/ 9621) 
anyway and um i am not saying in general but with the experiences that i have had um certain families where they do not uh socioeconomic just not as well off 

Recording: (4452/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4453/ 9621) 
yeah quite a bit yeah i have seen columbus grow from the for a from the time i have you know lived here as a child you know uh one sixty one you know double and grandville road you know i can remember when that was all country 

Recording: (4454/ 9621) 
yeah but you just have to have something to go by and just as closely you know we have to just go with it you know i mean you can not go back and try to read the i do not sometimes somebody was trying to rearrange the calendar one time were not they 

Recording: (4455/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4456/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4457/ 9621) 
the day i left the hospital he was running around with him and he 

Recording: (4458/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4459/ 9621) 
and i was thirty nine 

Recording: (4460/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4461/ 9621) 
i really am not educated in that at all so i would not probably say anything since i would ignorant it in the field 

Recording: (4462/ 9621) 
oh no we just had a whole conversation come on now 

Recording: (4463/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4464/ 9621) 
well he is two main uh main characters in his cartoon and for willie and joe 

Recording: (4465/ 9621) 
oh yeah i uh i think she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and stuff while she was growing up uh you know mine uh my values and stuff basically are a more religious oriented you know uh than i would say my wife is but uh uh so i think she she knows what i value is being important what i value is being not important and but on the the rest of the question you know i would i would love to be able to do a boat uh but uh every other weekend sounds good you know that is far as a 

Recording: (4466/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4467/ 9621) 
and that is when they said no 

Recording: (4468/ 9621) 
have you ever been there 

Recording: (4469/ 9621) 
oh yeah e gerbil 

Recording: (4470/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4471/ 9621) 
and so i got to be the first graduating class of this brand new school that they built because the old one had just overflowed beyond all recognition 

Recording: (4472/ 9621) 
uh i can not say that really bothered me too much i mean it is the same thing as having a woman gym teacher or whatever 

Recording: (4473/ 9621) 
i was in seventy eight um and then i have just i have stayed there and it is grown a lot and the work changes it is an interesting place to work because uh well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening or trying to stay out in front of what in front of what library innovation in front of web and that innovation and trying to incorporate it all so it is it is you know it is kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master the project i am working on now uh just trying to find a way to to automatic to create data that describes web resources so the libraries can take this data and put it in a catalog and in a agree with a regular collection and we are doing a lot of with yeah it is it is pretty it is a neat projects a lot of new things the uh jama and the web give us opportunities to do things that we have talked about before but could not really do very well so it is pretty neat 

Recording: (4474/ 9621) 
for people to read i think there is enough other resources out there if somebody is interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that um i know for for me just because i have so many younger brothers and sisters and and my family and everything i know how i have got some some some pretty pretty what i feel are pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i know that my mom always can solve me you know like my sister you know she got her the deed front which vananda is just she is this girl is almost crazy she is so bright i mean she really is yeah it is one of those things where she just does not turn in her stuff you know and it is she is twelve 

Recording: (4475/ 9621) 
just a teeny bit 

Recording: (4476/ 9621) 
we are all in columbus 

Recording: (4477/ 9621) 
that is why i started 

Recording: (4478/ 9621) 
it was so amazing to be back in america 

Recording: (4479/ 9621) 
no no um my i was born in new york i was in plano um i then went through tennessee with my family and that was after i was six months old 

Recording: (4480/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4481/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4482/ 9621) 
he seems pretty arrogant i do not think he is done really too much for columbus they need to get a younger coach they need some a new 

Recording: (4483/ 9621) 
the competition aspect 

Recording: (4484/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (4485/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4486/ 9621) 
yeah well like um 

Recording: (4487/ 9621) 
because we wanted to be because it is a privilege not because oh i got to go to another play you know my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theater and i was sure had eighteen performances because i could be free i did not i did not want to pay ten bucks every time to see it but if i usured i could be in the audience every time you know and for my parents to have no interest in seeing seeing play baseball or swam some fry away and you know or not play they they would not they do not even want to be bothered with that that is just to them it is just and i can not understand that 

Recording: (4488/ 9621) 
yeah yeah so that is pretty much what she likes to do 

Recording: (4489/ 9621) 
your later uh-huh 

Recording: (4490/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4491/ 9621) 
i do not 

Recording: (4492/ 9621) 
true communism not as it was practiced in russia but uh where people uh share and uh share power and share money and equally but with the where we are in our evolution we are not ready for it i actually i when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an attentional community which was actually crying 

Recording: (4493/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4494/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4495/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4496/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4497/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4498/ 9621) 
so because he and i always discussed politics and so 

Recording: (4499/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (4500/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4501/ 9621) 
there generally tends to be at least one or two republicans that vote for each each each election and sometimes i voted straight democrat because i just you know i even voted for dorphy peter the first time she even ran for county commissioner uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and i liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i i did not vote for her after that well the first time she ran for a county commission i did at one because she was a woman and i like you know i it was not possible i would like to vote for women 

Recording: (4502/ 9621) 
and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute you know i my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to you know get all the opportunities that were out there for them and and it just did not happen that you know that we both had the same he wanted everything to be the same you know so i think that really changed everything one kind of it does your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody is listening and everything you want to do somebody is watching and 

Recording: (4503/ 9621) 
you are kind of 

Recording: (4504/ 9621) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the side and then you got all these people you know i have been in the fights in my neighborhood and well my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out outlandish behavior i mean i caught i actually wrote up on a couple of people down the street from me having sacks through a fence 

Recording: (4505/ 9621) 
i am so much more relaxed i mean with the pressures that these kids these days have on them and you are right without families at home to give them the guidance i mean at collin might have i am not mistaken that was the one who had the journal who had somebody had made bombs in the garage and the family did not know about it and i was like how can a family not know that but if they are so busy and working and trying to provide uh sure 

Recording: (4506/ 9621) 
and then uh up tending grad school 

Recording: (4507/ 9621) 
parmits the 

Recording: (4508/ 9621) 
it will be fun 

Recording: (4509/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4510/ 9621) 
yeah they are just so 

Recording: (4511/ 9621) 
yeah because they go back in three days 

Recording: (4512/ 9621) 
some of the ordinary peoplewe are both into genealogy on our perspective families and you can find a lot out of our families and you start going to in fact you may you forgot one that i found i had do not you remember we were over over in that their library in pennsylvania and i he came back when we sit there laughing i am trying to laugh out loud and he said what so funny uh all the names i am looking for from all my family he is funny things for his family and everything other you know i found one of them way back in what was it sixteen seventy or something this boat load of people come over from england and they were the ones that had been deported from england because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or were the thief or something and i said would you read the only reason i could find on my family is nothing but a convict you know you even got deported from the country i do not know why he was you know that that is a ship he was on 

Recording: (4513/ 9621) 
tooks 

Recording: (4514/ 9621) 
ah four twenty five 

Recording: (4515/ 9621) 
i think i would like if you had to ask i would say i was a straight midwestern suburban but there are people that i go to school with and ashland is twenty five thousand like in the city 

Recording: (4516/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4517/ 9621) 
it does not have to cost anything but you you can go do it with your family or whatever so yeah 

Recording: (4518/ 9621) 
go but they are always stopping something and they do not seem to move forward very well 

Recording: (4519/ 9621) 
no i do not either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel taken a life like that leaving someone there just to die 

Recording: (4520/ 9621) 
that you went back to 

Recording: (4521/ 9621) 
that will be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (4522/ 9621) 
they really have no selfworth because you know uh i know a long time ago i we went to a uh uh it was that was like a a seminar for the ivy league schools which i looked at the tuition and went uh you know there was no way but and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man that there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever and uh they said you know if your if your child makes three days and uh applies at our school we do not want them and i am like what he says uh he says we look at two two children sitting side by side this one is making straight a days this one sort of made beef but this one over here got into track when he or she was in freshmen and and we noticed every track we they basically were were like last or second to last but they did it for four years then they 

Recording: (4523/ 9621) 
being goofy 

Recording: (4524/ 9621) 
you know the stuff like that has always been around but it seems now that the guns are more you can get them easier well it is like me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they going to do to me 

Recording: (4525/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4526/ 9621) 
so yeah i think um as a whole we have all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary i mean we do not have the same belief system and anything anymore so it is kind of like oh jeez 

Recording: (4527/ 9621) 
if they 

Recording: (4528/ 9621) 
and the safety of the neighborhood and it there are a few things really to go into it 

Recording: (4529/ 9621) 
do you really 

Recording: (4530/ 9621) 
around more than somebody else 

Recording: (4531/ 9621) 
so i think that those four kids at least among my grandchildren are getting pretty much at the same training that i did or maybe better than i got uh my oldest son is two daughters are well they are good kids and they are smart kids but i do not think that they have the moral grounding that uh reagan best kids do you said this is all continental 

Recording: (4532/ 9621) 
they 

Recording: (4533/ 9621) 
and move on um that is that is basically my fear but uh that was one of the guys trying to help me said well listen i am afraid of that too so so because right there in that pit there that is god and if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much where in there although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people praying and they are prayed with their heart and they tell you because of the how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart out a bunch of real fancy words and and a real comfortable setting you know that that he 

Recording: (4534/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4535/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4536/ 9621) 
veringham alabama 

Recording: (4537/ 9621) 
yeah it is it is and there is nothing to guarantee that i would not have the same result which is not to say that someday i will not get back into teaching but uh i might uh 

Recording: (4538/ 9621) 
uh that is why okay 

Recording: (4539/ 9621) 
right in there yep and i had friends that lived in um a cad 

Recording: (4540/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4541/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (4542/ 9621) 
no i never did i i do not know of any people that do but but it was also for me i think if i know something is true i i just know it and then as long as it keeps on being true over and over again if it is not just some exciting thing that for one day it is like oh this is great but like six months later it still has the same still ringing true and a year later two years later than that type of thing 

Recording: (4543/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4544/ 9621) 
um i just think it is uh horribly biased paper they do not really take their uh what is that uh the journalistic like unbiased integrity do not take that seriously 

Recording: (4545/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4546/ 9621) 
i mean yes some people 

Recording: (4547/ 9621) 
i had high pretend when i had the first two and then uh the last two i had now i got cardiovascular disease i still got one of murderers about eighty percent block i got another one fifty percent block and i got a dead spot on my heart right now so when i exercise uh my heart slows down let us put it this way where i work at i work here at osu

Recording: (4550/ 9621)

Recording: (4552/ 9621) 
we just agreed to get divorced he went to he you know i did not even see the lawyer he just brought the papers for me to sign and 

Recording: (4553/ 9621)

Recording: (4555/ 9621) 
so he uh you know he was strictly a union man you know so he kept his he believed in the unions you know so the railroaders was union you know 

Recording: (4556/ 9621) 
well it probably would have been yep but they felt that i would change and uh i have also been a vegetarian for twenty two years and when i first decided to do that everybody was saying oh you will change wait you get married you will you know and i do not eat any animals at all um and it is was just a conscious um decision 

Recording: (4557/ 9621) 
i think it was the east side you think it is i mean it was a while ago he he has not been there for a while yeah uh-huh

i i find i enjoy it is one of my my favorite classes actually for for an elective 

Recording: (4562/ 9621) 
and i am like you know what hospital is that you know where where what jury you know uh so a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multimillion dollar lawsuits are is is a lie um even the lady that i mean sued mcdonald is for spilling the coffee on herself because you put it in a garage with a lid off you know uh uh there ought to be a common sense clubs and lawsuits you know their own stupidity uh and then you get the attorneys trying to argue that well mcdonald is coffee is hotter than every other coffee 

Recording: (4563/ 9621)

Recording: (4576/ 9621) 
things when we were in north africa there was one german gun that was firing on us and they could not figure where he was 

Recording: (4577/ 9621) 
you mean that is what you 

Recording: (4578/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (4579/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4580/ 9621) 
yeah i think so um met quite a few people from cleveland and then my roommate from north canton 

Recording: (4581/ 9621) 
mother he used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i i think we should talk i was like okay great because i was like oh boy you are way too serious for this particular there okay that is fine but we knew ahead of time the walls were coming in and so i i um at this point in the store i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw it never it it is anyway not real even in all of the story but it bugs me every time i know of a story because it does not exist anyway so then we come back inside and it is like well i have got some bad news and my sister is like what you know i am like oh okay go ahead and he is like no i i think you are should sit down i am like all right 

Recording: (4582/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4583/ 9621) 
we have uh yeah we 

Recording: (4584/ 9621) 
the herbs the herbs 

Recording: (4585/ 9621) 
i used to when i was driving uh uh especially when i was going through the uh going to two seventy things you know i had people flip me off and stuff like that and it was a funny thing one time a guy is split me off because he was going slow and uh i got all pissed off about him and went around him and everything you know and i go to that more point of national chemical and he pulls in beside me but yeah i look over at him he looked at me like you know i am sorry i mean you know 

Recording: (4586/ 9621) 
it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (4587/ 9621) 
i think more what they need to do is districts or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like like people like the asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you are so serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it even some cases even changing up and beating public for it um i think not to sound too vential but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it um i think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they are going to get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are you are not even going to get thirty days in jail and you are going to be like oh i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (4588/ 9621) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple times and i do not know he just impresses me more than al gore 

Recording: (4589/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4590/ 9621) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (4591/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4592/ 9621) 
that is probably what i will do ignore to until like august or july and then start paying attention 

Recording: (4593/ 9621) 
i mean there is always been the nerves and um i do not know when i was growing up in the seventies there really was not punk or anything like that and i think um unfortunately i mean there is always got to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they have just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by uh um a jog 

Recording: (4594/ 9621) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they meant no huhuh i i would come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i you know used to live in the country and i moved into a smack avenue in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (4595/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4596/ 9621) 
well i am saying that 

Recording: (4597/ 9621) 
it is that is weird 

Recording: (4598/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4599/ 9621) 
well i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent there to me there is worse things worse things i would think than than dying you know the like i know in israel the guy who killed vietnam he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (4600/ 9621) 
and i have a wife been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven both of them one is in second grade and the other one is still in day care at ohio state university 

Recording: (4601/ 9621) 
right and if he if he is open minded enough to do it eventually he will see the light and say well this will make it a lot easier but there are people who are like i will not do this you know so those are the ones that have to be drug screaming and kicking 

Recording: (4602/ 9621) 
it is salt water fish 

Recording: (4603/ 9621) 
um i mean at that point i i certainly did not have any real knowledge about any of that sort of thing uh you know they covered the basics um they did talk about condoms and um contradictory i remember we watched a film which everyone was very embarrassed by um i mean i do not really uh they uh they did send home a package to the parents because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom to talk with me about it 

Recording: (4604/ 9621) 
yeah the procreation part of what marriage is all about but i see marriage as more than just propaganda 

Recording: (4605/ 9621) 
and she ran a fork lift into one pole and from busting her nose and chip her shoes just a dangerous woman and um so uh she gets a lot of tickets sometimes when she is not getting her yeah when she is not running into pools and stuff um and you know we use them because they do not they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home we do that a lot too but 

Recording: (4606/ 9621) 
yeah the same thing you were talking about and we were only the third people to live in it and so it needed everything you know and it had gold now gold back but in those days everything was like gold and you know and green it was horrible and uh it was great fun we had we had a lot of fun we we took the back porch and made a part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on the changed the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put it in ground pool and so i always joked because what i paid for it i now all three times that amount on it 

Recording: (4607/ 9621) 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack uh on the bottom uh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be i know my the most effective penalty for me was my mother uh would uh go out near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder and you know it left marks but it and it it hurt i mean it was stained and i understood exactly what was i think i grew up and i ended up being i think a quite successful person and i think my mother had uh uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty well young decent kids and none of us were injured none of them were hurt uh and that was a basic method of penalty it it was not something that truly hurt injured uh not today however uh i suspect my mom could easily be could have been charged with abuse that child abuse because it left a mark across my shoulder where that uh green sweat it was always a green sweat because uh there is the old ones they would break you do not want to break break 

Recording: (4608/ 9621) 
like tennis shoes or that 

Recording: (4609/ 9621) 
yeah i i you know get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with them you know because i do put when i get home with them i you know sit down to his abc is one two threes but he loves to read books so i try to get her to do that instead of just letting them play all day and 

Recording: (4610/ 9621) 
i would like to be you know but she lives i keep telling her we she would move down here but i am not moving to toledo i do not like toledo 

Recording: (4611/ 9621) 
yeah right 

Recording: (4612/ 9621) 
i am just an operator right now i have done production work too for them 

Recording: (4613/ 9621) 
um i mean they did not really do anything too extensive on it they basically as far as religion class go they basically told what the catholic church believed about it and how they felt about it but i mean they did not really condam or support it or anything like that i mean they they basically did realize that it is more up to the person i mean 

Recording: (4614/ 9621) 
interactive they are 

Recording: (4615/ 9621) 
well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it is been it is been a while from there so it that is not something that that right now i have had any anything like that so 

Recording: (4616/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4617/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah but but but many people especially the kid that young may not know what that really means and may it to be part of the group and part of the you know be cool may go along with it when really they do not like it i do not i have not made up my mind about him whether he is telling the truth or whether he has not or whether he was not 

Recording: (4618/ 9621) 
yeah it got boring it got frustrating because we uh you get these new people moving in and you know you are used to everything being nice you know and then yeah people next door breaking into your upstairs from you breaking into each just 

Recording: (4619/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4620/ 9621) 
we want a dog and we have kind of been waiting um but i like both animals 

Recording: (4621/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4622/ 9621) 
oh that is right 

Recording: (4623/ 9621) 
oh no 

Recording: (4624/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4625/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4626/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4627/ 9621) 
yeah or yeah you know it is tough when you know you got kids that are doing softball soccer you know all these events and you know like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually drives from work to the softball and after that she home by nine so she is like i can see how you are falling to this drive through window business business you know not but luckily you know i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can find feed them and i get them so that is how our life is mister mom 

Recording: (4628/ 9621) 
well i was with um i am mormon so we i do not know if you ever ever seen how they go two by two always and i was with what we call another sister i was and we would live in an apartment and we would pay for our own mission and there was a mission president and they had different people with responsibilities leaders and that would watch over you and make sure you know call in the every night and check on you but it was really up to us what we wanted to do we were we would get up and leave at nine thirty and be home by nine thirty or whenever it got dark 

Recording: (4629/ 9621) 
that is pretty good never had to borrow any money never went on welfare did not i think i was on food steps or something for a month 

Recording: (4630/ 9621) 
i forget the name well i do not think there is a university of portland but there is two two or yes there is a university i can not think of which one it is right now but speaking of opinions did you see the paper today about the thing in seattle they are having this speaking 

Recording: (4631/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4632/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4633/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4634/ 9621) 
hist elements 

Recording: (4635/ 9621) 
there is a huge wind tunnel yeah 

Recording: (4636/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4637/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4638/ 9621) 
but the federal government and their lawyers have done that and the department of the interior still considered native americans on the same level as a dog they do not have rights there is something wrong there and that still goes on a day after about six hundred years and we have got good people in this country that want to do something about it but unfortunately you know what i am finding you you got everybody is got to choose their path 

Recording: (4639/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (4640/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4641/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4642/ 9621) 
well in the future 

Recording: (4643/ 9621) 
do you really 

Recording: (4644/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i do not know if you remember you might not be quite old enough but you may know the song shaneo conner nothing compares to you when 

Recording: (4645/ 9621) 
uh what went on there uh a lot of happy strippers in town so or i should say exotic dance so 

Recording: (4646/ 9621) 
very big i mean probably down the line because like we are still struggling to get up you know we are waiting for that million dollar check 

Recording: (4647/ 9621) 
sit now he is back in a long care until something else better comes along 

Recording: (4648/ 9621) 
and i it just i know it sounds crazy but i would rather have ten animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals than children i do not know why i knew at a very young age that i just was not important to me it would not be a part of my life 

Recording: (4649/ 9621) 
i know another thing about the kids nowadays is it is uh devon i experienced it with her you know this uh i sent her a hundred dollars one time you know just for her and she sat there and said uh i called her up a couple days later or about a week a week later something like that and uh said what would you do with that uh what would you get with that money and everything she goes well you know i bought a gap tshirt and a uh cd i said um-hum she goes uh what do you mean uh-huh that is what i bought i said you bought a cd and a blouse 

Recording: (4650/ 9621) 
you know that is a real major question is not it uh no i do not think it is too bad i mean uh well well we could go into the issue of uh the columbus board of education what is his name he is always 

Recording: (4651/ 9621) 
they had a strong uh public uh support over there it is a really tight neck community it is uh quite different columbus needs a learned lot from the area and uh it is a matter of just uh putting i guess your hands in the you are practicing your faith which we 

Recording: (4652/ 9621) 
open that tunnel and they fired a couple of ourselves into the tunnel and then took off 

Recording: (4653/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4654/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4655/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (4656/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4657/ 9621) 
yeahright and he uh he also was uh broken into but he came through his bathroom window 

Recording: (4658/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4659/ 9621) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (4660/ 9621) 
um so they are coming off and i there is been like divorced papers and stuff and and i know that police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents i do not personally think that the worst documents are that important but nothing is beyond the real possibility for people to take things away out way too seriously if yes 

Recording: (4661/ 9621) 
well see we have real traditional um breakdown of of choice but only because that is just happened to be what we liked it the way we like it do you know what i mean and it is it is not um because you know i consider i my whole house a lot of feminist you know we are all real strong about that but the thing is since i have the luxury of being at home and peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and i am doing something i enjoy i really am happy to do all of those things that typically women do because that is my job that is my trade off you know i do not have to go some place else i can get i can go and have coffee every day with my daughters i can go you do whatever i want and i am happy to do these other things 

Recording: (4662/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4663/ 9621) 
i think that is that would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4664/ 9621) 
yeah exactly medicaid i think i think it is a 

Recording: (4665/ 9621) 
everyday the other one i do not see that much anymore 

Recording: (4666/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4667/ 9621) 
i do not think that changed my mind about anything i mean i do not approve of his immoral behavior but it does not change the way he runs the country 

Recording: (4668/ 9621) 
let us see 

Recording: (4669/ 9621) 
yeah i contribute it to too many people there is too many people there is not enough commitment it is too easy to get divorced and uh the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of um just people everywhere and young people today i do not uh you know i do not know what the statistics are gonna be but they i do not think they have a good idea of what marriage even is you know before and also before marriage was a commitment to uh a type of lifestyle and that lifestyle has gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and as equally as independent then it might it might work but um i you know and he knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (4670/ 9621) 
oh that is great 

Recording: (4671/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (4672/ 9621) 
it just just kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breast feeding is you know a way to mother and nurt and feed and you know it it meets all of these needs it is kind of like it is just yeah um-hum um-hum yeah well one of my well age league leaders she has a phd and she does a lot of reading and she said that she actually read a study that they did um from breast fed babies to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their iq is equivalent to uh a regular bottle fed baby and a baby exposed to lead poisoning it is that much higher even so i mean it is just given i am not much of a better head start on development so 

Recording: (4673/ 9621) 
yeah but um some names are just like oh we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not never expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother is name was harryette 

Recording: (4674/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4675/ 9621) 
place for computers at my plants at the corner and then have my little paper sack 

Recording: (4676/ 9621) 
so i you know they pile hey you resemble that remark you know 

Recording: (4677/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4678/ 9621) 
where are you from 

Recording: (4679/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4680/ 9621) 
well i think all through growing up there is always been you know different kind of kids 

Recording: (4681/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4682/ 9621) 
oh uh that is what he does he is not real interested in farming although his major pastime is going out on his tractor and mowing lawn and and doing other miscellaneous things he really likes his tractors he really likes his tractors but uh and he was raised he was raised in suburbia so the the tractor thing is a whole new thing for him so he is you know he really he really likes it he is from rochester new york yeah my mom is from akron yeah um actually uh one of my dad is really good friends went to the same church nomination that my mom did and my dad went with his friend and to a summer camp that they had and that is where they actually first met and my dad was extremely taken with her 

Recording: (4683/ 9621) 
do you have it at three oclock 

Recording: (4684/ 9621) 
now i had a cat that is just 

Recording: (4685/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is got a unconditional love out there 

Recording: (4686/ 9621) 
yeah they do i thought it was really cool we went hiking in the alps and somebody told us that um 

Recording: (4687/ 9621) 
for that for for that so he he got locked up and he is not allowed to see another human being 

Recording: (4688/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4689/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (4690/ 9621) 
it has a lot to do with the fact that the that they the church 

Recording: (4691/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4692/ 9621) 
i think in fifth grade was the first 

Recording: (4693/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4694/ 9621) 
i think that is kind of where i am coming from gin and i know you uh jan i i mean what my sister does i just say to her i just really admire it i can not give as much as she gives i just do not have that same spirit she has but uh it is great to see i mean she is real she really when she is with the people i do not know i have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and you can lead a better life but jana just develops them with her kindness and um probably has less expectations from the people she works with 

Recording: (4695/ 9621) 
ah i would not be surprised 

Recording: (4696/ 9621) 
time to go all right i am down here 

Recording: (4697/ 9621) 
i do not think so now with the diversity that we have here 

Recording: (4698/ 9621) 
get back to god get back to believing in god and the values that the family should have i do not know how is that connected well god did not teach you to go out and shoot your neighbor and he did not go out and tell you to steal from him and he did not tell you to uh ignore him the rest of your life he did not tell you that they are down there bleeding into there uh walking trying the other way i mean he taught you to help and be loving toward each other and and it is liking a lot of people today as i said it that is that old me me me thing or i i i or how to say it i really think that that is most of it and i do not know how people i got a letter the other day and i can not remember the name of the personality that was doing it but you are sending out these things about how he can sign up to taking them right in and say do not have these kind of tv programs on anywhere where they use a preventity where they use a drinking where they use a dope and uh where they use is the vulgarity and i understand this thing about him being a her her being a him what is what is what what we are looking for right now and i have lost uh 

Recording: (4699/ 9621) 
um college wise i do not know anyone of college age that is got 

Recording: (4700/ 9621) 
i do not feel like i have gained anything from it that i did not deserve i mean 

Recording: (4701/ 9621) 
right she is won her last year 

Recording: (4702/ 9621) 
yeah uh yeah for them to go to a day yeah makes i would think it will for them to interact with the kids more yeah but where he goes there is he is got his cousins and stuff with them so 

Recording: (4703/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4704/ 9621) 
i i i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (4705/ 9621) 
i uh 

Recording: (4706/ 9621) 
oh i have to eat and that is the way 

Recording: (4707/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (4708/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4709/ 9621) 
and come back in 

Recording: (4710/ 9621) 
a little bit north of north broadway right along the freeway there did not used to be a bad neighborhood but now it is just kind of you get the little kids growing up and doing shit that you know you picture yourself going as a child one way or another you know now you throw rocks around and stuff and actually break a window right away 

Recording: (4711/ 9621) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough the oldest or something you know an instrument like that um but they they usually get enough to play a concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for the last few rehearsals so we sort of have stringers i guess you would call them yeah we have actually been on wsu is ninth got on music in mid ohio yeah we used the auto brian college choir um-hum 

Recording: (4712/ 9621) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (4713/ 9621) 
yeah well like i i played music and stuff with a lot of my friends i do not know basically just like standard teenage stuff sitting around watching tv and like i do not know just running around or whatever but like um yeah high school though i was just real like like you know you put in like a tiny little bit of effort and you get like a b and that is and that is good enough i guess 

Recording: (4714/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4715/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4716/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4717/ 9621) 
soft my year again and ended up getting married after i finished my masters 

Recording: (4718/ 9621) 
not yet i guess 

Recording: (4719/ 9621) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well uh so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting them they obviously would not know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (4720/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4721/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4722/ 9621) 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4723/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to 

Recording: (4724/ 9621) 
but it is mind boggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams you know it is just mind boggling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a handful of people and do not know anybody else like you know a lot more of a tight knit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (4725/ 9621) 
because considerably they wanted uh what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (4726/ 9621) 
well let us see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love then you know you should not do it 

Recording: (4727/ 9621) 
right well let me ask you uh about somebody else who is not that well known do you know john gorica have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is he is funny he has good songs he is a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arnold guthier or somebody i mean he he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does acoustic and uh he writes most of his own songs yeah and that if you ever see something by him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection ask to listen to it yeah it is funny funny some of the songs that really funny and some of them are the saddest things you have ever heard yeah yeah just just tragic things um uh let us see funny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows um let us see uh oh i can not think too much of them right now but uh yeah 

Recording: (4728/ 9621) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it whatnot and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always stressed back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (4729/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (4730/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4731/ 9621) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her husband was on problems and my niece is at eight well she was in fifth grade and there is a elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursed and smoking cigarettes and everything and i just am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (4732/ 9621) 
all creation into religion all of what spiritual is into one word religion you you can not uh but when you say it is a spirit of spiritual nature that is you know that is still even the door wide open that it is that is broad it is bigger than you are may uh but that uh that whole thing is um you know the people who had a some specific instructions on how to do things and i am not saying they were perfect either there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian people out there that are crooked as a dog is eye and like that is just the way to it the corrupt the money is corrupt and the lack of money is corrupt to them power has corrupt to them uh they want to be a spiritual leader why i do not know um uh to me it is an ego thing and uh this rambo go guy had some kind of buffalo uh um what do you call it a buffalo ceremony but it charges everybody native people do not do that i mean traditional native people that you you do not charge people that want to come and learn about god there is some people in california that say certain ceremony where of native thing and they buried a woman in the ground with the straw told her it is some ritual of proving and overcoming fear yet the lady was in asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw in her mouth and he could not breathe and breathe in all the sand and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows is how native american spiritual should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh spiritualally religion that is out there native american is the only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantum saying that if you have a fourth or a half 

Recording: (4733/ 9621)

Recording: (4747/ 9621) 
so uh it seems the pictures kind of hard to deal with people that are into capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they do not just seem to have such serious problems so people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into big trouble so and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked uh and we are ahead of the world there is no question about that and what the individual people persons have and how their lives go much better on the other hand um you know i am i am actually what i would like uh if it would just spread all over the world true communism

Recording: (4753/ 9621) 
he had a variety uh eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his better year uh he was taking a had taken computer class for grading period and uh it was not going well they were teaching key boarding where he learned that when he was in third grade so we were talking to the teacher about it says well he is disruptive he is supposed to be doing key boarding exercises and he is writing programs so it was and he said i knew the first day he is in here he knew everything that i was going to teach this grading period well that kind of flew up a red fly to me and can can you give him other assignments oh no he is got to do whatever else is doing so we went to the principal and i was president of the the parents advisory committee at the time so i used the access to the principal he took them out of the class immediately and put them in the library the library and worked with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet uh applications to him but the but he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us its english teacher and she is uh saturday night and he does everything he will teach so i want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was using reading books like in visible man mad element ellison ralph ellison and element i guess it is anyway um and writing papers on he is reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story that author is style and she still tested him with the other kids just to make sure she had not missed any he had not missed anything and she he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this and uh it was he loved it and that is what he needed but when we got to high school and we would talk to teachers about this and no they could not do that uh it was very frustrated it was strange 

Recording: (4754/ 9621) 
or american literature or you know anything you know 

Recording: (4755/ 9621) 
no no not at all it is not much in 

Recording: (4756/ 9621) 
uh probably going to write him again you know and uh then a lot of them i do not think are capable well in the present condition i know like but print them i am talking about there is no way in hell that he could hold down a job 

Recording: (4757/ 9621) 
yeah it is great you know and they like it they sing us on and you know interact with other kids and learn to use the library you know nowadays you know people do not go to the library as much either on the get your information off the internet or you buy books or you know it you know so i just we have felt that if we in introduce them now that hopefully this will lead on later and this way you can monitor their television we let them rent a couple movies here and there but we see what they rent or you know take out compared to uh you know the cartoon network and all these it is just cartoons just seem so worthless nowadays but actually you will watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones you know daffrey duck and the road runner and these times all it was was killed the fox you know and so we were like wow we we do not i do not know if we want to let them watch that either so yeah they are and disney and disney is pretty strong i mean you know you think of disney and you think of kids but you still a lot of the stuff they put out it is pretty hard core for a five year old or something you know a lot of the dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it is it is a violent nature so but you got to if you balance it i think you will be all right oh yeah absolutely yeah it is tough sometimes read the paper it is yeah yeah like the five year old addicted to the tarzan and he likes tarzan movie that was out so yeah oh he wants to the daughter wants to throw it away never do not have to watch that again 

Recording: (4758/ 9621) 
and it is she is kind of big chest that she is my height but the baby is like all under you do not see it i mean unless you push your shirt down 

Recording: (4759/ 9621) 
they are just not getting it right 

Recording: (4760/ 9621) 
uh i plan at this point to pursue history to the phd level uh anything of course can happen 

Recording: (4761/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4762/ 9621) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded 

Recording: (4763/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4764/ 9621) 
um yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and i just like ended up with wrong because i would have like failed everything anyway so so it um and i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like no now me and her and my other friend live in down on may and everything 

Recording: (4765/ 9621) 
sleep 

Recording: (4766/ 9621) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have uh a day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like in the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you spend the second half of the day just hanging out so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in them and it was getting and they had like we were on the front page of the american journal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought this the dogs through and they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs 

Recording: (4767/ 9621) 
they are prevented from doing much yeah yeah i yeah i just do not think that they can do much and i i i am sure it is very frustrating for them well and i know it is i we have a friend who is was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago about our age and uh it seems very different now uh you know it is she said it is scary going into the classroom sometimes uh and before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something in debt with it now you can not get back you know it 

Recording: (4768/ 9621) 
so he will not have to pay for it 

Recording: (4769/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4770/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4771/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4772/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4773/ 9621) 
oh exactly i am planning on just staying in the house if i can or whatnot yeah oh yeah yeah i know i mean we are going to get some water and whatnot because you do not know people might turn things off like you said 

Recording: (4774/ 9621) 
i wish i could work on tax 

Recording: (4775/ 9621) 
yeah and and never got any better then they got in marching band and they were in that for four years and sometimes we noticed they marching and sometimes they did not because they did not learn their music but they stayed with it and they said then they would like volunteer donna cos they did not get paid a dime for this but they did it because they enjoyed helping and definite like they go we want that student over there said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us and you over there as a b student have proved that my gosh you know you will trial for something and if you do not do well you go but i like doing it and i am going to keep with it you know and to me the straighter student who does nothing is like the kids who go to school and shoot people they have nothing in their life at all and the other one has you know activities and they are giving themselves to the community you know you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at coci and and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like easter hig hunts for that school is a grade school and it is attached to columbus alternative high school so uh you know i i read a um a uh resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the the closer she got to crying at school was when she would uh do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy and it was just they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or two was worth the candy and hit it out and they would have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says you know those are the things that were important to her and you know to me that makes you feel like you are worth something but the kids that go you know the ones that went to school i you know i do not see any community service or i do not know about i i am not a big gung ho have to be a religious person i mean i i feel i am a christian but i am not a church goer and i do not think you have to go there to be a religious person you know but uh you know i think religion and community service and feeling like you have given something to the community and you know you are just not asking continuously for it you know and and trying things and feeling at them and going okay well but i still like to play basketball i am terrible but i like to play and i can not make the team so what i do i know i will go to the y and play there you know that that is what keeps kids out of trouble and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and you know uh do the chat room stuff or the email stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those are the ones that are the big problem with children because you know mom and dad go how can i get them to do something and stay out of my hair oh i know i will buy them a nintendo i will buy them this they get i will buy them this look they are out of my way you know because you know 

Recording: (4776/ 9621) 
oh yeah fine now it comes back to your statement what do they tell us we need well no well gee we need the refrigerator you need frost free you need all these things you know what you go out on the street and see how many garage sales you have and then the ask people why would you buy them oh we thought we needed them 

Recording: (4777/ 9621) 
it is nice you have a real nice arts festival every spring you ever get a chance to go down in march 

Recording: (4778/ 9621) 
um like you said it would just be the old generations with the black president where now it would be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that would be a bigger number 

Recording: (4779/ 9621) 
they are kind of like more isolated here in profield 

Recording: (4780/ 9621) 
uh-huh i have i got a couple three applications in about the krogers and uh uh the a dish where it is a job or san angeles nursing home which i kind of like doing stuff for people with it like that you know uh i worked at a costuting at saint robb uh uh home for the aged but i had a problem dealing with a one on one basis with the older basis because they were very disvisiting you know they were not very well used to that you know they are you know you get kind of on a personal basis with them and take a couple days off them you come in and you say what happened to all she passed away i am saying oh jeez that is going to happen i told her i was bringing her a pack of cigarettes you know here you know so i mean uh yeah you get kind of a taste to to them and everything and or then they get sick sick you know and they move them up to a i used to always sit down and say you know this is the only place i have ever worked with a a move up stairs is in a promotion you know is 

Recording: (4781/ 9621)

Recording: (4782/ 9621) 
they asked me that i asked my manager the other day she told me i am supposed to do this certain thing and i asked her i said well they told me i was not supposed to 

Recording: (4783/ 9621) 
i do that every once in a while i just like when i get bored 

Recording: (4784/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4785/ 9621) 
just because uh uh women have a medicine you know and probably because that was lacking in my life um i could not focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman is voice in there but then some of the elders sat me down uh and the other thing about the swalph is men go in there in shorts women go in there in a long cotton dress you will hear people say you know and they are naked 

Recording: (4786/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4787/ 9621) 
secondant third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering that is one of the reasons they were not going to move me 

Recording: (4788/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (4789/ 9621) 
so it was one of those 

Recording: (4790/ 9621) 
no they are not it is printed at the top every on every issue that they are financially independent 

Recording: (4791/ 9621) 
is that i think i remember like if they were like reminding a few years back as i raised 

Recording: (4792/ 9621) 
no no no it is not you can do whatever you want they are uh i have heard conferences where the uh i have heard the profit talk about how you should keep in touch with people that you have served or the people that you worked with and that you knew and and that they even if they can not you can not remember how to speak just try and send them a lot and i have been been really about that so i feel a lot of pressure that i need to i mean it is it i just do not want to lose contact with them because you get these great french trips and but yeah you can there is i know people that have married people from there i mean that is really not supposed to happen while you are on your vision but when you you know when you are done if you want to go back um if that happens too but it is really not looked i mean you should not that is against the rules on the mission um if people want to get married when they get home that is fine but um yeah that is it is it is another thing where you are it is another thing where you are focus trying to focus on your work and you are not allowed to date never alone so and um but you can live where you but you can live where you serve or you can do whatever you want after you are done 

Recording: (4793/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4794/ 9621) 
in a fashion that makes it almost diametrically opposed to mine at great many times but at the same time the the free religion understanding of something 

Recording: (4795/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4796/ 9621) 
very much so 

Recording: (4797/ 9621) 
uh three years something like that hard to remember a long time ago 

Recording: (4798/ 9621) 
definitely i am such a slacker here it is great 

Recording: (4799/ 9621) 
i forget they have like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so that to me is not that is not adables and then i i so that that is one reason i would not vote for bush 

Recording: (4800/ 9621) 
right so a lot of them are already believing and that they have their own religion and they they are really faithful so that was the one of the main problems is that they um they had been so holding onto that for so long it is so strong they do not want to let go of and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and 

Recording: (4801/ 9621) 
i had enough friends who said to me can you make money with computers and i said yeah you can make money with computers and i said what could i make money with computers 

Recording: (4802/ 9621) 
i just do for the stretch it is almost like when i am laying there and and kathy is saying you know take it even though i sound speedy 

Recording: (4803/ 9621) 
not really the there were too many rules there 

Recording: (4804/ 9621) 
and then of the community fan out and they have a bigger house i like living in the old area better i like the houses and the new areas better there is one in particular that is just gorgeous 

Recording: (4805/ 9621) 
yeah i think if i make the transfer i will definitely be happy about it 

Recording: (4806/ 9621) 
you know in the sports especially i think golf 

Recording: (4807/ 9621) 
um all types i i used to work in the music industry so i do a lot of music related writing in the position i am in right now i do just a variety of travel writing and that kind of thing i concentrate primarily on editing 

Recording: (4808/ 9621) 
awful 

Recording: (4809/ 9621) 
i got good neighbors 

Recording: (4810/ 9621) 
i am not sure i mean i know no one is come to like hey you can get on this and you can get on that i mean i know my teacher she said i think it is called um abh or something and they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (4811/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4812/ 9621) 
not really yeah he is come to accept it but uh it was her decision yeah it is one thing to know that is the best thing for the baby but it is another thing my wife and i are trying to deal with mostly that we are very family oriented that this is a grandchild we will never get to see what is grow up and that is very hard on us but it says an open adoption uh they have met the couple several times uh they promise to you know send pictures and keep them updated and stuff like that so 

Recording: (4813/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4814/ 9621) 
hardly at all which i you know it is actually my family is business so um i started working there to help them out but you know as i have been working there for a while i want to move up you know so 

Recording: (4815/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (4816/ 9621) 
yeah there is a lot we need to do a lot of the volving we definitely do 

Recording: (4817/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4818/ 9621) 
well the thing i mean i know when my mom my mom has a friend that adopted 

Recording: (4819/ 9621)

Recording: (4821/ 9621) 
yeah yeah

i could not see myself doing that and you know 

Recording: (4824/ 9621) 
and you probably know that they are well they are four and i think they are four and five right now and 

Recording: (4825/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum yeah but that those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although our conductor tries hard to make it interesting for orchestra members by bringing in some music that is that is interesting challenging or whatever for orchestra he is um we are lucky to have him he is he is very good at night and i am glad that we have him as a conductor i was in the orchestra when we selected him we auditioned i think five four or five conductors over the course of the year we had each one for a different concert and we ended up picking him yeah 

Recording: (4826/ 9621) 
terrible 

Recording: (4827/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4828/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4829/ 9621) 
probably not it is a fad they are going to move along and move out of it you know so 

Recording: (4830/ 9621) 
no kind of uh you know uh it it just seems like our a society just has that you have to be just horrible to a person because they are bad well you know i know that a bad person does not become better by being bad to them 

Recording: (4831/ 9621) 
uh she is actually at uh columbia state she is going to study to be a teacher

Recording: (4833/ 9621) 
new kids the boyfriend girl from the different things they are trying behind the building you know and just the boy girl i mean just not nice no 

Recording: (4834/ 9621) 
not too much uh i was planning on i had not always planned on taking a year off but getting into the research uh like one of the things i sacrificed was looking into grad schools and applying to grad school this past year so yeah so uh i mean i i would like to go here it is one of my choices because i like the faculty and i like the program but uh i i plan to spend the next couple months well the first few months after i graduate looking at other schools 

Recording: (4835/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4836/ 9621) 
yeah she is kind of well she has all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff but as far as the carpentry work we have um this one guy that is been doing stuff for our house for a long time or 

Recording: (4837/ 9621) 
he is got his first name too 

Recording: (4838/ 9621) 
i was born in high school and i was not all that bright 

Recording: (4839/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (4840/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it is uh three hundred fifty a week for forty hours but i like the hours more than anything because it is two to ten 

Recording: (4841/ 9621) 
that is right 

Recording: (4842/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4843/ 9621) 
amazing how much the growth in delaware in different areas when i was growing up here and how mary isville was such a farm town um just the growth of the different cities and suburbs the columbus is amazing and the housing and 

Recording: (4844/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know why uh columbus has just stubborn about it until the last year uh they had not been able to get subs fifty substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well i do not know if the parents made anything about it but i guess finally you know when you have fifty percent of your classrooms covered uh they came to it and they got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it is like oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks i think a lot of the retired teachers who were not messing around with it have come back in so i do not know exactly what the yeah 

Recording: (4845/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4846/ 9621) 
and i do my job and that sometimes that basically hurts worse than because if you do your job and people know you do your job you got more people that will stick up for you without knowing it 

Recording: (4847/ 9621) 
it was like thirty dollars on like conservative coins or something and they are like i do not even know what they are doing or if you like when it is really apparent that people should not be charging this on their credit card when it is like you put in one credit card and it does not go through because it is max age and i am like no do not do that like we can not do that or you can trouble or whatever and it is just funny how you know it is real weird at at our office that um uh is it the first place that i have been to where like you clock in you know that is kind of like think of a factory like a like a punch card or something but um and just how uh like there there is this whole thing yeah like we can not wear hats and uh in the building and this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff it is just real funny to hear hear people speak like that and really believe it 

Recording: (4848/ 9621) 
he is seven months yep he is climbing on stuff and everything 

Recording: (4849/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (4850/ 9621) 
talk to them or whatever you know uh i tell people they can go there it is the vpa vietnam veteran association so people do not even know about it you know 

Recording: (4851/ 9621) 
um i have always heard and i am i am very clean anyway but you know when you have to vacuum a lot and everything and you are constantly picking up that dinner rather and just let it sit and accumulate 

Recording: (4852/ 9621) 
and and you are loving it too at least at least you try and convince yourself of it you are not 

Recording: (4853/ 9621) 
well there is um i mean i am pretty much you just keep making calls and making appointments sending out slides um it helps if you can get a you know if you know an artist who is in a gallery um it you know if you can use them as a as a reference um but that it is it is mainly just you just have to uh knock on a lot of doors and be prepared for a lot of of nose 

Recording: (4854/ 9621) 
a lot of exciting stuff going on after libraries it is not not the old you know little lady in the band yeah yeah and the web has really changed that 

Recording: (4855/ 9621) 
depends on how i store it now when i was a kid raised up we had gun locks on our guns even though i could pick them i mean 

Recording: (4856/ 9621) 
um my both of them are older my sister is like twenty seven twenty eight my brother is twenty four 

Recording: (4857/ 9621) 
the mall issue 

Recording: (4858/ 9621) 
he just looked at me like what are you talking about with it he is maz that mean when i talk to him 

Recording: (4859/ 9621) 
and let us see my my youngest son is wife is a teacher in the catholic schools elementary schools and my my second son is wife works for the columbia school system as a secretary and uh actually transcribing notes for people for men who have are reading books or papers or whatever 

Recording: (4860/ 9621) 
when i would run away from foster huh 

Recording: (4861/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4862/ 9621) 
i think they should be i think they should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny that that uh federal couples are you know with home visits and and economic tests and all these kind of things but um the gay people i know uh the ones that would that would wanna be parents i think would make great parents 

Recording: (4863/ 9621) 
um i think just having like uh such a low cost really helps 

Recording: (4864/ 9621) 
people can not understand 

Recording: (4865/ 9621) 
games i do not know we we vary it from one way to an next 

Recording: (4866/ 9621) 
she was the rudeest woman 

Recording: (4867/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4868/ 9621) 
so family um familiarity and um just a community i think is going up and up um traffic is around as with the ones but i mean you need to go through that right now because columbus is spending so much that we need the orangees and um i guess they like a publicity nationally i i we do not have you know like the national football teams and now with the hockey coming i i think we are getting more recognition but when people talk about columbus they said i do not think they know of columbus ohio or columbus georgia columbuswhere right 

Recording: (4869/ 9621) 
not doing anything my son uh you know with his disorder he would constantly be uh late for school and i uh called the school and told them this was in high school 

Recording: (4870/ 9621) 
yeah ooh and um um you know at the time i was like i am not going to get anything in this and it was misery and what not but i have met people that have been in much worse situations and at least i can kind of relate to them 

Recording: (4871/ 9621) 
just to make it easier on everybody 

Recording: (4872/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4873/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (4874/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (4875/ 9621) 
yeah my dogs are home 

Recording: (4876/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4877/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (4878/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4879/ 9621) 
some of the really hard questions um why bad things happen to good people people can not people can not just accept that that bad things happen to good people they want to know why i do not know why i am not i i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my with my god but we are not on you know we are not on a conversation though i am on the side of the table yeah and that is the table why did this happen he is not he does not see fit to tell me why something happens unless it pertains to me um let us see what is another really hard one um one of the biggest ones with people my age is the is um apologetics uh very apologetic which is going out and saying your center except christ everybody on this campus has heard of brother jet he runs around camp he runs around on the over going you know flat horror and yeah de yeah de and that is just i mean there are a lot of there are a lot of people within the community of of christians who can not stand that we do not like what he is doing because yeah i am one of them because we have to go back anyone who is been influenced by him we have to go back and we have to undo all the damage he is done before we can really start in on them and and and helping them to understand what we are trying to tell them we have to undo what brother jet has done because he is just i mean yeah maybe his heart is in the right place but he is doing it the wrong way but um one of the big things is right after you are done doing all of the spiel about you know why you think they should accept christ in their life they say okay that is good for you and that is the general that is the general feeling among people our age our generation i mean what generation are we anyways i am i am twenty so there is like the generation x there the generation right after me and there is generation y two k their generation right before me so we are stuck right in the middle i do not even think we have a generation 

Recording: (4880/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4881/ 9621) 
yeah it is uh that it is on all in tangy down there north of there 

Recording: (4882/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4883/ 9621) 
right down 

Recording: (4884/ 9621) 
where i do not think that there is any question they could look right down our throats because and anyway we fired a a couple of times from there they started firing back at us and man scared me 

Recording: (4885/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4886/ 9621) 
i think that influences how everybody becomes not only the kids the adults too 

Recording: (4887/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4888/ 9621) 
yeah he is like that 

Recording: (4889/ 9621) 
yeah i would be at least thirty maybe like getting up towards forty before i have the experience really necessary to get in a good job but i do not wanna be i mean like my uh venturing crew advisors is thirty eight and retired i mean i am i am going more for their 

Recording: (4890/ 9621) 
because they like it they like school and that is why they came to college football was secondary 

Recording: (4891/ 9621) 
uh well the problem is is uh like say every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their businessmen there at eight a m well an airport has so many runways and so many taxed a ways and you know like say ten airplanes every ten minutes can come in and out of those airports well they end up shooting like thirty there so instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there at home while they are you know shooting them in what they do is they will like uh say going to oh here they will you have to call for release times to these different airports and they will say well he can not go right now but he can go like at twenty seven past the hour so he they know by looking at the tire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport when he will fit in so it is not so much air traffic delays it is airlines that cause it themselves it is like uh you know like you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room uh ten oclock today well rather than say why do not some of you come at ten and another group come at ten fifteen and another group they were all trying to do the same thing at once and it does not work you know you you can not get you can not get so many people through that door and if you say well i am going to take five at a time well they can get in but if you say i am taking five hundred at a time it does not work and so the airplane airlines always go well it is the government and regulations and blah blah blah that is why we are delayed and it is really them themselves because they are 

Recording: (4892/ 9621) 
i mean you talk to people in the catholic church about the unscene meaning the spiritual realm and they freak out 

Recording: (4893/ 9621) 
um well if you have that bottle that for he will wake maybe up around six or seven i normally wake up at six anyway so it does not matter so i am ready for him then 

Recording: (4894/ 9621) 
have to go to bed so early 

Recording: (4895/ 9621) 
she was a cowboy and he was an indian 

Recording: (4896/ 9621) 
fortunately we were out we were not in the country so we did not notice it we had just 

Recording: (4897/ 9621) 
it was not so much of a hate thing it was just more easier to people i like to hang out with if you do not like to that is fine 

Recording: (4898/ 9621) 
i i do 

Recording: (4899/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (4900/ 9621) 
to make me healthy or whatever because i have always been really healthy 

Recording: (4901/ 9621) 
okay well i am not adopting that real and fortunately the judge of our game is at listen to our conversation so i feel kind of safe a mutual friend a much better friend of mine than of hers but she is more attractive than i am so we figured it all balanced out we decided that made him unbiased 

Recording: (4902/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4903/ 9621) 
i do not really go over to the east side very uh very often you know sometimes we go over you know in high school drive on the other you know or something like that but um i do not i do not know as far as i do not really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i do not know if it is the media that you know kind of portrays those or more than there used to be um i know that when i was younger i was allowed to to do a lot more things uh by myself like to to go places on the bus and and those types of things and then my family is allowed to do now 

Recording: (4904/ 9621) 
i do not know yeah so it is kind of like i am for education in schools but um just like the bad things about it you know sex can do you can get pregnant number one 

Recording: (4905/ 9621) 
personally 

Recording: (4906/ 9621) 
really oh my god and then you can have to mark them if you want to we did not but you could and we had two people who who um said you are kidding and i said never mind i am sorry for telling you i never even said that and i was like wow somebody must have done this before because everybody all just like there is no other response but 

Recording: (4907/ 9621) 
he 

Recording: (4908/ 9621) 
uh well i am very much my my base line philosophy is though shelt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh being a vegetarian and uh um and uh most of our wars i would have said no let us not do this yet although on the other hand i i have to admit that there has been some stuff that we have not been able to stop without it uh and and that is too bad you know that things are have been that bad in some like a world war two i mean we did not really have any choice there and not to but uh some of the some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh so but you know you can get you can get a philosophy but it does not always apply every single case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the the guy that they uh uh executed here in ohio last fall did you know about it you 

Recording: (4909/ 9621) 
that is that is what i would i would think in that case i mean i mean because the dominant culture i mean is always going to be accessible to them 

Recording: (4910/ 9621) 
yeah but if you were the first day at the indians to do it it it will cost you millions and millions and it would be rough it would be so hard to 

Recording: (4911/ 9621) 
yeah but if you if the if it is somebody in the eye obviously it is going to hurt him but you know most 

Recording: (4912/ 9621) 
for everybody so you you want to go to ivy league you do not even want to look here 

Recording: (4913/ 9621) 
it almost would be better if they let the dog go over because you know she is going to bring in mud and grass and it is not going to be perfect maybe knock something over you know kind of start with her but you have to go home you know what i mean 

Recording: (4914/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (4915/ 9621) 
but i do not know 

Recording: (4916/ 9621) 
um not really he i mean he obviously went to church too for at least a few years uh while their my parents are still together but i mean since then i mean there is really nothing about it 

Recording: (4917/ 9621) 
yeah it is to change a pace and plus being around my sister instead of you know taking the twenty mile leg all the way up there just go a couple of blocks over and there she is 

Recording: (4918/ 9621) 
really what did he tell you 

Recording: (4919/ 9621) 
and um so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church tacked on and we they asked the choir for input 

Recording: (4920/ 9621) 
no it was pretty it was more black than white tell you truth or it might have been even but now it is more black than white definitely now because i i live in a neighborhood where it is it is mostly black then white and that is where i have always lived in my whole life 

Recording: (4921/ 9621) 
it is like it is um it is like there is fires and stuff that you see or whatever and um and you get directions to it and it will be in a you know there is a a bunch of different places will be in you know like a sports arena or something or or it depends how big they are i mean there is ones where there is like two hundred people there is ones where like five there is ones where they are a thousand there is ones where that are like three thousand and like there is ones in canada that i did not i did not go to one but some of my friends went to where there is like fifteen thousand people there or something like that 

Recording: (4922/ 9621) 
and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy and it is like um my my oldest girl she we are expecting our first grandchild here within a couple of weeks and she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her and um it is not that these girls are not independent and can not do it on their they are megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was twelve i mean she was just very very mature very driven the only problem she has she did not have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself but she chooses to be still at home and be a part of her life and um my son he is both those kids have four points i mean they really were cardin school because they know it is important and my son was uh he was the only only one that was in seventh and eighth grade he took that time to do the matureing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i am really lucky that we had our difficulty at that point and uh and it was minimal but to me having been used to everything being perfect you know it is like it was like for him to have um 

Recording: (4923/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4924/ 9621) 
grand children um-hum yeah 

Recording: (4925/ 9621) 
and um and then i my family moved to clinton valley and kind of lived up there 

Recording: (4926/ 9621) 
yeah different there is there is only so much town so that they lose it 

Recording: (4927/ 9621) 
which but with the purpose of these books i suppose 

Recording: (4928/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (4929/ 9621) 
and i was crying the whole time just that little pain my mom was laughing at me it was not funny and and to what they left out parts you know if you talk to people when they have babies and they oh it is the worst pain but you will forget about it they left out that whole part where they put the epedro and you and you you 

Recording: (4930/ 9621) 
oh yeah but he has to still support the union so yeah that is that is a rough place to be in but uh does the union like when people go on strike does the union help support the people that are not getting paid then or 

Recording: (4931/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4932/ 9621) 
right yeah 

Recording: (4933/ 9621) 
oh right 

Recording: (4934/ 9621) 
and then when you do not take it easy 

Recording: (4935/ 9621) 
very big differences stuck together on a small ship they just glossed over those and it became just like the next generation except for the they did not talk to the federation as much anymore so i did not like that one so much but 

Recording: (4936/ 9621) 
she is an electrical engineer yeah um he started off here in columbia that she had not really went out of business then he went to or bana for grand terre space and um they ended up merging and now there is really no aerosplace things in columbus ohio so he is working for um plain city which is um uh kind of heating and cooling air conditioning systems and so he is using the air flow to sign 

Recording: (4937/ 9621) 
and anyone you come across could be getting i do not know i guess weird ideas of your kids or whatever 

Recording: (4938/ 9621) 
uh invited to come down and be saved 

Recording: (4939/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4940/ 9621) 
some of them are all the above and uh some of them are not now there is quite a few of them that have adjusted well to society uh when it came home biggest thing i think when uh what what happened is that there was not any joy about uh like world war two and korea and everything you know it was like you came off go off the plane and you know nobody really cared yeah 

Recording: (4941/ 9621) 
that is a rule coming down hand down 

Recording: (4942/ 9621) 
yeah where the trees were mature and they did not really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees so 

Recording: (4943/ 9621) 
i told her well that is just my identification there you look on my license and nobody can copy that you see where the a unm is my last name 

Recording: (4944/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (4945/ 9621) 
i am glad i ended up to do dinner fine i uh some people would be really nice um and other people would just be unbelievable here it is so funny um but now i do this this uh work at this place called i work there with works there too so i mean worked at my time i am working place too with me so it makes it bearable i i like it just because i worked there for a while before she did and it was just it was really annoying like um but both places there is cubicles you know and that is really weird too um cubicles are uh all that develops 

Recording: (4946/ 9621) 
four four years ago i do not know it is been a while four and a half years ago something like that 

Recording: (4947/ 9621) 
very well and you know her vocabulary is limited and she did not know how to spell or know any bigger words so i tried to sit her down and you know give her a little refresher and you know come from a new jersey public school and doing a study then you know couple of these different places you never even hear of like i do not know how how kentucky or wherever you want to you know some small town would have this great teaching

Recording: (4950/ 9621) 
okay not it was better before there that is better that is okay let us try that 

Recording: (4951/ 9621) 
just go see what you went and use this paper today because we are going to review for the test and then at the end of the period when the kids are leaving and give johnny a copy of it the back copy would you do that for me well the girls usually write neither and they usually get a girl that does not have a learning disability they usually get everything down off the board whereas the boys will get a little distracted or they will you know maybe not they do not tend to sit up front they will sit in the back so they can you know grab their friend with the pencil and throw the paper wads and stuff 

Recording: (4952/ 9621) 
yeah he is teaching us uh system five just funny 

Recording: (4953/ 9621) 
but here it is just to see you know how much success you can have and then they just want to leave but we we can look forward to the basketball season i think he is a good coach 

Recording: (4954/ 9621) 
bugs to room 

Recording: (4955/ 9621) 
i went to private schools for a long time 

Recording: (4956/ 9621) 
because i would have got my house well 

Recording: (4957/ 9621) 
it is a lot of money 

Recording: (4958/ 9621) 
nobody ever you know what they want me to do is put him on a relative and i did not like him on a relative i did not like what it did to him 

Recording: (4959/ 9621) 
right and just going over it and over it and over it 

Recording: (4960/ 9621) 
but uh the the first routine i took was our uh it comes in so better at that time that let us get the hell out of here 

Recording: (4961/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4962/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (4963/ 9621) 
no i do not 

Recording: (4964/ 9621) 
it was it was supposedly it was my job but as you know the parents always get stuck i have a brother 

Recording: (4965/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (4966/ 9621) 
and that is not alive 

Recording: (4967/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4968/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4969/ 9621) 
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up you know uh a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done they were not doing fall on pro to call and of course me i would be the one saying hey you are not falling on pro to call and they would say well you know i am i am a former addict i am allowed to do that 

Recording: (4970/ 9621) 
it is just challenge to figure out how to make something work or how to i i am just incredibly optimistic i mean i really feel like um whatever happens to me i really it is it is my responsibility to you know help it happen take care of it deal with it you know i am i always have a backup plan 

Recording: (4971/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (4972/ 9621) 
so you know downstairs there is five different sectors so they split the uh area up into five different areas and uh you know there are some sectors down there that get extremely busy and then sometimes it is just like you know you are just twilling your thumb it is it is like fielder vanman you know it is not like steady like if you are working at myer running the cash register it is just kind of like steady it is like you look at you know you it would be like sitting at my own there is no one in your line and then you turn your back and turn back around and there is like seventy five 

Recording: (4973/ 9621) 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like the design um maybe the designer but you know like i went to uh i i was in police uh uh law enforcement 

Recording: (4974/ 9621) 
what 

Recording: (4975/ 9621) 
and the people that would be decent parent are not because of the situations and whatnot um just my nobody in my family my sister does not have kids i do not have kids where in her mid to late thirties um our friends just had one um i do have some friends that have like more than one which is great because they are just great parents i know those kids are going to be going in but then i have uh other people that like my other friends that just had one were trying to help a a child in children services that came from poor 

Recording: (4976/ 9621) 
yeah they gave us nine dollars a day like nine twenty five for what meal plan i was on so then um we bought like pop starts and that lasted for like a week of breakfast 

Recording: (4977/ 9621) 
stop yeah those are real chemicals 

Recording: (4978/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (4979/ 9621) 
so this is my first one like an doggy 

Recording: (4980/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4981/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (4982/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (4983/ 9621) 
so there is there is no faulting the the folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative and responsible to say that experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately finally you know never mind pretend i never said that 

Recording: (4984/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (4985/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4986/ 9621) 
yeah there were there were both there were there were uh white skinheads at our school you know that were races against me for hanging around black people um i did not really have i guess uh there i am sure there was black people that were racist too but i did not you know not in school i did not have problems really 

Recording: (4987/ 9621) 
yeah i actually have a bunch of numbers here that i hope i did not lose yeah i got uh three people to call see about jobs there should be in within the middle of the week yeah because gas money is i can do construction cooking actually took columbus public schools cooking tests and passed it so i am technically a cook 

Recording: (4988/ 9621) 
right but how old is your kid 

Recording: (4989/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4990/ 9621) 
uh neither one of them is married or had any kids uh my sister does have a boyfriend for probably like three years or so and there is talk about uh like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 

Recording: (4991/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (4992/ 9621) 
that is cool 

Recording: (4993/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4994/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4995/ 9621) 
like management here 

Recording: (4996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (4997/ 9621) 
how would you live up in ohio 

Recording: (4998/ 9621) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (4999/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (5000/ 9621) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well but you know does i mean i it seems you know from what i have read it if you wanted to make a bomb it is fairly uncomplicated you know so 

Recording: (5001/ 9621) 
that is right and in other words there is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5002/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5003/ 9621) 
yeah it does not it is not like a skilled profession to me i think 

Recording: (5004/ 9621) 
see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like the the europeans do i think i guess because the europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they get the trains that the european trains and the buses and and and and just like the just by personal car you can go you know across just going across the border you can think of visit uh you know countries like like it is so condensed but here it is like we have got our oceans and it is like we got a like life so so i i think that is why i like i think europeans are a much more cooler in that respect there is a much more cosmopolitan just because they they they it is like it is no big deal for for like somebody and you have to speak like seven languages or here it is like you know you get somebody over here who who can actually who actually knows english you know he is like so that that is i think that is i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5005/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5006/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5007/ 9621) 
yeah i think it is further east and where i i was right in the year old mountains so it is like the border of europe and 

Recording: (5008/ 9621) 
so they are close but i try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who is uh a nice terribly everything dealers are all nice and sweet and stuff but do not have enough rewarding characteristics to make me wanna spend lots of time around them 

Recording: (5009/ 9621) 
it is and it was world war two that brought them together um my my dad was uh in the at the end of the war he was in the army air corps he never had to go overseas but he was stationed in louisiana 

Recording: (5010/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5011/ 9621) 
not so much old star trek uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean you back when it was new i liked the next generation but once deep space nine came out and had a gritter darker story that was not so cookie cutter in fashion there was uh a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad people the the characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that i do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i thought as something that would be even grittinger they they had the potential for for excellent intercharacter conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season um and that really bothered me and then it ultimately this story like they are trapped but they do not really pursue like the issues of being separated from home and two factions that had 

Recording: (5012/ 9621) 
they settled on springfield ohio and then my mom met my father um he was from petasco they met here at oh well she was there going to college and they settled here in columbus 

Recording: (5013/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5014/ 9621) 
yeah she says something about uh you are sure you are not a football player or something you know you got that that that is significant signature there going and 

Recording: (5015/ 9621) 
and i would definitely keep an eye out and you know figure out what is going on you know 

Recording: (5016/ 9621) 
you hang out like i do not know it is more like a like a suburban town as opposed to like a centralized downtown yeah it is just like you know like a half an hour i i or i mean twenty minutes outside you know you can get the double under fifteen minutes the double under something like that and i mean that is still like a part of of columbus as opposed toyeah yeah 

Recording: (5017/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5018/ 9621) 
yeah they have uh well okay they do have sales tax but it is added into the price before so you are not sitting there trying to figure out what it is 

Recording: (5019/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5021/ 9621) 
right and you know the all the babies in the hospital be covered under my son is insurance and she is covered under her father is insurance so their medical expenses are not very very big 

Recording: (5022/ 9621) 
yeah you go to you go to class in one building and you go across the yard to another and then you go to lunch and then you come across another and you are locking and all that stuff just like a mini campus 

Recording: (5023/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5024/ 9621) 
so i do not know she likes it 

Recording: (5025/ 9621) 
yeah man i want to be over in the next county you know driving in the middle of the sky going yeah a couple of people down there floating around under 

Recording: (5026/ 9621) 
and it is a very it seems to be a fairly conservative uh university as well so 

Recording: (5027/ 9621) 
i mean not that i i do not want to be on welfare it is like it is like a a down when i want to go up you know 

Recording: (5028/ 9621) 
uh uh well actually when i was at a high state i worked for the newspaper 

Recording: (5029/ 9621) 
how would you do this to me 

Recording: (5030/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5031/ 9621) 
but that is because i am not home a lot and like i said my wife is here now her mom is just moved to texas so she is living down in texas and she is got brothers and sisters all over the united states 

Recording: (5032/ 9621) 
um it is probably what we were i mean actually just waiting for my last experiment i heard a couple of people were talking about it they were talking about it 

Recording: (5033/ 9621) 
not this job no 

Recording: (5034/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5035/ 9621) 
they and that is it they have not had a challenge you need to have a challenge as to put to you every day every day because they have more meaningfulness in the so that with you put your head down at night or something like that i am thankful what i did i am still coming to you i need more help tomorrow because without something intangible is going to be a motivation factor so what is going to give you a drill and a get up tomorrow morning and say hey i am going to do a better job today than it is yesterday but when we as a society say oh gee he is struggled you say well let us lower this thing in let us lower the bar a little more or you know gosh darn hey scurney he did not make that last shot last night a uh a time out let us get scurney two or men is and let us live in my mother and shoot he got two or men is tragged 

Recording: (5036/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5037/ 9621) 
i do not know uh and i do not and for awhile we got to stop the thing that is uh confusing to me is that sometimes we will get something stopped for twenty five or thirty years or ten or fifteen and then we go back it is like hey we got moved ourselves out of that why are we going back to it now uh and and i think you know that papers keep saying that our uh crime rate is going down and everything and so uh i think that is because we some people are you know trying to make it deal with these people as people who are ill or sick and try to help them with their you know it took us a long time to figure out that alcohol is a is a disease okay and it is so now we try to help alcoholics well uh certainly murdering is a 

Recording: (5038/ 9621) 
no this all started long before that actually just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yes the baby is going to be born i i think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time but i think it is all for your help is now uh and she is she is great 

Recording: (5039/ 9621)

Recording: (5043/ 9621) 
yeah they went and won the super bowl and they went back and lost the super bowl so 

Recording: (5044/ 9621) 
you know the uh i mean my personally i personally would not care you know as long as uh if i was in a box or somebody i could care less whether he would care or not you know as long as he would shoot a gun you know they would help me out if i was in trouble so 

Recording: (5045/ 9621) 
no i i do not want to like i do not want to spend like i just want to like i am trying to do different things like like if uh most music i listen to is like drum and base where it is like peace lines and like 

Recording: (5046/ 9621) 
if they have someone who gets a grant who is already planning to go to their school so um

Recording: (5051/ 9621) 
and not all of them or or vietnam buts either you know 

Recording: (5052/ 9621) 
no asking each other opinions or anything like that 

Recording: (5053/ 9621) 
it would be a lot more accepted i think here even though it might be kind of i would not do that on my own but if i am i felt like that was what i was doing all the time so i had full time 

Recording: (5054/ 9621) 
thinks i do not feel like a grandma either so i have to be careful what i do they still watch me i guess 

Recording: (5055/ 9621) 
oh yeah and you know they are like three fifty for a pack of cards you do not even get gum like we used to with the baseball cards you know yeah you get yeah i know five six cards for three fifty and out of the like jeez the count every time you go to the store they got them all in the check out like now they have done the first hundred and fifty they are moving on to series two you know so they uh oh they are they are killing them they really are 

Recording: (5056/ 9621) 
i see uh 

Recording: (5057/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5058/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5059/ 9621) 
and you learn what you have to do to get through the test course i did that when i was here at school 

Recording: (5060/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (5061/ 9621) 
that is sad 

Recording: (5062/ 9621) 
can not i can not believe it at all i i you know i i i just blows my mind you can spend all thousands of dollars and have it just for a wedding 

Recording: (5063/ 9621) 
he is seven months 

Recording: (5064/ 9621) 
he will pour all the water that is left in that bucket and he will do it in a way that just brings that heat out that steam and that breath that sacred breath is what we caught 

Recording: (5065/ 9621) 
that is right 

Recording: (5066/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5067/ 9621) 
it seems that way i do not know why that is you know in the eighties they had a lot of games were like one to two you know it was shut out and stuff like that now i mean my room was telling me the yankees beat someone twenty one to something the other day 

Recording: (5068/ 9621) 
uh-huh and the wrong atmosphere it was just was not the right time and uh it just i had money and i i had i got like uh a settlement like thirty cents a dollar not a settlement but when i sold my stocks and everything i got like thirty cents thousand dollars and put about five thousand here five thousand here still had twenty you know started a business and money was coming in and uh and using the money for the using the money for other is saying can not realize that they supposed to be putting that money back in a business you know but as running around with a bunch of other people that basically were doing the same thing you know so 

Recording: (5069/ 9621) 
yeah okay 

Recording: (5070/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5071/ 9621) 
he is just sitting there okay that is not normal and he comes home you are talking to him yeah it is not like you are here to talk to him 

Recording: (5072/ 9621) 
when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and most the cops in the neighborhood knew i carried a gun 

Recording: (5073/ 9621) 
and basically they were a three weeks long they are about four and a half hours the first one was really long you know jay said last night was not so bad though i mean the first one was a lot of lot of information classroom kind of stuff but he did well he was much he is just so sweet he is just wonderful he was much more interactive than than a lot of the other guys were just kind of you know they would sit there and they were not breathing and they were kind of rolling their eyes and i just think god you budget a bunch you know it is going to come down to it you know and and you are going to be so awful and he is just real supportive and and just he is just traffic so it makes it does it makes him better 

Recording: (5074/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (5075/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5076/ 9621) 
so how many years did you actually were there teaching three years wow 

Recording: (5077/ 9621)

Recording: (5079/ 9621) 
not usually fifty two car deck cards but other interesting types of cards 

Recording: (5080/ 9621) 
yeah i would she was like a a community ligays on uh with her corporation so i was a supervisor on my job and sometimes i would have very very difficult uh clients that i needed advice from her on how to you know go about working with them and uh i would call her and she would um it would just be really rude not helpful 

Recording: (5081/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5082/ 9621) 
yeah it is and it seems to me that they do not keep the very very best of the kids in state but it gets a lot of the like just below the absolute best and it keeps a lot of them here 

Recording: (5083/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5084/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5085/ 9621) 
yeah they they 

Recording: (5086/ 9621) 
yeah i have two older brothers one is ten years older the other one is fifteen years older 

Recording: (5087/ 9621) 
yeah we met um at where we there is a single is word where we call work it is on twelfth avenue down here and it is just where all the single people under thirty go to church and there is dances and different activities and 

Recording: (5088/ 9621) 
um i am signed up for architecture right now which i like architecture but i think there is probably more time into it than i am ready to actually commit into it 

Recording: (5089/ 9621) 
yeah uh i like baseball i used to like that a lot better when i was younger but no i do not i would not take the time to sit and watch the whole baseball game on the tv 

Recording: (5090/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5091/ 9621) 
i mean my oh my sister said if you did not leave him i was going to slap over your hair to the wall because she was joke she was not kidding though because you know it is just one of the oh i can help him you know i have learned on the caretaker like i roll my eyes because it is like you can not change people that much stupid but um it is weird because it was terrible but because he was real controlling and you know you start to doubt yourself like did i say that right and like you would not let me sleep so then you start to lose that you know what i mean really you really do start to lose your mental 

Recording: (5092/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5093/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5094/ 9621) 
i know i um i can not wait because i the house we live in it is a half double when we had a front porch and a deck which i really decked out but you know i have like eighty plants in my house now but i just can not wait to have my own space i never plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i am going to leave you know and 

Recording: (5095/ 9621) 
we 

Recording: (5096/ 9621) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before it just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (5097/ 9621) 
if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but you know in in election times a weekend is a couple of centuries uh a year is not eon you know so anything that happened between now and then but i think adult had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate um which is basically where clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in um most real democrats the war invading of the world and many you know congressmen and and senators dislike clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough um i like clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either party do not get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a modern and can can appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to to put together a school that be campaign that basically you had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty percent of the people who were were for you with the yes votes thirty percent who are automatically against you the no votes and thirty percent in between i told them ignore the no votes you know just just do not get them upset with you you do not want them you know working actively against you lock up your your thirty better with you make sure you know you do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had them a zoge them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dole could have done i am not sure if george w is going to be able to uh because to get the the nomination eventually he is going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am antiaborian i am pro gun he is already said the pro gun and that is going against what most americans are saying dole i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls um so you know you have to find a way to to moderate that stance uh whether you are republican or democrat 

Recording: (5098/ 9621) 
yeah if i had um if i had stayed for the i i did not graduate so if i would stayed for the fourth year um when we did a lot we would do a lot of um uh uh making up a port port fully of that kind of thing um i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i i would have i probably would have stayed but it was 

Recording: (5099/ 9621) 
so i can just talk normal and it will not be too loud because i talk loud 

Recording: (5100/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5101/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5102/ 9621) 
uh-huh uh-huh 

Recording: (5103/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5104/ 9621) 
so and he 

Recording: (5105/ 9621) 
that is how i would like them to be 

Recording: (5106/ 9621) 
there did not use to be an expensive restaurants and everything and now it is such a open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um body is taste you know i mean before no i would have to go into a restaurant and to salad and bake potato or you know i mean there was nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the food is so cooked out i mean honestly you know it is like no nutritionable value 

Recording: (5107/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5108/ 9621) 
i like i know one of the poisons using it is like rap poison or something like that i mean just obviously the idea of putting rap poison into you when it is meant to kill a rat obviously seems pretty dangerous 

Recording: (5109/ 9621) 
all right very good 

Recording: (5110/ 9621) 
he has different levels of things that people need at different ages and things like that and you know and and at at forty you you think wow you know and you really need to make a difference or do something and and i can see that because i have gone through all the phases that he is talking about so 

Recording: (5111/ 9621) 
i mean not say a few words for a plus thirty he would say anything get out of here 

Recording: (5112/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5113/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5114/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5115/ 9621) 
we like to i do i like to cook i enjoy cooking 

Recording: (5116/ 9621) 
you know what are you going to do you hit that kid you are going to jail 

Recording: (5117/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5118/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5119/ 9621) 
yeah i think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area um i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now is since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know i am more aware of what is going on and i really um am going to be some kind of activist for um i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman is clubs and things like that i just i think that is going to be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there is one off of uh basketball or no it is off of henderson coots and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i could not even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so i think it really affects it yeah try to go around yeah and until they make a women is club so we will not be real equal yeah 

Recording: (5120/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5121/ 9621) 
but they are uh because they are both government programs but yeah but i think like i said for the for the younger people because it is uh because it is not their fault their parents can not get health health care so 

Recording: (5122/ 9621) 
no it happened quite a few times and that i mean i also chewed on him too you know we both did it but um it once i had my son 

Recording: (5123/ 9621) 
so you have how many gets 

Recording: (5124/ 9621) 
and we have been very happy with the uh wessie day care i do not know if you have any association with it but oh it is it is just unbelievable our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade and uh i mean when she got out of that day care she could read she could write she could do computer you know you know it is an education it is not you know people you pay for it it is well you are hires but you know higher amount of money for 

Recording: (5125/ 9621) 
once you are in it you are you have been in it and that is it i have thirty two points 

Recording: (5126/ 9621) 
yeah it uh you are right 

Recording: (5127/ 9621) 
that is all right okay 

Recording: (5128/ 9621) 
it felt innocent to me and i like that um because all the other times where they have started to kiss it is always been like stereotyic romantic and that is like wow two friends alone it is new years perfect you know it was not it was not like they were going to jump in the sack or anything like that 

Recording: (5129/ 9621) 
really i do not know i mean i guess for me i i just i just amazed when i get along so well you know and and we have been together for about two years and i mean i i do not know i just i do i just i just really like them i do not in ten years from now but it certainly there is a lot of things that that our family is very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about different things and and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and um his name was a station too but he he drives a lot 

Recording: (5130/ 9621) 
true 

Recording: (5131/ 9621) 
oh really that is cute 

Recording: (5132/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5133/ 9621) 
i got a lot of respect for college kids the majority of them it is it is other people do not have respect for 

Recording: (5134/ 9621) 
they had three uh 

Recording: (5135/ 9621) 
and oh she is stepping she is pregnant back off you know it is like 

Recording: (5136/ 9621) 
oh no and it turns out it was the the uh the facedless alien set a trap for the for the guys and i did not like the way it was resolved but i liked the fact that it was not resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about samantha uh 

Recording: (5137/ 9621) 
it is not it is not because i i see where he is and he is really messed up and i i can not do anything for him but i have you know i have i am open to a relationship with them 

Recording: (5138/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5139/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5140/ 9621) 
you walk in oh my like oh my gosh 

Recording: (5141/ 9621) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a lot seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday school starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but yeah 

Recording: (5142/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5143/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5144/ 9621) 
well and i think it really it still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy you know would i act this way would that make my mom because until you are about five or four your parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know that oh and they learned by watching you do it too i mean my son now uh let us see it was fifteen maybe he would run across the street when martha the eighty six year old lady across the street was trying to bring her garbage down he would seen me do that he go oh let me get that forty marza she is got arthritis she looked like she is going to fall she takes steps about this big and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (5145/ 9621) 
you know with limited money and i live in a nice neighborhood i have lived there for eleven years i have never had any trouble whatsoever and uh the bus is right there and you know the only thing that bothers me is if i want to you know go to a grocery store i got to go you know over to high street you know to clintonville you know to the big bear 

Recording: (5146/ 9621) 
yeah you are always still going to have a house like when we were kids like me and you would meet we would get in a fight and then after that we would be best friends now you know i would be walking down the street and you know a fourteen year old scared me to death right now 

Recording: (5147/ 9621) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the library is connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out into the public working the public seeing to it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the way uh you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before and now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just wants to connect to us 

Recording: (5148/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i was actually looking at that rise in the military and they started popping up all this abuse stuff and i was like man darn it i think my aunt 

Recording: (5149/ 9621) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know a pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out there are some of being worried about uh uh a a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it about it so yeah but you know i it is i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (5150/ 9621) 
well this has been you 

Recording: (5151/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5152/ 9621) 
i start at the real bottom of it 

Recording: (5153/ 9621) 
yeah i gave him to my sister and my mom and stuff like that so 

Recording: (5154/ 9621) 
yeah it is uh had a little give him now 

Recording: (5155/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5156/ 9621) 
so southern russia it is the uh near um like kazak and i mean not really near but relatively it is not close to moscow 

Recording: (5157/ 9621) 
she did but we were out 

Recording: (5158/ 9621) 
um aeros space industry my dad uh had a degree in um engineering uh uh what kind of engineering drafting engineering i think and um worked for in california and they asked them to move to the north american plant here in columbus out near the airport when it was north american before it became rock well and uh that is why we moved here and that is why i grew up on the side because it was close to there and uh and when i was one year old we took a car trip across the country so i do not remember much of it but that is how we moved 

Recording: (5159/ 9621) 
uh so now i am independent without the only influence 

Recording: (5160/ 9621) 
right even though it is a unanimous object it all kind of came together 

Recording: (5161/ 9621) 
right there you are over 

Recording: (5162/ 9621) 
then so i give her most credit for 

Recording: (5163/ 9621) 
drink around the world oh boy 

Recording: (5164/ 9621) 
saturday i think it was 

Recording: (5165/ 9621) 
not so much when i was teaching it because i think 

Recording: (5166/ 9621) 
you know and i would not be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here 

Recording: (5167/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5168/ 9621) 
he can aggravate him i mean you get to be older you know this some of those issues can be very aggravating 

Recording: (5169/ 9621) 
because they are they have enough money to buy new things and they do not want to necessarily send it down i do not think to the salvation army or the i i do not know but i think that they think that there is a better way of giving away and like good will they resell and salvation army they resell well we we 

Recording: (5170/ 9621) 
um no which is very grateful he did like go pass my parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though it is public records like who owns the house um luckily we have not had that because we purchased the house my husband and i before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maintenance on it but uh no luckily 

Recording: (5171/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5172/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5173/ 9621) 
i am the one that is eventually going to get in trouble 

Recording: (5174/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5175/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5176/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5177/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5178/ 9621) 
yeah but and i think i i am a firm believer that uh little subtleies like that to yourself are much better than looking in the mirror and going look at them whoops and you go this way and you go i am getting a gut and you know it is like that is so negative to your would you tell your mom that you know 

Recording: (5179/ 9621) 
well we believe that um that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again in through joe smith because he had a desire and it is hard to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw god and jesus christ and i know this is all really i mean this is like deep doctor and stuff but and um and he was told that there were not none of the churches on the earth were true that and some of them had good things but they they are um they were not exactly hitting the 

Recording: (5180/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (5181/ 9621)

Recording: (5186/ 9621) 
you know every time you they ask him a question like it is been scripted it is over and over and um he does not seem like he is real bright 

Recording: (5187/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5188/ 9621)

so we walked across the street to the church 

Recording: (5192/ 9621) 
above it and periodically they would have to clean news out because uh the fan would draw in addition to fumes they would draw some light off of this uh so he was up on top on these rollers cleaning up the hood and with supposedly nonflamable solven 

Recording: (5193/ 9621) 
i i well that is a that is a tough one uh and i remember when you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the barry boys and stuff you know we are uh pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but and to me that is fake you know uh and i never really thought about when i was growing up as to it was what was real and everything you know i always knew that by either again or by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that that died it was not a it was not a game you know uh and i would hate to think that that would cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody else he he and other human beings i mean that does not i do not even know why there should be any concern for him i guess that is why 

Recording: (5194/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5195/ 9621) 
yeah i do not think that women should be on the front lines uh some women are are physically able to do but to do it some definitely are not of course there is a same by the same token some men are not but uh as as support groups i think that is all right 

Recording: (5196/ 9621) 
i mean he 

Recording: (5197/ 9621) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her uh parents divorce when she is about four her mother is now alcohol like her father said that he would take her with him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself it it is a big it it is terrible thing is what she is had to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that is helped straighten him out some and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the the drugs was not the problem and we dealt with several counselors and that is all they wanted to deal with our problems always been at the symptom and took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally uh cheryl is he is very intuitive and even as a toddler he could do this he he seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him 

Recording: (5198/ 9621) 
it was real close to my home 

Recording: (5199/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5200/ 9621) 
but he would bring in a nutritionist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (5201/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5202/ 9621) 
okay so they it is just like an independent contractor for them 

Recording: (5203/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5204/ 9621) 
um i think i think through education that is it is just gonna only help kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do 

Recording: (5205/ 9621) 
yeah oh my uh i am in this uh venturing career which is through boy scouts our leader has this like society totally planned out 

Recording: (5206/ 9621) 
back then i was working in a cycle shop but i was in the service while i was working there 

Recording: (5207/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5208/ 9621) 
crime and stuff uh i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over uh but people have been better off financially overall um and i and i do not think he is made any i do not i would not say he is made his major mistakes policy wise well yes it his personal life just in his east and south yeah 

Recording: (5209/ 9621) 
i mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where i mean i can not say there is anything really different 

Recording: (5210/ 9621) 
no that is 

Recording: (5211/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5212/ 9621) 
but i mean that is not to say that i do not like being catholic or whatever 

Recording: (5213/ 9621) 
uh it is just there we go again who is right who is wrong i have no idea 

Recording: (5214/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (5215/ 9621) 
but you had to you you had to work you had to you had to migrate they they started set putting the family up by saying sir if you want a job we are expecting to los angeles we are so they set the family up 

Recording: (5216/ 9621) 
yeah i think so i think in high school there was or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school because there were pregnant girls in my high school 

Recording: (5217/ 9621) 
oh my goodness 

Recording: (5218/ 9621) 
yeah that is that is pretty much out there 

Recording: (5219/ 9621) 
um yeah give some charity and keep care of your bills and probably go on that vacation you have been dying for like you are making my brain water here over australia 

Recording: (5220/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5221/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5222/ 9621) 
it is like a mail order catalog thing and um so i do not know people are really really incompetent it is really funny like for some people um i do not know how they even some people who can not speak english even well enough i do not know how they got signed up or how that you would have a credit card order i mean and too you can tell especially when because people call from all over it is really funny to talk to people from alabama or south carolina i never knew people from south carolina had such stick accents i never really thought of north carolina south carolina being really southern even though i mean they visited first you know i mean uh i i just as just that is different i always thought that more being east coast as opposed to so southern and and there is people there you know you can not even understand what they are saying and like um especially to how it is all like you have to give numbers and all numbers and stuff and type it in real fast and people go unbelievable fast when they say like a ten string number and then they get mad at you and like you can not type it in fast enough like if they just said it slow once it would save time and um just how to how how three d eight a and a bunch of numbers all sound the same like d b three eight a all something the same and um and people you know you know like a is in apple and they are like apple what what are you talking about something like that something like that is real weird and um just how there is my membership number and they can not find it and and you know and you know like our area look on the catalog where it says m e m number that that is that would be your membership number and people are going all right all right but i do not know like i i really do not i really want to get a job that is like you know warehouse or something something real easy where i can just like load boxes or something because i never have time to really i mean like i try and do do like kind of i try to do york go but it is like the we work two thirty two eleven so it is like by the time you get home it is like you are going to sit and like not do anything and like um you know working out as hard and stuff because you know i have time so i want to have a job where if i do not have time at the end of the day to work out it is like i am working out sort of like as during my job and like i i really hate talking on the phone now like having jobs for a while where i talk on the phone makes me just not want to talk on the phone at all at home or to like when i am on the phone at home like then it like brings weird flashbacks to work so it is like i will start like talking like i am at work you know so it is like like i do not know i have to go to the phone like 

Recording: (5223/ 9621) 
yeah my dad is a chauvinist pig but he still lives 

Recording: (5224/ 9621) 
but certainly is like is is like pretty much accessible because 

Recording: (5225/ 9621) 
yeah well i i asked the germans what the what stereotypes they like are prevalent in germany uh of americans and they said you know americans or cowboys and he mcdonald is three meals a day 

Recording: (5226/ 9621) 
i do not want to tend to ever leave here so 

Recording: (5227/ 9621) 
but i imagine your siblings has a a similar world view perhaps twisted in some to 

Recording: (5228/ 9621) 
because i mean i have got a lot i have loved this man to death it is like and that might be something that was is holding back from dating but you know it will eventually go away whole thing but um yeah i would worn her i do not care if uh if he is he looks like the perfect guy because yeah i think he looks like he is a very nice guy and you know he just does not know how to stick with one woman i do not think yeah 

Recording: (5229/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5230/ 9621) 
how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry those things out i think it is it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (5231/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5232/ 9621) 
and i think that sometimes they do not even count all the voters i mean sometimes that they really want to go through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen that somehow or other they will count it so it did or they will you know 

Recording: (5233/ 9621) 
if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (5234/ 9621) 
i do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (5235/ 9621) 
the part now it takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching 

Recording: (5236/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (5237/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (5238/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5239/ 9621) 
i was just listening to music and i got a little side tracked from this uh tree across the way got destroyed by lightning i looked across and it started raining and wind was a little heavy rock themy back and forth like this i got up all the way looked around and i said what the hell is going on here turn on the radio and they said something uh you know thunderstorm coming through and it will be gone by twenty minutes or something and this truck man it felt like it was going to tip over i just i got out of there real fast and uh started walking down towards it is about uh probably about a good twenty mile walk to where the nearest uh twenty four hour house of pan cakes is you ever been down there the i hop 

Recording: (5240/ 9621) 
because i they feel they have the need for it there is so many golfers i mean that sports went god i mean when my mom used to play golf growing up and they only let them on the golf course is one day a week which is amazing it was like on a tuesday and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought they were only allowed women one day a week you know it is not amazing there is so many good women golfers now and but they said they are too slow and they always talk and and that just killed me when my mom that is the only day she could play and she wanted to play more 

Recording: (5241/ 9621) 
that is one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was we were shopping for school systems just as much you know so and i do not want to buy a house and i do not want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school since uh because it seems like since we have bought our house the houses are just doubling and tribble and value it is unbelievable yeah oh i do not know ours has increased quite a lot since we have been there but we have been there i guess about ten years oh we rented in grand view 

Recording: (5242/ 9621) 
i have been in the same house for seventeen years 

Recording: (5243/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5244/ 9621) 
no i we actually had student tickets that people did not want clear up on the seatback um but we enjoy it because we a lot of times we walk in 

Recording: (5245/ 9621) 
that that would be seriously fun but uh it depends if you work industry you get money 

Recording: (5246/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (5247/ 9621) 
and uh the changes in them is like a lot it is got robbed a lot more um because my grandfather kept the shotgun and made the counter but um um eastern um eastern is crazy um 

Recording: (5248/ 9621)

Recording: (5254/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5255/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5256/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5257/ 9621)

Recording: (5263/ 9621) 
i think it is been good i mean the economy has been very good um it seems like society seems to be improving you know even though we talked about this 

Recording: (5264/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5265/ 9621) 
okay so uh he got dispelled from catholic school for behavior problems 

Recording: (5266/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (5267/ 9621)

pick up bodies 

Recording: (5271/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (5272/ 9621) 
that is a good way 

Recording: (5273/ 9621) 
she is works in a in a school building and she she feels all uh troubled and 

Recording: (5274/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5275/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and that is the thing about the schools too you know and totally disagree with uniforms you know unless it is all slacks all of it because you get the the girls in the uniforms and they are short and they can not enforce that they do not enforce that and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row i should have went and met him or i should have said hey you know here this is you know him and met me and i and i really you know fault myself for that but it is made me more aware too and i you know when you look at somebody and say oh you would never dream that they well i do you know there is not anything i do not put past anybody doing i really do not because they just yeahno no i do because there is some good ones out there and there is some bad ones too but you know 

Recording: (5276/ 9621) 
um three years 

Recording: (5277/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5278/ 9621) 
oh yeah they showed they cut open the uh pulling this baby out of this little hole of this lady is stomach and i just uh i had heart surgery when i was younger and so i have had lots of needles and those types of things and i when it comes to needles and and that kind of stuff and just kind of squeamish about it you know so that stuff i just i just do not want to see it 

Recording: (5279/ 9621) 
but i mean i honestly do think i would at least go to church on occasion if it was not forced on me i mean it just got sort of just to the point of being ridiculous going seventeen eighteen years every single week 

Recording: (5280/ 9621) 
and i like stereo is tv is uh watchers dryers uh like weird things too like i have seen on tv things you know 

Recording: (5281/ 9621) 
uh how many i do not know it does not matter uh but in in many ones that were too hard for me 

Recording: (5282/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5283/ 9621) 
we 

Recording: (5284/ 9621) 
baseball like i collected baseball cards i lived in detroit and so that is why i like stuck with me so like i i remember i had my tops out in third grade like you are allowed to bring one item because like you are a little kid it is like making you feel better and i brought my detroit is eye hat so like and like i i oh like out on the way to detroit or boston and boston just because i i uh was born there but and like people make fun of me they are like you know because detroit is horrible they are in the last place 

Recording: (5285/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5286/ 9621) 
yeah probably have to go to double under you know worthington somewhere around there to find couple millionaers but uh 

Recording: (5287/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5288/ 9621) 
yeah i i think they are two faced 

Recording: (5289/ 9621) 
yeah you really do yeah 

Recording: (5290/ 9621) 
no no they take no they take the money whether you are in it or not you have no choice you have a choice as to whether you are a member or not but they still take the money and if you cross the line they will take that money back so anybody that yeah you know you are better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time i did some of that interview it is tough to you know columbus has a big you know job market there is everywhere you look there is help on it so but it is tough to get to a job where you can just walk in and start today or you know tell them hey you know the minute that strikes over i am gone and so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job so oh yeah three weeks that pays yeah it cost quite a bit of money but we got some strike pay and this and that but it was not a lot you know two hundred dollars a week is not much at all so and when you have a family and you i mean two hundred dollars a week does not pay my day care bill so so it is going to be tight for our family for a few months you know to get back on 

Recording: (5291/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5292/ 9621) 
and they stopped doing that now 

Recording: (5293/ 9621)

uh-huh 

Recording: (5297/ 9621) 
you can get in huge arguments people like no you are lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them to die and honestly i can honestly say i would not want that to happen to them 

Recording: (5298/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (5306/ 9621)

Recording: (5308/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5309/ 9621) 
the government is always good for money 

Recording: (5310/ 9621)

Recording: (5312/ 9621) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (5313/ 9621) 
or they use the bible to say well you know god is specifically says and it is chapter not to partake in spiritual activity well who do you think wrote that you know 

Recording: (5314/ 9621) 
and it it was fun i met a lot of neat people in fact that is where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one of the artists who came to me and it but it was not nobody was going to make any money on it and it was the kind of thing that it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project and i did not know anything about it i would never even been in a gallery i thought uh this will be fun i will just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying to think of something i could do with it so i said well i will rent this space and then i know what i will do i will just put it down in the paper and i will find a bunch of artists and then i will set this business up so and it was consignment so i did not need that that money i just needed rent and we had art classes and that was fun and so once i got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go it is not nearly as interesting once you know you i like i like to make it happen i am not really interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come in and so when the lease was up on high street i was gonna get rid of it and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said could we please you know would you consider having some partners and i said sure if you guys are willing to come and send us a place and i do not have to come and sit here so we moved to grandview and it was doing much better over there and um then the same thing happened the attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space and when our lease was up they had more money than we did so we were going to have to move again and i just said this is not worth it and besides that i was ready that was about three or four years into it i was ready to do something else and i had already started taking care of jesse then so i used to take him down to the galley with me and i had a little bass and that in the back and people think is that baby 

Recording: (5315/ 9621) 
it is open twenty four hours so there is people that you know it is like shifts over lapping out of something like everybody leaves and then everybody comes in you know it is like um i can where there like the night shift people start to come in and people that work from like eight to four eight eight p m to four am and that would be really weird i guess like nobody calls in or something like ten people calls so she is like it is easy she is like i get paid to 

Recording: (5316/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5317/ 9621) 
i did not know you know what the problem was and you know i just kept having these problems with them so they told me i needed to take them to the school set i needed to be a psychiatrist a psychologist and uh so i took of it she said do you think this is normal you know because he is like rolling off the chair and banging dolls together so i do not know i said i got one brother i do not know how boys are supposed to be she said well this is not normal uh okay so uh i do not know i tried taking him to um psychologist they did like behavior therapy i brought him here to ohio state and put him in a an experiment uh he was in it for about three years working with the food supplement and uh it actually did real well for him and the researcher gave me what he you know it is like sort of like taking vitamins he gave me supplies of that even after the project was over but then after there was not anymore he could not give it to me and it cost too much for me to buy it 

Recording: (5318/ 9621)

Recording: (5332/ 9621) 
um i feel that the past season the past two seasons really have not been as strong as the earlier seasons and so in some ways i am you know i i i i am not as upset about the actual files competing it is run as i have been about other shows i mean it is also the simpsons final season i have heard 

Recording: (5333/ 9621) 
i might be wrong because my answer would not be that good on that question no offense but you know what i mean 

Recording: (5334/ 9621) 
um the things that i notice that are different i guess i mean if you look like uh as far as expansion and obviously there is a lot of areas that that are developed now that did not used to be 

Recording: (5335/ 9621) 
i was raised so dumb i am not you know i was not going for that stuff anymore and he is still wanted to do that you know and lie and cheat and make up stories and and he still does it i do not and and i do not understand why i feel like he is a grown man if he was out do not make up a story and his mother also make you know there just it just it is very stressful for me and and not that is another another reason why i do not want my son going there for you know much longer um but his dad pays pays her for the baby sitting because i can not afford it 

Recording: (5336/ 9621) 
yeah yeah then they will not want to go anywhere with you anyway so it is probably a pipe degree 

Recording: (5337/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5338/ 9621) 
well i do not think he exaggerated but he uh he was selective about the penalty 

Recording: (5339/ 9621) 
what and the first episode the first half was excellent it had the cigarette smoking man just it was from his perspective he was talking about and then the second half got like 

Recording: (5340/ 9621) 
and um you know to look at him go oh my water broke oh no and watch him flip out you know like on movies but um he did i would not we did not get to do that so 

Recording: (5341/ 9621) 
and most of the time they are putting them in charge well like we get no offense we get these college students coming out to where second lieutenant at thought they would know everything 

Recording: (5342/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5343/ 9621) 
i was right i forgot you guys have like a big gangerick population you know and like oh i had like you know all these deer and stuff so it is like they have 

Recording: (5344/ 9621) 
yeah because it is all continuously mixed it is like the it is not it is not real yeah i like it how like the rapes it is kind of like faceless because it is like it is not more like rock star oriented and stuff it is more it is more like kind of a serious type type thing but but but not so like glamorous and like fame oriented and stuff 

Recording: (5345/ 9621) 
his my boyfriend is aunt friday they their their kid is has that really hyperness um 

Recording: (5346/ 9621) 
you know like if our system would shut down if it cost us i do not remember what it is you know tens of thousands of dollars for every hour that were down uh if our data base would be trashed our main data base would be trash we would have real serious problems and it could take weeks or months to rebuild it uh yeah so it could be a problem uh we have got people working in that area 

Recording: (5347/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5348/ 9621) 
i like seeing them grow up together and 

Recording: (5349/ 9621) 
which reminds me 

Recording: (5350/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5351/ 9621)

Recording: (5354/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5355/ 9621) 
you know like work hard when you have to 

Recording: (5356/ 9621) 
you know you got two adults and your has it does not matter which age they are 

Recording: (5357/ 9621)

Recording: (5360/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5361/ 9621) 
really they are they are the biggest asimov 

Recording: (5362/ 9621) 
and then that or uh sort of good 

Recording: (5363/ 9621) 
yeah we are going to have to give it up by friday because the strike is over they will not let us keep it anymore 

Recording: (5364/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5365/ 9621) 
i see 

Recording: (5366/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5367/ 9621) 
i am i am not built that way 

Recording: (5368/ 9621) 
they are 

Recording: (5369/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5370/ 9621) 
you know okay that is what i am doing wrong i will not do it again and then nobody asked me out for a few more years so 

Recording: (5371/ 9621) 
well the furniture the dining room sets uh the uh chairs the couches 

Recording: (5372/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5373/ 9621) 
they are going to come and ask you something no matter what you say 

Recording: (5374/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5375/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5376/ 9621) 
and uh it was very hard for some of the younger people and students uh to get up there because of transportation 

Recording: (5377/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5378/ 9621) 
so you knew you have heard about that probably 

Recording: (5379/ 9621) 
and you are not being recorded now 

Recording: (5380/ 9621) 
i never thought about that 

Recording: (5381/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5382/ 9621) 
um professionalism as well 

Recording: (5383/ 9621) 
i play with computers um normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day or what i did the day before if they asked me any anything here so um what did i do today what i did today internet information servers a product by microsoft it lets you house went pages and put them out on the map index service another product that lets you put search changes on that um then there is another product by a company called it is like uh called net stock it is uh-huh net stock basically goes out to yaho who in checks to see what the stock prices on something are and so i made an end stock irs and index server all play nicely together today 

Recording: (5384/ 9621) 
that is it 

Recording: (5385/ 9621) 
that should not be on the other hand i hate to see a thirteen year old have a baby because she was afraid 

Recording: (5386/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5387/ 9621) 
well i do not i hear some of that from gorbachev and that is much 

Recording: (5388/ 9621) 
it is a cartoon i believe it started out 

Recording: (5389/ 9621) 
oh it was there was a lot of discouraging things just i mean i learned so much it and it was not always just the people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times 

Recording: (5390/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (5391/ 9621) 
there were a couple that would go to rapes every now and then and use it 

Recording: (5392/ 9621) 
against them in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5393/ 9621) 
of the times and memories and stuff 

Recording: (5394/ 9621) 
and that is where the ohio state players i do not know if you know they stay there every night for a game i mean it is the most expensive hotel and columbus all the players stay there but to my amazment they come down for a uh i think they have a dinner and then they come down for a midnight snack and so funny all these guys come down there shorts and stuff 

Recording: (5395/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5396/ 9621) 
but i think that is kind of nice 

Recording: (5397/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5398/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5399/ 9621) 
raised eleven 

Recording: (5400/ 9621) 
just like 

Recording: (5401/ 9621) 
about two two and a half years ago 

Recording: (5402/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (5403/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5404/ 9621) 
in a heart be trying to help them but they do not i do not think they make an effort to like put out any you know 

Recording: (5405/ 9621) 
the majority of the ones that do not get the guides at home that you are trying to reaching on go to boy scouts 

Recording: (5406/ 9621) 
they are they have a very nice standard of living all of them do 

Recording: (5407/ 9621) 
and so they offered to move them back 

Recording: (5408/ 9621) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (5409/ 9621) 
a parakeet yes a little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (5410/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5411/ 9621) 
they start running those campaigns so that i will kind of kind of read up on it but i have not i have not really 

Recording: (5412/ 9621) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we you know we knew a lot of stuff we were going to we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are going to regret this someday i said another ten years we will be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either was my wife or i to be very independent uh so it gets to the point that when we were first married it was hard to make a simple decision on anything you know we have worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own on anything but you know we wanted to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independent we said stop her and go ahead it is like even go to mcdonald is or something and he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even it is six and seven years old and tell him 

Recording: (5413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5414/ 9621) 
oh my gosh they just 

Recording: (5415/ 9621) 
nope i met him through a friend i met him through his brother was dating my best friend 

Recording: (5416/ 9621) 
yeah he is really good 

Recording: (5417/ 9621) 
i think it would 

Recording: (5418/ 9621) 
and that is what i like to 

Recording: (5419/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5420/ 9621) 
hit the marks sometimes so he gets to clean the toilet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (5421/ 9621) 
anything else is a hardware failure and you have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do probably remember one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (5422/ 9621) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (5423/ 9621) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (5424/ 9621) 
like uh oh from mormon is well our basic um real fundamental belief is that the church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve bible and but after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those apollo and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and or all the orthodontics church it still carried all these beliefs 

Recording: (5425/ 9621) 
um no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5426/ 9621) 
yeah not not for special conditions nothing just universal it is wrong 

Recording: (5427/ 9621) 
oh i think i would do it in a minute but my family does not want it there my husband thinks we are fine he does not want any more around and all my kids they are so used to all their own 

Recording: (5428/ 9621) 
and until the consumer becomes on the equal knowledge level as the uh it is always gonna be an equitable and you are gonna have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the devover is something well let us see well we can make condos down the size of the house and we want to make this we want to make this margin of profit yeah we do well what about for society is best interest 

Recording: (5429/ 9621) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy 

Recording: (5430/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5431/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5432/ 9621) 
yeah it is but see i have always i i have one floor is where i live now i vacuumed in them i mean i am just the type you know i did not want pet hair and 

Recording: (5433/ 9621) 
but yeah i and discipline she is not she is not as strict as i am i do not 

Recording: (5434/ 9621) 
i do not know i do not know i am sure it would happen because there is all kinds of whacky people out there seriously i do not know i have family members that are homosexual that is just my own personal thing belief i do not know i think that is they should not have taken it off of the dm s whatever it was i do not know 

Recording: (5435/ 9621) 
yeah you you follow the script and uh that is real funny too like you know you get um they they listen to you like they monitor the calls and um you know they listen to you and it is like does she like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know set it in this way like if you used this or whatever you know and like um i do not know it is just real weird 

Recording: (5436/ 9621) 
oh i know it is so much fun 

Recording: (5437/ 9621) 
oh i 

Recording: (5438/ 9621) 
it is just like your people you see go to church or walk out to church to see somebody sitting there at homeless 

Recording: (5439/ 9621) 
gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (5440/ 9621) 
yeah when i first went to oakland i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i would maybe thought to major in music education or at least have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my my teaching possibilities and uh although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science um it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5441/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5442/ 9621) 
yeah right yeah 

Recording: (5443/ 9621) 
um-hum i just got done doing some roofing and i was supposed to meet my girlfriend out there she never did show up so i had to walk from incredible we are incredible universities to be well just say hillyard and two seventy all the way back this way one campus without water oh man talk about being stuck in the desert 

Recording: (5444/ 9621) 
just at home i just have a tape that i use it is kathy smith one of her things that i really like 

Recording: (5445/ 9621) 
i answered it right 

Recording: (5446/ 9621) 
person she is pretty high up i guess i was on a on a where 

Recording: (5447/ 9621) 
but i managed to get that much information out so the other cop goes upstairs and chris chris is in to a station of a story at those point is one moment i am carefully planning on the computer and the next moment i i turned around there is a large police officer in the area of your room he said hi he said i think you should come downstairs they do not talk or anything so chris comes downstairs and he stands beside me 

Recording: (5448/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5449/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5450/ 9621) 
i do not argue with them i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (5451/ 9621) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeahuhhuh huh uh-huh huhhm um-hum um-hum i know um-hum that is another thing i forgot to mention uhhuhumhum exactly exactly exactly from family yeah wellyeah but something i have learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i you know talk to is that you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of uh in your home type of thing and you do not really go around and yeah we sleep in the same bed and we breast feed still and you just kind of if they ask you like yeah well yeah that is just the way we are doing it so 

Recording: (5452/ 9621) 
no it is real like to live off campus you have to well after my class it will be twenty two and senior credit status but my class was twenty one or senior or senior credit so i got to move off campus but like had i been a year younger i would not have been able to because i have to wait until twenty two so the 

Recording: (5453/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5454/ 9621) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to the day care and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (5455/ 9621) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about things my oldest sister you know i get stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5456/ 9621) 
and uh well she the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first apartment community uh in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (5457/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5458/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5459/ 9621) 
there is some kind of tax program 

Recording: (5460/ 9621) 
uh it is kind of like uh you go to a private school and you get there maybe seven years old on up to fifteen sixteen and at sixteen they can actually determine give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and sixteen fifteen sixteen year old kid actually graduate from collegeyeah they have they have showed that study already i mean i think it is i think it is amazing yeah i mean when i first heard about it i said hey some doogie howser shit you know well but now it is just you know now it is kind of reality you know because i know pretty much a lot of skilled skilled trades i know how to cook pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness i mean you know go up on nature hikes and go fishing all that stuff just combine into oneand if those teachers can not study what that individual know what that individual wants young then older kids are not going to know what to do end up practicing well and not liking it going all that school for it 

Recording: (5461/ 9621) 
yes but it was interesting uh they did have uh enterprises where they they had religious assemble um religion was not uh all it was not all invasive in the school but they did have assemble and uh for religious holidays and that kind of thing and i remember thinking i am starting to think well what really separates uh a religion from a cult and i think it is just the the social acceptance of it really almost um and you know how many people are in it probably what number provides them i am not really sure yeah yeah yeah well i i like um i was i have been very politically active at various times in my past and uh especially i guess in the late seventies and early eighties i was very active in uh alternative energy fighting against nuclear power and uh i have been active at various times in animal rights movements and uh political campaigns uh foreign policy kinds of debates that kind of that kind of thing and one thing that i have noticed uh a lot is there are a lot of there well there there is a wide spectrum but in the uh there are a lot of liberals in the catholic church too you know the 

Recording: (5462/ 9621) 
uh we were floating around just did not know if they were going to send us in or not because it was toward the end of it 

Recording: (5463/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5464/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5465/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5466/ 9621) 
i am a spanish major 

Recording: (5467/ 9621) 
and it is funny too how people carry like people apologize to when when they are dumb or whatever and it is like like they care so much you know about somebody that they are talking to on the phone for like five minutes um it is it is what people sometimes ask me like where where we are you know i tell them like home miss iowa and like um like i talked to somebody from from uh new jersey she was like twenty or something for for a long time she was she was real funny just uh how how accents are and really she would say like horrible and uh same numbers like like nine and or kind of like uh east coast accent is real funny and she was just asking me like what it looked like in our building you know that is always funny too you know you call people from the phone you do not know what they look like you do not know what the other person looks like and what the building is set up like so there is 

Recording: (5468/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5469/ 9621) 
they are like you know small town living out in the country raising the kids you know the big house huge yard dog you know uh we keep looking and saying you know now how is this different or better for the kids so 

Recording: (5470/ 9621) 
yeah i like uh football and pool 

Recording: (5471/ 9621) 
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it 

Recording: (5472/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5473/ 9621) 
so like twice three times more price wise 

Recording: (5474/ 9621) 
makes and just keep an eye on what is going on 

Recording: (5475/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5476/ 9621) 
but the writing they give you one point for each paragraph so you have to get five points to pass and you might get four out of five and almost pass and then you have to retake that one part 

Recording: (5477/ 9621) 
yeah we yep you have to concentrate on what is important or just flies by and you do not even see it yeah 

Recording: (5478/ 9621) 
and uh the other one is uh a uh working company at the student billahio uh 

Recording: (5479/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5480/ 9621) 
yeah i grew up in plymouth i was born here uh i went to a went here uh i went to school as an undergrad 

Recording: (5481/ 9621) 
yeah did and then she she was kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all supported and nobody would support her 

Recording: (5482/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5483/ 9621) 
uh you know he is paying rent at his mother was not not really his mother and all but her uh so she can right uh he is he has to become more responsible responsible about a lot of things which is getting with the normal matcheration but he is just doing it the hard way 

Recording: (5484/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5485/ 9621) 
the real service now 

Recording: (5486/ 9621) 
do not you think too that the that the more they have found out psychologicallyally speaking about children and the placement of children in the family and the uh throws of not having enough or or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both know the exotic experience from being one of eleven children raised so you know you did not have the advantages that 

Recording: (5487/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5488/ 9621) 
well i did not know if you would give him a name or yeah if you can 

Recording: (5489/ 9621) 
whatever his name is arnold schwarzenegger he is into his kind of movies i like this like six cents i love that movie 

Recording: (5490/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (5491/ 9621) 
which kids 

Recording: (5492/ 9621) 
probably 

Recording: (5493/ 9621) 
i was about to see now on the record off the 

Recording: (5494/ 9621) 
i am from columbus ohio i was born and raised in columbus uh i grew up on the east side of columbus i graduated from high school i then started working for a high state in nineteen seventy seven and have been there here for twenty four years 

Recording: (5495/ 9621) 
yeah they are 

Recording: (5496/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5497/ 9621) 
and and that is what a lot of people are telling me you know just you know life to struggle 

Recording: (5498/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5499/ 9621) 
it it was not easy and at first it was probably a lot harder then after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to coming back here it was 

Recording: (5500/ 9621) 
because you know the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and you know at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer as all education stuff it is not game game it it has a game theme to it but 

Recording: (5501/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5502/ 9621) 
i think that uh it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5503/ 9621) 
boy it would have to be uh something that i actually enjoy um what happened was ever since i came to columbus almost every company i worked for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that uh because my husband works for the state so obviously he is not going anywhere um so i got tired of that and that is why i kind of went to dumping and stuff so it would be one with a variety um i am unfortunately say unfortunately good of the counties and stuff but that does not get to express my creative side as much so it would be um my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well and like we do presentations at ours and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (5504/ 9621) 
and it it is you know my mom you know she always says well what you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (5505/ 9621) 
at our desk we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (5506/ 9621) 
no i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (5507/ 9621) 
proops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5508/ 9621) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (5509/ 9621) 
you know they should not know where the keys are if they were used to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (5510/ 9621) 
which was scheduled in the evenings when i was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5511/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5512/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5513/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5514/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5515/ 9621) 
my boyfriend would love to mess with us i just want you to he would be like he he taking it apart putting it back together 

Recording: (5516/ 9621) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5517/ 9621) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5518/ 9621) 
they go she is got it and they go to the next guy and then all of a sudden you are going off this and they go uh so it is nice really that uh where are you going and you are like uh uh yeah told me to and then they go oh brother you know so now you know the attention is diverted to use so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there real professional yeah 

Recording: (5519/ 9621) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on you okay i i just have a question is gee is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5520/ 9621) 
you know my parents never did because um they knew i was always levelheaded i always had a lot of boy friends you know but i always i always felt like i was waiting for the right one 

Recording: (5521/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (5522/ 9621) 
instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5523/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (5524/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5525/ 9621) 
like i said i have been here twenty five years i have seen a lot of weird stuff fact is when i was a bigger i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 

Recording: (5526/ 9621) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5527/ 9621) 
he has to but that the more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is been because of the loss of up parent that you are in ability of up parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those things do are just and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage that is got 

Recording: (5528/ 9621) 
it does not matter how much money they are given for their education they 

Recording: (5529/ 9621) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children in our off spring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5530/ 9621) 
uh we are planning on moving in the spring 

Recording: (5531/ 9621) 
well number one it is a little bit smaller more controlled area quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to the sister you know my sister lives up there she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having all the peace and peace and quiet she wants yeah plus in a place that is only year old 

Recording: (5532/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (5533/ 9621) 
um just to get into the school there is about thirty people applying they let three n 

Recording: (5534/ 9621) 
yeah they could be yeah 

Recording: (5535/ 9621) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again it is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bar tend responsible but say you could come up i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5536/ 9621) 
all the cool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (5537/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5538/ 9621) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening in a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like council council states um you know just sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have loads of boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or you know we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who is interviewed with saying oh you know he had you know slept with like ten girls or something and i was thinking oh my gosh you know and he is thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my opinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kid even if they are not of working age they get like a an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think uh fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby they are provided they are the top of the list for a council house so they get they are on there is actually a long document around before i left um you know of this girl who is constantly fighting with her parents and you know her parents were at the end of their rope she got pregnant and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for the baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know what more could she want you know with basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do whatever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad situation because they are almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5539/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5540/ 9621) 
because i had a lot of frustration built up 

Recording: (5541/ 9621) 
so they built went on hillwood 

Recording: (5542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5543/ 9621) 
no and without a health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assume you are eighteen you could get a job like and try and pay for your health insurance i mean i am not saying it would be easy but still 

Recording: (5544/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5545/ 9621) 
yeah and then you can stay as long as you want you do not you know feel obligated and everybody just brings in food you know everybody brings their own stuff and it is fun i mean yeah it is from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it is just nonstop family everywhere so it is fun 

Recording: (5546/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (5547/ 9621) 
where from 

Recording: (5548/ 9621) 
yeah she is got she is got a lot of kids there is um three boys and like four girls 

Recording: (5549/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5550/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5551/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (5552/ 9621) 
i i guess i like to do but not probably i do not know 

Recording: (5553/ 9621) 
they are five hours from colorado so they still bad lands are not too far away and i guess it is like nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back you know they come at least once twice a year back to ohio 

Recording: (5554/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5555/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5556/ 9621) 
thing at first but she my she loves my kids and she loves my husband 

Recording: (5557/ 9621) 
sometimes people just go on and on about things like i i got a uh like they have like some like insane problem like i do not know why they are sharing it with me like you know like i had to get this you know i had to get this chair because my brotherinlaw yeah he sat on it and broke it man i got enough fight about that yeah his wife involved all going on and on about it and it is like like yep uh like his wife is is a bit or something i do not know i do not know what they are exactly going to say or like i talked to this one guy he was he was in the abcl and he did like a couple tours in vietnam and he was he was talking about how he was he was drunk and he was he was from alabama he was like yeah i am about half drunk now so i am trying to figure out where the model number is and like i will be talking to you for like fifteen minutes 

Recording: (5558/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (5559/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5560/ 9621) 
yeah she went down to western missouri 

Recording: (5561/ 9621) 
no no in fact the principal when she interviewed me asked me that and i said when we are raised in the unitary and sunday school it is a it is almost an indoctrination and tolerance for other religions so you are better off with me than somebody that believes there is is the only one true religion 

Recording: (5562/ 9621) 
you know what is of the gossap the gossap i heard was that uh uh the super in a new school said that if he was reelected she was going to resign and so they gave her a big raise so she must be as hard in her side 

Recording: (5563/ 9621) 
yeah well people is people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that to me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along trying to take it up space 

Recording: (5564/ 9621) 
there is there is like two people who are like from the uh i mean they are not old but they are like from the forties and they have bought generateers they bought water they have got extra food they have got a freeze extra freezer they bought ammunition it is like hello you know i just think it is 

Recording: (5565/ 9621) 
they yeah well the grandmother she says she is a christian but i do not see it i mean a lot of people claim they are something and you know which i might not be a total christian because i do not do all the right things but i do believe in god i do believe i am going to go to heaven i try not to you know send too much and i do pray to them and i you know i just i do not go to church like i i used to go to church all when i was growing up and now i you know i feel like you do not have to go to church to believe in god and all that you know i talked to them i talked to my grandparents that are in heaven and stuff you know that is just what i was raised as and 

Recording: (5566/ 9621) 
and i think this past year they had two murders over there and i was publicized in the clumbus area but uh it is 

Recording: (5567/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (5568/ 9621) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag or uh how much of uh how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law you know it could be something real real technical or something that a three year old could answer because it is trying to hit you know all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (5569/ 9621) 
but most most of the vegetables are available truly the zucchini the uh you will find your your green peppers smaller your i got a um cucumbers the other denver is either so big it i tell you i do not think it was that long 

Recording: (5570/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5571/ 9621) 
i mean obviously that is a long ways off um i i i guess i imagine i would be teaching in public schools though hopefully i could kind of get to where i was but but i i do not know i mean maybe i do not know is that i i do not even know if is it double and really better than than to call them by public or 

Recording: (5572/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5573/ 9621) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (5574/ 9621) 
well the coach he is pretty much got it all together you know he just needs to put everybody in their own separate category instead of having one person for one part of the team and then another person for another part of team and 

Recording: (5575/ 9621) 
yes yeah that is right you can not get a seat there 

Recording: (5576/ 9621) 
right on the top 

Recording: (5577/ 9621) 
they do not hurt it all before and they some of them had known me for a few years but uh i was told after i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else i do not i do not believe thatumhum 

Recording: (5578/ 9621) 
okay well it is coming from age school and i am twenty four i have got a two year old son and just had his birthday um thirty first so and i live by myself in a house and i work um up in that county apartment 

Recording: (5579/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5580/ 9621) 
maybe kind of hard in a but she gets into a engineering tech program because she has not had all the math prerequisite because she just did not stay in school long enough 

Recording: (5581/ 9621) 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (5582/ 9621) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (5583/ 9621) 
no thanks for caesar i am trying to call up 

Recording: (5584/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5585/ 9621) 
he talks about biting even though he is never bit and um there is one particular boy right now and his family leaves he just has complete tempered androfoams and he is tried that out a few times too he is one that you can leave and it does not be some he is very comfortable with other people but like a last month or so he is tried that a few times and i think he picks that up at day care seeing the other kids do that 

Recording: (5586/ 9621) 
well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just want to shoot somebody unfortunately anybody says that i i mean i am i do not even like stepping on the ants but there is those moments where like 

Recording: (5587/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5588/ 9621) 
well i do not know if it is minneapolis county or 

Recording: (5589/ 9621) 
oh yeah i think everybody should have nothing else you missed a boat by at that time 

Recording: (5590/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5591/ 9621) 
i i guess it is just over the course of the year and everything balances out you know so 

Recording: (5592/ 9621) 
i am 

Recording: (5593/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5594/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (5595/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5596/ 9621) 
um both times i stayed around this little town uh it is like northwest of munich so it was southern um most brooks 

Recording: (5597/ 9621) 
you are uh 

Recording: (5598/ 9621) 
kind of dwindling 

Recording: (5599/ 9621) 
with the the children 

Recording: (5600/ 9621) 
yeah i went to columbia public schools so uh then yeah on the on always over on the west side the same area of town always lived there so they are now um came up here to a i she will uh got my bachelor is in uh english lit and then went to case western reserve for a master is then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country which i got my library degree and the only job i could find was here in columbus 

Recording: (5601/ 9621) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (5602/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5603/ 9621) 
yeah i i you know i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter i was there every day about the poor thing all i put her through one we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i was not a child but it is like you know have realistic expectations of what what children are capable of or what they can do because if they are really verbal i mean our kids always have been really verbal because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even what you know when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole obviously see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really verbal and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster and i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she had not given and been giving him food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because but i mean now that is bizarre now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things there i i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (5604/ 9621) 
anyway you know so just simply living 

Recording: (5605/ 9621) 
the government whoever wants to be 

Recording: (5606/ 9621) 
uh-huh uhhuhumhumjohn does here he has some famous ideas jane does is over here on a personal is he used to be that you know you knew this person right over here that jane does and that thirduhhuh 

Recording: (5607/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5608/ 9621) 
so you can not isolate yourself with them it is like americans do not have a have a have a strong hold on it 

Recording: (5609/ 9621) 
well i will be honest i have a lot of home exceptial friends and being in the restaurant business and growing up in the restaurant business and that is how i really kind of met them when i was going to school i did not know any and i went to ou and i will see down there i did not know i did not know anybody was okay um i feel that a lot of people or i will say most of them or all of them are born that way some of them do make a choice um but i feel that it should be talked about in school um for so long it was in the closet you know they did not talk about it and these kids you know had to hide it and i just think in today is world and there is so many people that are openly gay that it should be talked about more in school i do i think you know especially i just think some and women there is women that you know i had my gym teacher okay but now that i look at it i did not know then but she was great i mean we did not i did not think that then i do not know why but she was very manly but she was very she was very good but she was you know just not feminine at all 

Recording: (5610/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (5611/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5612/ 9621) 
uh-huh uh-huh yeah it is always kind of scary i think you really need to get away from that to get yourself back 

Recording: (5613/ 9621) 
and they are far as cool 

Recording: (5614/ 9621) 
i am trying to think uh it they are my it is a my brand i know that is what we have it is like frito is instead of uh 

Recording: (5615/ 9621) 
um somehow really yeah and if they if everybody would just begin to build that way and when they start to say something nasty i would think well i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (5616/ 9621) 
so the way the university here around i can not agree with most of the stuff they did 

Recording: (5617/ 9621) 
changing the words does not change how someone feels about something 

Recording: (5618/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5619/ 9621) 
i met him here um the year i moved back from florida and he had just moved back from dallas he had lived there for ten years 

Recording: (5620/ 9621) 
i read in 

Recording: (5621/ 9621) 
of daylor under one of their their cartoons and the cartoon toward most of it 

Recording: (5622/ 9621) 
because i i did not own a telephone because i could not afford one and and also i thought if i had one they will call me well they would come you know if i did not get up that time on my day off they would come knocking at the door and say we need to go home for a trip 

Recording: (5623/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5624/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5625/ 9621) 
i hope not some of these mongers that goes around and always predict the worst things like everybody saying the you know when two thousand happens do not go out and sell right in new year is the year old world is got a hand well how is he go to ind you know uh 

Recording: (5626/ 9621) 
and otherwise than that i do not have hardly any trouble with the kids i have more trouble with the parents 

Recording: (5627/ 9621) 
um then you submit a portfolio on the fall for a view and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department 

Recording: (5628/ 9621) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider their like urban 

Recording: (5629/ 9621) 
just employers need to be employers just need to do that on their own and it is tough to be able to trust uh a business like that but it is a private business they need to be able to 

Recording: (5630/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5631/ 9621) 
last see yeah uh-huh uhhuhi think i could summarize uh just with a few words what you are meaning to say uh may be wrong but i think you are really meaning to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and they must recognize their children and uh do like you have just discussed uh do with them and and because today we are just dripping and dri and drafting and drafting we uh fifty percent of uh everyone who married has divorced within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics today and uh unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably um once again we are talking toward or have been headed toward and get back to a very basic family orientation it it it is abhorite when i hear that uh uh what was it seven ladies who were quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell their uh spring or well it is not their spring whatever it is they sell uh for ten thousand dollars a piece and be planted another so they take and produce a quote beautiful child or a beautiful child uh and if you are talking about just a physical features it is it is meaningful it is what is embodied in that body that is can be beautiful instead of just the not imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else is child over here and i am going to have the same thing because i think that is exactly fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instinct is toward or with that child 

Recording: (5632/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5633/ 9621) 
you probably know more than i do then really i never went there with him because um my dad is very against it he is a piscopagian so 

Recording: (5634/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5635/ 9621) 
honestly i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (5636/ 9621) 
they build big bond fires out there where the casting ponds was that just gate they have big bond fires when you are done skating 

Recording: (5637/ 9621) 
yes and no i mean we have high schoolers in there um it there is no requirements as far as what school you go to um but we get our internet service partially through ohio state and the last majority of college students go here 

Recording: (5638/ 9621) 
i would like to seen it passed just for the fact to see what the hell they would have done with the money but uh i do not blame people for voting for the one and not vote for the other because you are talking about something twenty years and engineering a civil engineering friend years ago and uh i was at worth had actually chemical which is over in double and i lived over where i am living now and every year they were doing work on two seventy you know so i get this off them and be be bitching at them about it and everything you know and they go you know realize you know by the time we get something approved through all the parameters you got to go through it and everything and then they start working on it and then they get it done it is probably ten fifteen years old 

Recording: (5639/ 9621) 
and she can be called damn 

Recording: (5640/ 9621) 
so anyway we we had a fine field day that one day i fired at them the next morning about ten oclock we heard one i heard a shell coming in and it was on the air force back of us about five hundred yards 

Recording: (5641/ 9621) 
oh blue eye that is right um-hum

Recording: (5651/ 9621) 
whereas you know 

Recording: (5652/ 9621) 
i think the main problem with this year was the coaching it is good that they got rid of two coaches but his attitude i just do not think the kids think of him as a role model and i think a coach has to be a role model i used to work at the high at on capitol square 

Recording: (5653/ 9621) 
usually every weekend 

Recording: (5654/ 9621) 
because i have seen a lot of bad parents i have seen a lot of bad people you know what i mean i have seen people you know you always hear about drugs and all that i have seen people sitting there drinking 

Recording: (5655/ 9621) 
um that is on road 

Recording: (5656/ 9621) 
oh wow oh so you have it on the speed dial 

Recording: (5657/ 9621) 
anyway he he went in for listen here i think and then he was ditched and then he was called back and and sent to vietnam and it was a sort of a traumatic experience for him that i think he has pretty well come out of but he was in a rear area he never was up where he was doing any shooting himself but uh he was on kp one day and uh he said they had a big an area held away from any of the other buildings where they were in trash and that sort of stuff so he said uh that is why i just said uh she make her take a can of trash out and uh and burn out yeah probably better just take some gasoline to throw all that stuff to uh get it to burn so he did he went out there and threw some gasoline on it not knowing that one of the other kp is had been there ahead of him and thrown gasoline on it so there was i do not have much gasoline on it when he threw a match on it 

Recording: (5658/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (5659/ 9621) 
is it like a honeyman justination too like the caribbean jamaica

Recording: (5670/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5671/ 9621)

Recording: (5672/ 9621) 
um transportation issue that was kind of a i thought that real system would kind of cool you know which is which is kind of tough the question is do we want to spend the money on it and when people actually use it um i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you know like in a people driving both ways and i think if people are actually if they are going to make it so people are actually going to use it i think it probably a pretty good thing to have and i i vote for it i can not believe you are going to do that 

Recording: (5673/ 9621) 
you know so 

Recording: (5674/ 9621)

Recording: (5700/ 9621) 
you know the options are your bed down i had to take my down because i broke my ankle fall quarter

Recording: (5703/ 9621) 
christians 

Recording: (5704/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (5705/ 9621) 
or more accurately i think she took it but and it is a fine line um and so she wears that around and i replaced it so i have my own again so we have a competition to see who can get the most world travel to around you get two points of every country and you get one point for every state or violence within that country 

Recording: (5706/ 9621) 
there were things out but there is nothing like what they have today you know small little handguns and things like that that are really easy carryable and cartialable i mean like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things like that i mean i mean there is really nothing too different 

Recording: (5707/ 9621) 
maybe 

Recording: (5708/ 9621) 
it is better in terms of the yards 

Recording: (5709/ 9621)

Recording: (5713/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5714/ 9621) 
um it was scary okay and it it was funny because you see the cops first but in reality the cops are behind two other people that actually know but it does not matter because you always see cops first so the two other people that actually know are my stepmother stepmother um parents stepmother and father have been split up for i do not know a month or two now they have been married for something like six months now and um my sister and i both wanted to tell her how the time that she was making a horrible mistake but she would not have listened to us we did not bother telling her 

Recording: (5715/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5716/ 9621) 
and i mean i do not think a lot of people have ever heard of ex to see until that movie 

Recording: (5717/ 9621)

Recording: (5718/ 9621) 
i had the same thing happen to my kid i i smack him one time 

Recording: (5719/ 9621) 
professors and everything but i think you know they get a lot of these kids and they do not care about school but they will they leave early because they know they can do it 

Recording: (5720/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5721/ 9621) 
right yeah 

Recording: (5722/ 9621) 
fire a couple around the pool right back in so uh that night our captain who one of these go go guys took one of our guns and a gun crew and they went up to where they could line line am on that 

Recording: (5723/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5724/ 9621) 
now he does a lot of maintenance he was doing drywall before this i kind of wish these stuff would that 

Recording: (5725/ 9621) 
most but almost he is always saying oh this is racist and that is racist but i do not think it is too bad in columbus i know there are places lots worse like the south and so on course uh who who really knows the race issue is such a big question 

Recording: (5726/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5727/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5728/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (5729/ 9621) 
but i am not sure how it is going to work you know i mean i i did oh well she is um web site is under construction i am like whoa darn it so then you know my aunt works here and all my cousins most of them graduated here so kind of want to follow them uh go with the flow but uh you know i did some other ones you know email and you know if you have this program can you tell me something about it and and it was actually i think it was stanford it was on a tv show i think it was like extra or something i do not know what it was and they were had a program on where um these older students you know met for the first time and i at their graduation you know they finished their whole college on internet and i said well that would be very easy for me and i could do it at my convenience like when he is asleep i can go and do that i think he would make it a lot easier to get up getting up is a very hard task very big bags like i can see 

Recording: (5730/ 9621) 
i do not know uh this freedom semi quasai freedom there is an allusion of freedom and a reality of freedom uh and the indian people know the big difference of that 

Recording: (5731/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5732/ 9621) 
yeah so or how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty iq for example and you know he is not going to get all the details and the battles and the years and the captain is names but you just want to get the overall just of the french and american war was about this time of in history and this was the result and this is how on it lasted just the main concepts well there is the kid that you say todd you study for the test and when you come in i will let you answer anything on the test you know and anything you do not know you leave blank and i will just grade what you put down 

Recording: (5733/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (5734/ 9621) 
the uh or the yeah the government mayors the you know but then look at them i mean there is another example well yeah i mean it is said that is not the that is not the case but it is all it is in a a man too you know i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we have had to live with them forever you know even g movies that little kids are going to see if there is a woman in there 

Recording: (5735/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (5736/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (5737/ 9621) 
it is very informal here so i do not know what we were doing but 

Recording: (5738/ 9621) 
like that like military but like unlimited military that does not seem right either but 

Recording: (5739/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5740/ 9621) 
that is parents can pick him up and everybody was annoyed my husband said i i want to let her stay i do not understand why you are doing this i do not care i want her to come home the other well by my eye it was hysterical because she and this little boy they are outside and he they are jumping and he is jumping on the trampoline and i that is okay my mom would never let me do that so i was thinking you know here is all everybody is acting like i am the bad guy and i am i am the one who is in right and so i was i am so sure of her real thing that was funny because um there was she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i would not let her skip because it was for a party that her friends were having and i understand it was important to her but when you have commitments you you keep it company and so it was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case she goes so what is it with him he never has an opinion how come all of a sudden he allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do you know and it was really funny we laughed about it and i let her um i let her skip it because i decided that it was so important to her 

Recording: (5741/ 9621) 
yeah i mean but i mean we are not in a depression and and the you know the employment rate is fine and health care is we have got some improvements there and like i said that it is too long too it is like no you know but i just i mean someone would say he is done a a horrible horrible job but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we wasted where we could have spent that money on something else you know and you end up doing that 

Recording: (5742/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5743/ 9621) 
i think they do uh 

Recording: (5744/ 9621) 
is that the way jesus christ sort of brought that here well some people have their opinion i said no no i said you you wear that collar if you do something about that if you do not then i will realize what a mindless person you are but you will never find me in your church again so i have done what i have done but and there is a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spiritual quality and they will become selfproclaimed spiritual leaders uh they will learn about the sweats there is some people that uh taking pictures of sweat lodges which you are not supposed to do well they show step by step how to build one and tell you what some kind of wood to build it out of and ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood um there is a way to do it and there is a way to do it uh it has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that um because the people this land were given specific instructions from the creative through vision through a woman called the white buffalo california that came to the people and brought them these ceremony like to sweatloge they brought them stakerwo it is not a it is not a belief thing it is a way of life and it is a way of life that is still a danger of being snuffed out but it will not be it is just it will not be it is just we got to be careful about uh how in what you do and if you look you know native american spiritual or religion for lack of a better word uh because our people believe in the religion you can not uh you can not encompasses one word everything that is into one word 

Recording: (5745/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5746/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5747/ 9621) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is driving force for our of our of our government and and even like because without without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations they could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to a degree they have become fairly powerful but i do not think that is necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that supported supported the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you do not necessarily need a union 

Recording: (5748/ 9621) 
our dorms are cleaner 

Recording: (5749/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5750/ 9621) 
the hate 

Recording: (5751/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5752/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5753/ 9621) 
um i do not know i think they are enjoying it i do not know you know 

Recording: (5754/ 9621)

Recording: (5755/ 9621) 
is extraordinarily similar uh so what she says might not might be diameteral close to what i say 

Recording: (5756/ 9621) 
then she grew up on me too you know 

Recording: (5757/ 9621) 
um i can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever um just because obviously you basically may make your parents as far as what you do when you are young and things like that and obviously if you all had to male parents or whatever obviously you might be thinking more towards like dating guys and things like that um i do not know if that would be really a problem though i mean i do not know if that would honestly happen 

Recording: (5758/ 9621) 
germany and everything that was really neat 

Recording: (5759/ 9621) 
and we started talking again and it was just like we had missed any time and started dating 

Recording: (5760/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i do not see any particular reason for her to wear the standacks except for to appeal to a uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which uh i think it does 

Recording: (5761/ 9621) 
convicted two white men and the third one is on trial now it will be interesting to see what happens to him because he says he did not have that big a role in it 

Recording: (5762/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5763/ 9621) 
like 

Recording: (5764/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5765/ 9621) 
um-hum do you have that three people in fall quarters three people in spring quarter 

Recording: (5766/ 9621) 
it is it is uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh they are they are they are or some things like that yeah uh sidney uh sidney opera house i have a picture that in my head with the big shelves the big you know that is a neat place 

Recording: (5767/ 9621) 
had to pack it up 

Recording: (5768/ 9621) 
yeah and geometry and and trigger and of physics and a little smattering of everything and uh i bet i could not pass the i bet i could not pass the math without some instruction but my son did not pass the writing party past the everything but the writing part and the writing part they asked you to write two five paragraph essay and they give you these topics and you can pick from them and you have to do it right there in like a three hour block of time 

Recording: (5769/ 9621) 
i sort of wore out um that and uh just oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting exhausted and uh it was just so demanding and we did not know as a community how to let all up so i had to i had to i had to withdraw another thing was i am very into uh mathematics and studying andmeditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was in there uh that is one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there is always people coming for four or five days and you have to and life to them in four or five days and plus we uh lived in uh uh a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant and a hardware and had a mail route and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we uh made our own bread and we uh milked a cow and so it is just plain hard physical work plus all the mental uh stuff of dealing with people is really big questions uh uh was not you know the that is reason i had to quit it was like if i could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself i would have been okay but that was not how it worked so i had to to pull back from it 

Recording: (5770/ 9621) 
i do not think it is bad because he did go to a day care when he was little before his grandmother started watching him and uh i mean it was you know you are you are got people you do not know watching your kid and that is kind of scary but you know you have got to check things out first before you put your kid anywhere 

Recording: (5771/ 9621)

Recording: (5776/ 9621) 
dorthie uh has a lot of grandchildren and a lot of children and she has six children so i think her family is her 

Recording: (5777/ 9621) 
it is probably not as you know like you know as uh convinced as a fact as like most tourist areas because it is a you know australia is a little out of the way yes you know you know spend some time to get there as you like you like you would florida or california so it is like if you want to go to the beach you do not have to say oh like a memorial day it is like forget it you know just forget it it is like but with australia at least you do not have to worry about you know fighting the tourists 

Recording: (5778/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5779/ 9621) 
uh well working on a this is a project that has been ongoing for about a year and i have voluntarily given up a lot of things i like to do and i am looking forward to catching up and music uh painting uh that sort of thing

Recording: (5781/ 9621) 
yeah we have kind of broken our fat thank goodness the counter stuff 

Recording: (5782/ 9621) 
today is society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would talking talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing our uh uh early life uh we did not even know what our nickel or our dime was uh those that was unimportant and we also were talking about how uh how we uh went uh uh he was telling me a little bit by then i said let me stop you paul i said paul what kind of shoes did you wear uh in the summer he see we did not wear any shoes uh-huh and then i told him how we did not either i came from a very large family uh mostly boys we would uh take our show shoes off as soon as the year uh as we could in the springtime we would uh store them in tallow and jars of talller tyler is uh lambsard if you want to call it that and that was a conservative and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year would have been november we would take those shoes out and depending upon who is footed those shoes those would be the person it would not be the the one who had worn them in the spring because he is growing and in the meantime and uh and it may go to another another and i can remember we passed shoes down as many as four we children now my dad also repaired shoes he repaired shoes he caught our hair what today that would be the most horrible thing is some of the kids that well i need me a pair of uh i do not know whether you want advertising on here or not but it is not i i want a nike i want a rock or i want a guess uh those that is pure luxury no needs at all but today is society 

Recording: (5783/ 9621) 
just columbus is getting to big for what it is i mean that is why you have high crime rate high population population is number one and uh let us say pretty soon if they do not cage it up a little bit you know just have enough residence for the area instead of people being homeless and you know jobless everything like that i mean i hear in new york city where it is a lot more populated it is uh getting real bad of course you probably know about that 

Recording: (5784/ 9621) 
yeah we could actually we use the grandby library they have a really good library there and a large selection of videos and they have story time things where they read to the kids and get them interested in books and you know different type of things where you can win things for reading amount of books 

Recording: (5785/ 9621)

Recording: (5786/ 9621) 
that is right they just said they just asked at the wrong way

Recording: (5795/ 9621) 
in the 

Recording: (5796/ 9621) 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that is another problem it seems like the way the financial world has come up and everything else the way the cost of living has increased it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a half way decent life and be able to do some of the extra things no one wants to live and only have to be able to just use like you said well i the necessities 

Recording: (5797/ 9621)

Recording: (5823/ 9621) 
yes um i never read it

yeah 

Recording: (5827/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5828/ 9621)

Recording: (5831/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5832/ 9621) 
right they look at more what you have to say than your clothes and that that was a something i remember them talking about too you do not want them to look at what you are what you are wearing and that is mostly that was a good thing for the dress code 

Recording: (5833/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5834/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (5835/ 9621)

Recording: (5838/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5839/ 9621) 
divority yeah 

Recording: (5840/ 9621) 
um which i am so happy for because she did not she stayed a little bit more with her kids but she never did again like yeah she she was just by herself for like years and years she is fifty now 

Recording: (5841/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5842/ 9621) 
yeah i hope we are going to get there 

Recording: (5843/ 9621) 
get away from it all yeah yeah so um i came down here because he knew where my parents lived and plus columbus was a lot more opportunity 

Recording: (5844/ 9621) 
um well i have found that that i mean everyone has people from outside the united states have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone those stereotypes dissipate um i mean i actually had a conversation very similar to just the other night with a couple of germans that i met at a coffee house um i mean the the stereotype that most americans have of germans are those of bavarian uh and not real bavarian but stereotypical bavarian uh beer drinking brought worth eating sour crowd eating later hose wearing uh you know 

Recording: (5845/ 9621) 
until i track the school 

Recording: (5846/ 9621) 
do you really somebody says you can like walk up there is like some sort of stair case and you can actually walk up to her head if you really if you really want to go up and walk up to through her head you can do that 

Recording: (5847/ 9621) 
yeah and since it is not um sponsored officially by the um university they can do whatever they want and they do not have any uh possibility of um i am looking for a word here uh repercussions 

Recording: (5848/ 9621) 
i have been some places where some men refused to sweat with women sometimes i felt kind of weird about it 

Recording: (5849/ 9621) 
i am a senior 

Recording: (5850/ 9621) 
i can not 

Recording: (5851/ 9621) 
um-hum so uh it is uh an adjustment to get back into it but but i i do like it up there better as far as uh possibilities of uh working closer to home and stuff and have not enjoyed uh about a bus and 

Recording: (5852/ 9621) 
they like the oh they all like the people on crock of dials and deep and they just no they just like 

Recording: (5853/ 9621) 
i think for the most part of people can handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more like more the generations today or whatever like basically anyone not at the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it would cause any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (5854/ 9621) 
it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unique things 

Recording: (5855/ 9621) 
because they have done away with uh civil service step raises which were wrong because i could have done a crummy job and got the same raises doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times given the raises and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (5856/ 9621) 
and there is like nothing in it and uh you know it is like go down the list that is what i do he just thinks i automatically know him a mind reader that is what it is 

Recording: (5857/ 9621) 
i am very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it is because mom was home and you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it does not have to be mom i mean um you know mom can go work and dad can stay home and there is nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad there everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they have had a really bad day and something is really bothering them they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it is like how how school 

Recording: (5858/ 9621) 
you know i mean so it is true um with different pets 

Recording: (5859/ 9621) 
hm 

Recording: (5860/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5861/ 9621) 
yeah because of the traffic but see where i live i could get on the bus if i just wanted to go downtown real bad 

Recording: (5862/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5863/ 9621) 
it is due just summer second but she is already dialating and everything so the doctor had said before thanksgiving he thanks you know 

Recording: (5864/ 9621) 
i do not know all the names of it 

Recording: (5865/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5866/ 9621) 
i was only about fifteen years old i am going like what the hell is this what is going on i mean i did not know who was president in but you know i knew that there is a couple people 

Recording: (5867/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5868/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5869/ 9621) 
uh i have always had an interest in german history and also in eastern european history and i mean it seemed to be a natural way that i could tie those two together for a thesis 

Recording: (5870/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5871/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5872/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5873/ 9621) 
i had three uh they are all growing up and have kids of their own i have grandchildren from that age 

Recording: (5874/ 9621) 
but he he he is 

Recording: (5875/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5876/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (5877/ 9621) 
and i mean it is it is a easy to spell it is easy to say and you know you can children it to m or 

Recording: (5878/ 9621) 
um well actually i wanted to learn more about it i felt like like i really have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it and maybe pick up like uh 

Recording: (5879/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5880/ 9621) 
or 

Recording: (5881/ 9621) 
uh which which the the as far as the the 

Recording: (5882/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5883/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5884/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5885/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5886/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5887/ 9621) 
i experienced it well uh um in some of our ceremony you know uh this is confident no one else is going to see this because i do not want to um i do not want to have any that is printed or anything you know it uh 

Recording: (5888/ 9621) 
yeah gotten to a situation where you really there is a no wind situation from the get go and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became a political war or something like that 

Recording: (5889/ 9621) 
not in my lifetime you would have to probably be a closet gay 

Recording: (5890/ 9621) 
well that is just it that is part of it because like i see my parents would not come my mother used to try to come to things at school but i would be in different things and and i really did a pretty but my father would not he just she would say well you know he just does not like that kind of thing i mean i would be in a sunday spelling i would be in a he he does not well too damn bad get your butt down there and pretend like you like it and so you know with our and my husband is the same way his family was his father died when he was nine he was like the adult in this family he came from a buffalo new york working class he left he never looked back either and so it is kind of like you and i are both people always think say you know how we are such i i i do not know we get the schools are always so grateful to us because we organize the state test tournaments he started the baseball league for the building you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids lives and to go to i mean he coaches baseball he coaches you know um basketball we do not miss anything you know it does not matter what it is 

Recording: (5891/ 9621) 
when 

Recording: (5892/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5893/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is 

Recording: (5894/ 9621) 
no because some kids still stop at my house 

Recording: (5895/ 9621) 
she does a really wonderful job because she has the flare for interior design and so that you know presents itself in her the way she sets everything up in the store so it is very attractive 

Recording: (5896/ 9621) 
yeah i have been through i did not really know anything heart attack ate too much that good stuff 

Recording: (5897/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5898/ 9621) 
uh basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 

Recording: (5899/ 9621) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go there 

Recording: (5900/ 9621) 
so that like that is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (5901/ 9621) 
first year finishing it up oh yeah oh it is definitely the the beginning 

Recording: (5902/ 9621) 
and so uh my parents retired here let us see they have been here i do not know four or five years maybe 

Recording: (5903/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5904/ 9621) 
um and it is really it is like uh it is just different than i thought so if i come i have been a place like i should not stay and just be miserable about it 

Recording: (5905/ 9621) 
jerry i mean jerry springer 

Recording: (5906/ 9621) 
thinking about journalism um design 

Recording: (5907/ 9621) 
my god 

Recording: (5908/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5909/ 9621) 
my sisterinlaw is one of them she is just too stupid 

Recording: (5910/ 9621) 
because we said now that he will need that someday i would never have done it 

Recording: (5911/ 9621) 
tied up to a fence that you know i think they deserve to die because the prisons and the overcrowding that is a whole another subject you know that it is just amazing the means so many people were in there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (5912/ 9621) 
oh wow yeah 

Recording: (5913/ 9621) 
i do not i do not know if that is what permanates it it is very different in the public schools and the catholic school and the public school you have all the problems of society in the school you have the drugs you have the absentee parents you know the delinquency when the catholic school they just you do not have that fun thing you know it is oriented around a church even though we are not catholic it is still oriented that says there is a lot of values thepermines everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that is the way it is going to get ticked off it is the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid uh so i think that is missing and that is a problem within the school the public schools uh so there just seems to be more destruction from the educational process i mean when you are in the catholic school and you are in classroom they deal with the discipline if they need to course part of the way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it and it is harder for the teachers to teach because there is too much stuff in the way of going through and they really they are there to do 

Recording: (5914/ 9621) 
um i went to let you see i applied to emily harvard duke university of chicago and washington university so i got into three of those um they they were neat places 

Recording: (5915/ 9621) 
yeah there was you know there was no property 

Recording: (5916/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5917/ 9621) 
great 

Recording: (5918/ 9621) 
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and we could continue two operating systems um a little learning operating systems is real simple if you are playing with a computer and you screw something up the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over 

Recording: (5919/ 9621) 
i do not even know what their holidays are i i do not know 

Recording: (5920/ 9621) 
i think so too close to my mouth or 

Recording: (5921/ 9621) 
i mean i think that is the best way to address it and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who say well maybe i am married i do not know if i am married or what well hopefully they will know their true identity eventually 

Recording: (5922/ 9621) 
oh it is most of it is horribly liberal and they have always find some way to misrep present like uh kurdish 

Recording: (5923/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (5924/ 9621) 
it is going to be something good to get on your tape and they have got people over there where i work at that they will give them the days off as their cats are sick 

Recording: (5925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5926/ 9621) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no real religion and i would been going to thebyterian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something a church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i never had that before and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i would listen to eastern religions and i would listen to the joe was witnesses and and and then when i read in the book more it is just i it is a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really felt at home with us and that is why i decided 

Recording: (5927/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (5928/ 9621) 
well that is probably the rough right there 

Recording: (5929/ 9621) 
the n double a cp 

Recording: (5930/ 9621) 
i am thinking when the time comes we will just have to figure it out 

Recording: (5931/ 9621) 
and makes her look good 

Recording: (5932/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (5933/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5934/ 9621) 
i think 

Recording: (5935/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (5936/ 9621) 
well now my youngest son married a catholic girl who is from a large catholic family and their kids were going to a catholic school 

Recording: (5937/ 9621) 
well that is secret heat 

Recording: (5938/ 9621) 
it is great because he is have a used kid on my back oh yeah that is what everyone has you think 

Recording: (5939/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5940/ 9621) 
but uh then there is a lot you know that they could do with that mall too that might mean me even going want to go there more 

Recording: (5941/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (5942/ 9621) 
um i have not personally researched it but i have seen uh i would personally research it if i was president um documentaries and whatnot and things on twenty twenty which i do not wholeheartedly believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes in your out has really seemed to work in california because most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or whatnot um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yeah it costs more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and they are on the streets anymore so they do not have to catch them they do not have to process them et cetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really is in the works and really working and we really do what are going to say we are doing it instead of like little parents no i do not even do that no i do not even do that you know what i mean because i think that is part of our problem too 

Recording: (5943/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5944/ 9621) 
what is the difference way when i was a kid you did not want to be barred home by the police you are actually scared of the police nowadays what is the kid is scared of nothing 

Recording: (5945/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (5946/ 9621) 
i know that is why i would not do the hiking things i am like great i can get like a visa because i still be telling them well you know because uh some places in your league and my husband problems getting a teresa visa because sometimes they work at legal 

Recording: (5947/ 9621) 
no i have not 

Recording: (5948/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5949/ 9621) 
they say 

Recording: (5950/ 9621) 
play with him take him in on the kitchen floor so we can run around because our kitchen is like open 

Recording: (5951/ 9621) 
just carrying around a gun and shooting someone 

Recording: (5952/ 9621) 
you know it is a real worried and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough to drop them off when they were six weeks old and you are going oh jeez are we doing the right thing you know but you know some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we sit down and talk about it and we are just like i do not think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff you know and you know kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know there is no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know they are all at day care they you know and they just are not around anymore it is not the same anymore where you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so you know they have made a lot of friends through there and they still the daughter who is in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the day care so 

Recording: (5953/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (5954/ 9621) 
uh it counts if you are touching the ground or something that you are sitting on is touching 

Recording: (5955/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5956/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5957/ 9621) 
oh yeah herb 

Recording: (5958/ 9621) 
oh we have um dustin looked at beds 

Recording: (5959/ 9621) 
all right 

Recording: (5960/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5961/ 9621) 
it would be nice but no um so 

Recording: (5962/ 9621) 
i i do not care about like how me do it like my mom even wants me to do hers over a summer okay fine 

Recording: (5963/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5964/ 9621) 
an uh oh do they 

Recording: (5965/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (5966/ 9621) 
yeah and you know i i would like to have another job but i would i would love i know you will say this is really stupid but i would love to have a monday through friday eight to five job never work another evening a saturday or a sunday if if can be now i know i will probably not be able to do that because i wish she wants me to come back there so as a contractor so i do not know you know 

Recording: (5967/ 9621) 
and finally i do not know whether there are we had a paper cup of each station playing i do not know whether he is or who but anyway they finally figured that he was in a a a tunnel for the rail road 

Recording: (5968/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5969/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5970/ 9621) 
nailed over it instead of replacing the door so 

Recording: (5971/ 9621) 
uh about twelve 

Recording: (5972/ 9621) 
it was about a bunch of teenage ravers 

Recording: (5973/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5974/ 9621) 
it was columbus he went to uh fort haze 

Recording: (5975/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5976/ 9621) 
i do not nobody is worth that you know so that is what i am saying it is so retarded uh with a i do not mean to use that word in a bad way but it is ridiculous i do not put that in a bad word uh that that people have to are uh have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can not afford the legal help so i think that is wrong in this country the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right you know its land of the free all right it is a free country but it will cost you 

Recording: (5977/ 9621) 
and you know just sometimes it is just like they are like oh well she could not understand or something like that but for the most part i there is you know no weirdness he is had he had a few cousins you know make some little comments but 

Recording: (5978/ 9621) 
it is going to be a really busy day and i would the same thing at poor columbus you know i i would see all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i am like and i imagine somebody go where are the extra airplanes and they go they can not add extra airplanes it is they have certain routes they can do they just have to put bigger airplanes on but they said you know you will see larger airplanes when it is holiday time so they can put more people on so 

Recording: (5979/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5980/ 9621) 
it is better in terms of the uh city government seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they are doing and it is not oh well i will just do this it is kind of like you know there is some brains down there 

Recording: (5981/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5982/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5983/ 9621) 
uh i was over there for a couple weeks in the harbor i never sat foot on land 

Recording: (5984/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5985/ 9621) 
lived in the dorms my freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of guys i met yeah so what was different um one of the things that i really enjoyed that was different as the traffic and that really no that really that really became really became uh interesting and different for me when i started working for a career service winter quarter i took off i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a career service because i needed some money and i loved driving and let me tell you it is really really different driving around in the big city compared to out in the country man i mean you are flying down seventy one or seventy through town and you go as fast as everybody else is going and if they are going eighty you are going eighty and if they are going two you are going two yeah i mean my dad i brought him down to columbus a few times because my dad and i are real close and um i am driving around and i will zip in between cars and he is like i forgot what it is like living in a city because he used to live in chicago but um that is one of the things i really enjoy one of the things i do not like about living in a big city is is like but i have gotten used to but uh i do not like the fact that every time you look up in the night sky all you see is this like orange haze you can not see stars very well uh the noise i mean there is always noise i remember last year living in the dorms every morning at two thirty in the morning there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived and i lived in taylor so it is this it is it is in a t shape and the side of the building all the sounds just rolls right up the wall and this trash truck made so much stinking noise it was ridiculous every single morning at two thirty yeah i did not i i developed the i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything which is and that is that is one of the fascinating things when i go home dead silence dead silence and that is now where i have a problem sleeping because because there is no noise there is no noise i am so used to like turning my radio on and drawing out all these background sounds that i have to like have music on in the room so and not down here um yeah yeahum yeah nine thirty ten oclock and it all starts up at nine thirty ten oclock here in columbus and that is so i love going out club in that like two oclock in the morning um red zone red zone we usually they open up at nine or ten oclock depending on if they got a special show coming in or not but that is the place i really like going um they uh they are open till usually two thirty two oclock all depends um also found something fascinating um i uh came to columbus and you know raised in this really really really conservative extremely christian religious community of ashland and i came to columbus and i started meeting you know i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals and i have found some of the most fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals um and they are not nearly they are not the the the evil people that that everybody back home in our community always said they were you know it is just like these are normal people you know i may not agree with what they are doing but they are normal people and i have met some really cool people who are who are homosexuals and that we where that was going was um we went to access which is uh one of the home it is one of the gay um uh dance clubs in columbus it is um it is on high street it is down in uh it is down in the german bill it no it is not out of the 

Recording: (5986/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (5987/ 9621) 
you know they want to be judges like everybody else but i you know i think um they have so many different ideas and not that either one of them is right but still um i i think there is always gonna barrier their they are just kids are just not all kids are gonna get along you know i mean 

Recording: (5988/ 9621) 
my background 

Recording: (5989/ 9621) 
and you know you have a hard thing there but then if you teach the teachers that they are not going to be quiet and they are not going to you know um look at this flatter 

Recording: (5990/ 9621) 
we have not been there in a while but i mean we do go 

Recording: (5991/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5992/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (5993/ 9621) 
and so it it is the thing is though it is almost like i am really glad that willing to say i just can not make this he let he let my daughter who is thirteen he left left her at the movies one night they went to the movies they was no um the movie they went to see was sold out the next one was not going to start until nine thirty which means this kid is twelve years old so that would have been eleven thirty twelve you know athletics he leaves her there with one of her friends some boy and although just tom boy who is just amazing but so anyhow he left her there and they said they called me but i i was around the sleeper sitting here at home so after there and he said that she was going to call back you know at at a certain time and i was going to tell her what she could or could not do so i said you know we are going to have to come home you know he is going to have to come and get you oh come on no we are not going to do that i you know he can not be this late so he went back down picked them up and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 

Recording: (5994/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (5995/ 9621) 
bye 

Recording: (5996/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5997/ 9621) 
yeah yeah um-hum 

Recording: (5998/ 9621) 
you know you know i mean 

Recording: (5999/ 9621) 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think the does that a lot to do with changing our younger generation in a way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that is why they are having more shootings in schools and uh i the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them there is too much insanity there is too much sex there is too much just do what i want i got to do my own thing that is why i was not going to do i was not want to do my own thing start he says with the women is feminine movement so and it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it uh because after all of my speaking up and they want to do things in my well i will be in front of you or no um 

Recording: (6000/ 9621) 
there is the ones that will get out there with the pickup signs and the race hell okay 

Recording: (6001/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6002/ 9621) 
yeah exactly and it is just it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way and i do think uh access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (6003/ 9621) 
because they are so stylishish 

Recording: (6004/ 9621) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time um and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh i think some the age that gets tempered a little bit but still tend to be a little more liberal and it is uh you know it does not matter who i vote for they are going to lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was interesting but our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion anything we wanted to uh but you know she would stop i forgot to point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that it was long after i left home actually before i realized that not everybody is that way not everybody wants to hear your views um so i particularly around my inlaws they are very conservative of southern ohio uh raised during the depression uh in a depressed area so it i learned my motherinlaw took any time he disagreed with her as a personal attack owner so i just learned just not to say anything yeah uh my fatherinlaw was not that way but my motherinlaw was 

Recording: (6005/ 9621) 
very different uh there just been a lot of innovations 

Recording: (6006/ 9621) 
um i mean back to the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no affect on the kids because they should still be uh normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (6007/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6008/ 9621) 
um well because my cousins and uh they all have uh they are very you know well educated they are more affluent and i think that uh maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 

Recording: (6009/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6010/ 9621) 
he found out he could just move yeah so you know he always got away from that 

Recording: (6011/ 9621) 
oh you have to nowadays you know i do not understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just does not happen now now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing forty hours a week too so it is it is work and it is a full time job and they start to shoot the seven year old is here it is the end of the year second grade she brings home this project going to have to have a book report you have three books with reference you know she is never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long you know getting this information out of her you know she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on it she is going to have to stand up in front of the class and make a box with a display in it and i said second grade this seems more like you know sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids you know i can not believe in second grade we were already writing curse already that is all she writes in now i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe you might be learning something yeah she is in fractions she is doing fractions she is doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one too you know and saying granted it just seems like they are three years ahead so 

Recording: (6012/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6013/ 9621) 
next afterward 

Recording: (6014/ 9621) 
so i do not know just lucky 

Recording: (6015/ 9621) 
um-hum and then they end up okay anyway that is good 

Recording: (6016/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6017/ 9621) 
well yeah we got broken into i think twice and stuff got stolen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into the gas life and pretty much everybody around there is been uh criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (6018/ 9621) 
you know so it is it is kind of the mentality my parents did okay without it then i do not need it 

Recording: (6019/ 9621) 
whoa 

Recording: (6020/ 9621) 
you know how far they held responsible i do not know you would have to go on a case by case basis 

Recording: (6021/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6022/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6023/ 9621) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged to him but i decided to 

Recording: (6024/ 9621) 
i am getting i am getting so upset 

Recording: (6025/ 9621) 
huhuh huhuh 

Recording: (6026/ 9621) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like they said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condem it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6027/ 9621) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (6028/ 9621) 
i i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but you know but it is i i do not like it as well as columbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university yeah yeah 

Recording: (6029/ 9621) 
just you know 

Recording: (6030/ 9621) 
but we are really overreally having to talk about that but my exwife is got family here so uh you know she comes in about two or three weeks at least out of the summer 

Recording: (6031/ 9621) 
i heard about that but the same principle applies but i am talking about just everyday things uh that uh people who you know you want to talk about children primarily uh there is no penalty anymore uh parents are scared to death uh to pick uh one up and spank them uh even with their bare hands or or to make them stand in the corner because they considered it and and go back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment uh uh a penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at janeys and janey you should not do that 

Recording: (6032/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6033/ 9621) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really good get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself when you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people they are you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then you know i think it is kind of 

Recording: (6034/ 9621) 
uh i blew a disk out 

Recording: (6035/ 9621) 
like not go out you are pretty much your tv is your entertainment for the year 

Recording: (6036/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6037/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6038/ 9621) 
when he died um i was about thirty 

Recording: (6039/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6040/ 9621) 
i know the valedictorian of harvard like in the junior class 

Recording: (6041/ 9621) 
yeah much too fast for me you know my 

Recording: (6042/ 9621) 
connecting from wires across up here or something and they are uh so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying 

Recording: (6043/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6044/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6045/ 9621) 
that um encompasses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is chaos even though it seems like it is an accident and uh there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical death and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not die you do not physically maybe you know there is no denying that but spiritual not even physical death can break that that one 

Recording: (6046/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6047/ 9621) 
and um 

Recording: (6048/ 9621) 
day and what a problem you with you with you with you and you with you had those kind of problems huh 

Recording: (6049/ 9621) 
they had this little apartment she is from india um 

Recording: (6050/ 9621) 
uh do you like that 

Recording: (6051/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6052/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6053/ 9621) 
he likes meat too 

Recording: (6054/ 9621) 
which could change 

Recording: (6055/ 9621) 
just a job that is an awesome job 

Recording: (6056/ 9621) 
i i think i think it is i think it is fair i think it should be that domestic partners should be should be covered i think there should probably be some uh 

Recording: (6057/ 9621) 
yeah we had a my mom has a friend that does all two sounds 

Recording: (6058/ 9621) 
do you think that we would be ready 

Recording: (6059/ 9621) 
you know he had had 

Recording: (6060/ 9621) 
and it is 

Recording: (6061/ 9621) 
you know when he is up at night i i have to do it my responsibility now and i mean people think that you know oh you get a lot help and they have their life they have mine 

Recording: (6062/ 9621) 
did not have it done through sierra money nothing like that and even the man that he followed for a while is sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now because he is old you know on his way out and he was a road man gave his life you know for eighty nine tribes to help them find and refined their connection with their spiritual that they would lost um because of the missionaries bringing christianity i mean um 

Recording: (6063/ 9621) 
yeah my my best friend lives in uh outside camp here and she has a lot of medical problems but huh 

Recording: (6064/ 9621) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up as as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (6065/ 9621) 
and names i uh actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she liked so they brought her uh lunch in to her and the nurse joked can only said or the aid or something well just pick a couple of names off the menu so she named them la maned and iran j lemon jello orange jello she picked lemon jello orange jello and turned them into la mancha low and orange jello denise and denise who 

Recording: (6066/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6067/ 9621) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is not insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is not insane and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh a reincarnation the law costs an effect and if a person murders somebody they need they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their uh their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that hardened criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (6068/ 9621) 
to get them thinking about it and then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (6069/ 9621) 
do not say oh well your son is going to be gay he is two right now let us you know change this so it so it does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (6070/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (6071/ 9621) 
you can not you can not be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (6072/ 9621) 
right the same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the house they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody else had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situation is got that way but i do believe that the older people including our government people and everybody at the top has to set the example and stick with the 

Recording: (6073/ 9621) 
as he was speaking and and as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (6074/ 9621) 
oh uh-huh 

Recording: (6075/ 9621) 
now that was up to age and so forth well i that is that is the family but uh i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values but but but good values i do not care whether they are older or new but good values and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system uh starting in the elementary right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses uh that uh devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and uh uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values uh i could even still go to first of seeing chemistry or bottomary or psychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and i will help then terminate the into our society and but it is got to start back here at the first and i think 

Recording: (6076/ 9621) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a bureaucracy 

Recording: (6077/ 9621) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (6078/ 9621) 
that that is what is making these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (6079/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6080/ 9621) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (6081/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6082/ 9621) 
in english 

Recording: (6083/ 9621) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing what is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (6084/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6085/ 9621) 
for example so you should name her camer 

Recording: (6086/ 9621) 
i have just the same opinion i think most people have us as tv 

Recording: (6087/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (6088/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6089/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6090/ 9621) 
potch never been uh never been associated with any kind of a crime that were some a violent crime 

Recording: (6091/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6092/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6093/ 9621) 
then you have a choice there you would not necessarily uh have you should have had more selfcontrol and not have the child do not expect me to pay for your uh lack of uh will power that is that is a selfish attitude that is stealing as well 

Recording: (6094/ 9621) 
i see no i mean it it 

Recording: (6095/ 9621) 
in a way yeah i think that would be good yeah maybe a new name 

Recording: (6096/ 9621) 
well you know the crime you can not really stop and other things that happen just you know too much partying around and i mean that is why i left well if i had a new because i could not you know but you know just everybody all the neighbors being loud and everything my mom is older so she can not really put up with any of that and 

Recording: (6097/ 9621) 
i have just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it is not usually what i consider news it is a lot of human interest stories and things like that which 

Recording: (6098/ 9621) 
ex really and it is bizarre 

Recording: (6099/ 9621) 
um i do not know i mean i i i like florida just because it is not cold and it is it is really nice but it rains a lot i mean and i would rather live out west because it is like a dry heat as opposed to being i mean it is nice that it is ninety degrees but it is not nice this like ninety percent humidity i mean that is kind of that kind of sounds but um it is just different to live in florida and how you think of florida being as real different like um i like it because kind of it is just that the drivers are not so insane like they are here like people are a little bit more laid back just because like um i do not know and parts of it is really insane but like sometimes just people are just like because it is all because it is nice weather people do not get so like aggravated by like here it is like cold and and gray and you just want to like yellow people in their car and stuff or something i do not know i do not know if people is deal with 

Recording: (6100/ 9621) 
basically because the plans which the utilities had for our location they could not provide to us because of the uh the best you are ruling so we had to go out and um do our own surveys become self educated through uh courses uh through att and through purdue university it was and they go you had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group but um the projects basically we were going from a uh putting together a network itself and uh we had uh you i think a part line system what do you call it daytie chain in the industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get onto a data network and uh we got down to the point where we went to a spoke network where everyone had a kid hype 

Recording: (6101/ 9621) 
well i have been the child was not much i my being here and my daughter being here i did not really have the uh time with her that i wished i would have had you know but uh uh her mother you know did her all right and everything but i always thought i would have been more involved in our growing up and i think two people families are generally better you know for not necessarily living and being a lot you know being married and everything but 

Recording: (6102/ 9621) 
shun and yeah uh-huh um um we do not have enough sex problems sure we could do the 

Recording: (6103/ 9621) 
yeah my brother is well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones that i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (6104/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6105/ 9621) 
uh uh was not anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so 

Recording: (6106/ 9621) 
yeah like a lot of people like i do not i do not know why a lot of people go but like with a lot of people i know it is like go to hear really good music and like it is amazing like what happens you know like people together and like people dancing together you look out and everybody is dancing you know i like the music is really good and everybody is really into it and working 

Recording: (6107/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6108/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6109/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6110/ 9621) 
most people i associate with in this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (6111/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6112/ 9621) 
but you know that thereing goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean obviously this pork it you know apparently was so miserable on his lap that he was going down the stairs in the basement to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his noriega or whatever you know and uh and his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (6113/ 9621) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalty that you run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids have the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6114/ 9621) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (6115/ 9621) 
the he did not 

Recording: (6116/ 9621) 
yeah so and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (6117/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6118/ 9621) 
yes i do uh about i try to visit at least uh at least two every two years we either we go to new york or we meet halfway couple years ago we met at penn state and uh so you know the older ones are all dying off though so 

Recording: (6119/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6120/ 9621) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (6121/ 9621) 
oh it is just so the environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships and uh you know i think it is a friend much friendliest place and then i i just think the vibration are higher out there you just do not have poverty well if anybody is in poverty in oregon it is because they have chosen to live a simple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregon is not that great but you know they say in new gee that even the workers have phd is well the the uh the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (6122/ 9621) 
are there other important roles where were those nuns be where was your mother is income is there for her and they had a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (6123/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it but if you are going to play it at me you know six times in three hours 

Recording: (6124/ 9621) 
i heard something the other day that really it really upset me i was at a this convention downtown convention center and uh one of the ladies that was presenting one of the work shops as a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear your writing to a person who is in the eighth grade 

Recording: (6125/ 9621) 
that is great 

Recording: (6126/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6127/ 9621) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so i am i am working for a research firm just for the convenience of the hours i i wanna go back into the nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eight hour shift and uh i do not think that we are ready for that yet he is a teacher um-hum he works at a high school yeah he teaches ninth and tenth graders no i do not think that at all i would be deceiving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about them i am just like oh my gosh i can not believe all of the the things that these kids are experiencing i did not know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about that when i was that age and it is kind of scary 

Recording: (6128/ 9621) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot a animal or shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they i know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money did not have any food they would not kill some animals and gave it to them and i do not have a problem with that uh uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charleston has to him tell us it 

Recording: (6129/ 9621) 
i think my grandpa goes to church 

Recording: (6130/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6131/ 9621) 
i mean 

Recording: (6132/ 9621) 
and he travels all over the state of ohio 

Recording: (6133/ 9621) 
oh wow 

Recording: (6134/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6135/ 9621) 
and unfortunately uh they did not really prove anything except for the day that death is final 

Recording: (6136/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6137/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6138/ 9621) 
you you why be doing eight children now 

Recording: (6139/ 9621) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (6140/ 9621) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is pretty decent person i mean i do not think that there is anything violent or there is anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focus is on the ones that are out of control and makes a big deal of those are the ones that are out of control and i think that is sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high schools like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that 

Recording: (6141/ 9621) 
but i mean like if test scores are identical and have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (6142/ 9621) 
because i do not know it just was like if i get pregnant and i get pregnant they you do not know of what you really have to go through of having a baby you know because i guess i really did not care if uh if i got pregnant or if i got pregnant it did not it did not really you know register in my mind that this you know not ruin but it was it will change your whole life 

Recording: (6143/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6144/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6145/ 9621) 
yeah and it just did not work 

Recording: (6146/ 9621) 
it is in northern ohio it is near illeria which is west of cleveland 

Recording: (6147/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6148/ 9621) 
and i know that in my case i will use a personal case i will use frank my older son uh well the ones i am speaking of the one the boys are going on seventeen the one little girl just turned eleven the other one turned eight well they go over to the one grandparents house and she has a habit of paying them for little jobs that her own house so i think only when they come to my house 

Recording: (6149/ 9621) 
and uh the second tornado it was not as bad i mean it was we was driving up after he uh ripped me off and he said well i am taking your sorry ass back to columbus and i said okay go for it and just sitting there smiling all the way up knowing knowing what he did not know we get to tennessee and uh you know weather is kind of bad there too i am like hey man slow down you know you do not have any wind chill wafers in the middle of this rain storm 

Recording: (6150/ 9621) 
girls i have never seen them take a guy out of a bar 

Recording: (6151/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6152/ 9621) 
uh they more or less buy a dog for a token 

Recording: (6153/ 9621) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special ed certificate you are sort of find kindergarten through twelve so i did several years in the high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary well my kids were in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that i am too old to keep up with these kids not only are they learning disability in eighty d but they are middle schoolers and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies you can not tell which is the hormones and which is the he d d and which is the learning disability but like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through that 

Recording: (6154/ 9621) 
i think it is better probably if the do not let me say anything about you know and most of the people you know like when you get to i lived in a barics a whole time but i mean you know a lot of people you know they get their own places off base you know and who cares what they do not i mean i do not care yeah like i say i have any gay friends that you know i do not care what they do i mean they are old enough to do whatever else they want to do you know 

Recording: (6155/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6156/ 9621) 
short north short north but um it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird um you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you got to access you do not get hit on my girls you get hit on my guys i dance with low sticks and i have had i had like seven guys come up to him and one night and there is like can can you can you do that for me 

Recording: (6157/ 9621) 
oh we have fun 

Recording: (6158/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6159/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6160/ 9621) 
yeah he wants to teach his he likes football and he wants to coach football but you have to teach to do that so 

Recording: (6161/ 9621) 
here uh and now that is the most news worthy story out there so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it the media 

Recording: (6162/ 9621) 
um it is an eo trip that is all it is basically like what i can do this 

Recording: (6163/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6164/ 9621) 
oh my gosh it was it was it was just unbelievable he got really sick after that rush week yeah really sick so they wanted to move in the fraternity house he can not really afford it but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he is like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so i am thinking they might help them out a little bit they want him in the house real bad 

Recording: (6165/ 9621) 
basically uh it is just the talk and stuff it is not uh like you know what i mean i am black i am better or i am white i am better it is it is none of that 

Recording: (6166/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6167/ 9621) 
gone downhill a lot 

Recording: (6168/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6169/ 9621) 
and it is if you know any teenagers it is more strict you make it more they rebel 

Recording: (6170/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6171/ 9621) 
i you know from my perspective which is skewed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it with that situation 

Recording: (6172/ 9621) 
so if you if you you could not bring any any like pets but say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the states you have to leave all those 

Recording: (6173/ 9621) 
well we we went in at napers 

Recording: (6174/ 9621) 
nope huhuh 

Recording: (6175/ 9621) 
oh well we really want to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was the and when he was fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i have been to school and after he works for a little while and i work in so that we can have enough money and i mean we do not need to have the time but we just should be at least a little out of debt yeah something 

Recording: (6176/ 9621) 
it is just 

Recording: (6177/ 9621) 
so i am like 

Recording: (6178/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (6179/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6180/ 9621) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her and actually her brother is a fellow fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know them all that well but uh apparently her family i mean she is she is double major history and chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it painfully clear that when that she should not plan on having a career because that she is going to have to raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my belief and and the fact that it is like the males telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think an individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that is sort of going out hoping it is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh i think we have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticize the advance 

Recording: (6181/ 9621) 
but when he did have something to do with them it was kind of strange they would go out and whistling girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (6182/ 9621) 
the big things 

Recording: (6183/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6184/ 9621) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (6185/ 9621) 
they 

Recording: (6186/ 9621) 
well the main thing is they never leave they do not they go lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest gpa of any college 

Recording: (6187/ 9621) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a million or without the lawsuits of different yeah experience with uh sexual harassment 

Recording: (6188/ 9621) 
oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months and uh and uh i went to the produce stand and i took my umbrella and of course it does not rain too much in california and i said oh i am from oregon and i always think it is going to rain and he says well i am from washington and i know it is going to rain 

Recording: (6189/ 9621) 
so if you want to get to me to where men if you can not be a piece are not there other important quote unquote roles for women in the church are not there other important roles 

Recording: (6190/ 9621) 
on the spur of the moment i would have to think about that i really would 

Recording: (6191/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (6192/ 9621) 
it is like hitting me i am just i am not sure you can tell me if it is not anywhere near my mouth 

Recording: (6193/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6194/ 9621) 
yeah i i want to have to um do it 

Recording: (6195/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6196/ 9621) 
yeah the me exposure the me exposure 

Recording: (6197/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6198/ 9621) 
did not like it huh 

Recording: (6199/ 9621) 
like you are doing interviews 

Recording: (6200/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6201/ 9621) 
right right right 

Recording: (6202/ 9621) 
yeah and then you know then i will show that summer gun you know i will i will shoot in you know uh like you know the guys that were supposedly picking them i do not even know whether they even shot him in but uh but yeah i think they kind of just thought you know like i you know i will i will prove to them that you know they can not push me around 

Recording: (6203/ 9621) 
but north and mall is where i do go shopping 

Recording: (6204/ 9621) 
what the hell am i doing here 

Recording: (6205/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6206/ 9621) 
i think i would say the same thing because um of course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving i mean i think i learned a lot from her selflessness and uh 

Recording: (6207/ 9621) 
why is that 

Recording: (6208/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6209/ 9621) 
in what way 

Recording: (6210/ 9621) 
no uh what what really um what when aids started i had uh a one of my best friends a brother had died of it and that and that really after that i like told you know was like i have to work on them because i was scared to death to get aids you know so i did work on them you know probably after a few years of having sex with alzheimer but 

Recording: (6211/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6212/ 9621) 
i have been playing video game since i was two so 

Recording: (6213/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6214/ 9621) 
um it is magnified and and or yeah they have that choice they can say well listen you do not understand and blah blah blah now i have tried that but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listening uh i hear what you are saying but i am trying to show you that uh and tell you how i work best so as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedom and give me goals of what you want to accomplish and give me the freedom to accomplish them the way that i can do it uh not by quotas and headlines and crap like that um i can show you what to do and that is that is the struggle in memory right now trying to find employment where people will company some slack you know and i wanted to do some driving but you know uh because at least out on the road you know i do not put up with anyone is crap but long driving long distances is not good for me focusing and concentrating um and i i have had you know several accidents several tickets um so i mean i have even had uh you know two other head injuries 

Recording: (6215/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6216/ 9621) 
but i can certainly i can certainly see that and that is a i think that you know a lot of a lot of people feel like too he is he is he is one of us you know he is like he is like we are kind of thing well michigan it is a time your mandatory jail time something so you get caught with it and you go can it all 

Recording: (6217/ 9621) 
and that is pretty much the way i felt the whole day because i was just smiling on the inside 

Recording: (6218/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6219/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6220/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6221/ 9621) 
and the battle had fallen timbers here is my rough draft would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i will get a good grade see i i tell them i said that is what i am here for you know i am here to help you use me to help you get better grades use me to run interference if you think you know the science but you are getting marked down because you can not spell the words let me know i will go talk to your science teacher tell her not to count your spelling or not you know not to make you take the test without the little spell checker thing that is in your book bag to let you use that i mean i do a lot of um what i call advocating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that do not understand i go in and i say well you know this is kind of a long test could he maybe take half today and half tomorrow or would you mind if he came out to my room ninth period during study hall because i have a free period and i could like kind of monitor it and and read the words he does not know so that he is actually answering what the question really says instead of what he thinks it says so that you will not be testing his reading ability but you will really be testing whether he knows about magnetism 

Recording: (6222/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (6223/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6224/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6225/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6226/ 9621) 
yeah and then uh i went to work before that and i just i had to walk from hillyard one day through matter of fact through this twelve seventy stretch right there 

Recording: (6227/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6228/ 9621) 
to get them to do what they do to even to help like blind people or to um help people that have other physical disabilities um you you can tell from the way the dog is in terms of uh with with the the way the dog behaved with the person that has the disability uh that they have been trained for um you can tell whether they have been trained the right way or whatever so i thought about that but you know um uh you know i have not given much more than you know just the thought but you know i looked at the veteran assistant and i went in there and it was not uh you know i was there just for half a day and you know they were telling me about some of these people out there that uh you know i do not understand the law again but you know there is people out there that will draw out and they will buy a dog you know a nice dog and uh because they do not want to make the time to train it and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time and discipline and love and care just like a child 

Recording: (6229/ 9621) 
thats right 

Recording: (6230/ 9621) 
yeah course you know babies tend not to be on on time so 

Recording: (6231/ 9621) 
still on but um 

Recording: (6232/ 9621) 
and then she is the one that i will be hearing you know you do not know what they are like about black ass and all this you know they are prejudice and all she is doing is yelling about being they are prejudice against her because what she do not understand has her damn job 

Recording: (6233/ 9621) 
you are much bigger and you can control the thing and keep it away from her uh yeah but but i do not know what somebody else told me what they can watch and not watch that is my job but i do not know how i mean it the media supposedly i mean he may not supposedly it is maybe a way at work the media presents the stuff and people watch it or read it or whatever they do not but it is fun it is like the constant garage that this is what you get the monoch love wimpski stuff and everyday there is a new twist on this story that where they now the news was that there was not a news twist yeah i do not care but you could not turn it off because that is all that was on 

Recording: (6234/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6235/ 9621) 
yeah yeah so it is kind of and that that and the university knows that is going on so 

Recording: (6236/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6237/ 9621) 
and so yeah but it is just uh god out of control 

Recording: (6238/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6239/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6240/ 9621) 
that is good 

Recording: (6241/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6242/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6243/ 9621) 
two years 

Recording: (6244/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (6245/ 9621) 
the city just cannot believe 

Recording: (6246/ 9621) 
and uh you know it is oh you got our we are open to that you know 

Recording: (6247/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6248/ 9621) 
yeah you know worked out fine for us 

Recording: (6249/ 9621) 
yeah that is really not something you see and where things can 

Recording: (6250/ 9621) 
uh but see his father lived right around the corner and never even had nothing to do with them 

Recording: (6251/ 9621) 
i mean soon like fed ex and all that it is probably going to be there is probably going to be no one working there they are probably going to make it all machinery you know 

Recording: (6252/ 9621) 
which is pretty well to theirself they and they went up through the mountains we did not see well went up to uh see now well we went uh about halfway up to between soaps room 

Recording: (6253/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6254/ 9621) 
i do not know anything about it but he he lived in um poke which is um i think it is near santa barbara but we have talked about la i do not know anything i have heard terrible things about it but 

Recording: (6255/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (6256/ 9621) 
i at this point i blame it on the administration umi mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levy you should never defeat a school levy 

Recording: (6257/ 9621) 
i makes it hard like if you got like if like you and you got a family you know you know you take you if you want to you want to like spend an eye on the town with your you know with your family man that is that kind of blows your whole budget for the year 

Recording: (6258/ 9621) 
yeah they will just take one script and they will expand it um and and they will just run with that one script and then they are also churches that will just in their minds they will in their minds they will delet certain sections of the script that they do not like first christian is chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gets like healing people and and um the extremely taboo um religious topic among a lot of churches is the gift of tongue whether it is dead whether it is not whether it is inspired whether it is not inspired yeah theata blah blah well i had not even heard about it until i got to columbus because and and i know the bible pretty well and i had not even heard about it until i got to columbus and i get to columbus and i am like okay this is pretty cool i went home and i am talking to some people in my parents church and they are like oh yeah um we just do not really talk about that very often and i am just 

Recording: (6259/ 9621) 
yeah they just kick him to the hallway he was either you know in the hallway or in uh the office and and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions 

Recording: (6260/ 9621) 
and i could not walk at all 

Recording: (6261/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (6262/ 9621) 
you will not learn you will just sit there and follow my directions and if you do not 

Recording: (6263/ 9621) 
hecleans his 

Recording: (6264/ 9621) 
yeah we had um any not really just modest dresses you could not wear pants and it would dresses could not be ankle lengths they could not be um at the knee had to be mid mid knee or whatever that is cal and that was certain restrictions but yeah i mean basically just honest whatever i mean i wear boots with the dress in 

Recording: (6265/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6266/ 9621) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids a lot of kids are on medication today that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when we for kids in wilington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever so we refer him to those doctors and then if this those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these doctors also ask for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any or prettyable difference in two or three weeks and you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back and observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids does not face them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they bunch your growth and they sube your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headache from gets of drain and that or all so i say you know if it works you said if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because they are maybe just not able to pay attention a little bit but they are not really add and the parents are taking them in and going johnny is not getting straight a days put him on something so i guess 

Recording: (6267/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6268/ 9621) 
i like it um i have lived i have only lived in the northern end i have lived in double n and old worthington and not howard we are just kind of on the side um but i like it because it has it is own little well especially where there is into its own little city within a city 

Recording: (6269/ 9621) 
twenty years ago 

Recording: (6270/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6271/ 9621) 
well he uses it when he has like car problems or something he tends to like to drive his own car you know they have to park so far away 

Recording: (6272/ 9621) 
it is not gonna work 

Recording: (6273/ 9621) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarian but there is some for public too 

Recording: (6274/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6275/ 9621) 
i think when you have two or more pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (6276/ 9621) 
yeah it was pretty much like our middle class 

Recording: (6277/ 9621) 
no wonder if that is also a socialized medicine there it it is socialized it 

Recording: (6278/ 9621) 
which was a going thing 

Recording: (6279/ 9621) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called grads and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids 

Recording: (6280/ 9621) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (6281/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6282/ 9621) 
well they need to just strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and they made that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (6283/ 9621) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i think 

Recording: (6284/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6285/ 9621) 
a 

Recording: (6286/ 9621) 
you know what um actually i do not believe they have anything book so far lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come into their homes and things i have usually i have worked for different hotels where i have always worked on new year is eve and my husband this year is like you know but we do not even have any plans we were gonna maybe do something with some friends and they are going to california so i am not sure even exactly what i am going to do but um right now there is not an event scheduled 

Recording: (6287/ 9621) 
no really i mean different cultures and everything uh uh i i went to school with black so i mean that was not that big a thing except for the influx of the you know i i mean there were how many were being drafted or being the enlisting of the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (6288/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6289/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6290/ 9621) 
and i mean yes they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact of matters it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (6291/ 9621) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (6292/ 9621) 
they did 

Recording: (6293/ 9621) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were going to buy a house in clintville to hold them and rent them i do not have any money so i that down payment has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple condos over on bebble road for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when she was getting ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your land lady and then the wood will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was going to move out when she graduated from high school and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bond line is i i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i can afford to hang onto those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would you would be fine you would be renting you would not buy anything that you did not think you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (6294/ 9621) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (6295/ 9621) 
yeah and and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they have got their input and i think that it is just a mixture of everything 

Recording: (6296/ 9621) 
and do not insulted us anymore or we will go to trial uh some attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth to what they thought i was worth even the arthritisator was an ass hole um but uh that is the way that system works 

Recording: (6297/ 9621) 
okay uh my name is i uh i am an undergrad double major in german and history currently working on a senior honor is thesis in history i will be graduating next quarter after a grand total of six years as an undergrad uh an impressive uh somewhat disturbing six years as an undergrad uh i live in it here uh i think if it is a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which also been to of course 

Recording: (6298/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6299/ 9621) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i am thinking i may get into that 

Recording: (6300/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh it seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (6301/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6302/ 9621) 
does he 

Recording: (6303/ 9621) 
there is just too much diversity 

Recording: (6304/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6305/ 9621) 
well i lived on twelve maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but i was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couches being burned i said new are you 

Recording: (6306/ 9621) 
that was a lot of old thinking 

Recording: (6307/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6308/ 9621) 
i have seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder it is like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (6309/ 9621) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (6310/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6311/ 9621) 
um the first year they made it in state only um second the second class that they are gonna be starting to have some people from michigan i think 

Recording: (6312/ 9621) 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took him a while to catch on to things 

Recording: (6313/ 9621) 
i remember it being it was a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six when mom moved into an apartment in german village 

Recording: (6314/ 9621) 
like i know it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (6315/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6316/ 9621) 
um so i think that part definitely helps where as most of my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um or like i said i have already done all the stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (6317/ 9621) 
well that is good that is good 

Recording: (6318/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6319/ 9621) 
yeah i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (6320/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6321/ 9621) 
all by yourself 

Recording: (6322/ 9621) 
a little bit faster uh but then and then when i get out of the service i get twenty two you know it is kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleaning this and next galen just and all that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not there is just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (6323/ 9621) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just come in from my christian beliefs and whatnot the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice that they would teach you how to be confident in yourself and i do not mean like selfesteem but you know like we said if if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 

Recording: (6324/ 9621) 
and uh that is our our engineers the engineers per se but they are techies that are really into this they they enjoy their work and it is a four it is in the forefront of a high higher government along with the technology there has to always be the paperwork now i do not realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (6325/ 9621) 
um i was in more north florida or around california so that is so that is a little different i mean that is that is not that is more southern georgia basically um i do not know i mean yeah it it is not so touristy and they they are the thing where you could not have any buildings bigger than the state capitol because they did not want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially so i was really into you know it was a a different type of town like not not so many plum trees more big oak trees and stuff like that yeah it is real it is more not all of us centralized downtown it is more of a like spring out 

Recording: (6326/ 9621) 
even my mother who is uh she said if nicks were running a day she would vote for him she said much of a conservative uh agrees with what is happened but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but at this point i do not think there really was a a few months ago yeah but 

Recording: (6327/ 9621) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and pulled me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad he actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more to the next man every time we go over there he is up on the computer doing something so and i am on there you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um you know like reading about things that happen to people like their kids sitting up in their face or something 

Recording: (6328/ 9621) 
and would not you like him to see that you do not like 

Recording: (6329/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6330/ 9621) 
i do not know i saw it in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (6331/ 9621) 
it is just out of control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for you i mean they just obviously they can be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (6332/ 9621) 
i mean if i would have chosen what do you think that you should teach maybe not sex specifically but just like general rules for good living if your church is saying one thing but realistically you think maybe something a little bit different but what do you how do you think is a lot better are these type of questions because he was methodist and he chose to turn catholic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic religion and the more i was opposed to his is like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser than mine and you know who is you know um just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (6333/ 9621) 
um-hum okay 

Recording: (6334/ 9621) 
you can not see it in a 

Recording: (6335/ 9621) 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 

Recording: (6336/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6337/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6338/ 9621) 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it is not just a hot state any where you go you know it is just like i said you get excuse me you get ass holes in 

Recording: (6339/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6340/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6341/ 9621) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not shown that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes to the n a m e is you know well i am you know huh look up okay bye amy that is it 

Recording: (6342/ 9621) 
she is doing all right as far as i know she is going to the saint louis university on it do not ask me why but 

Recording: (6343/ 9621) 
but um uh one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look from molly 

Recording: (6344/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6345/ 9621) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean you know that is a broad spectrum and i know it is not all that could not ride um yeah it would have a set me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (6346/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6347/ 9621) 
uh well take for one thing when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we would wait till the surgeon went and she had and we just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out 

Recording: (6348/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6349/ 9621) 
uh-huh uh-huh 

Recording: (6350/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah yeah it is been glamorous and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not seeing somebody get shot or something and it is just like it is not really real because it is you know you can turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you know like seeing it was not real and i do not think they i do not know 

Recording: (6351/ 9621) 
yeah and it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as tourism so 

Recording: (6352/ 9621) 
yeah they like they really like this town she was from kentucky appalachia 

Recording: (6353/ 9621) 
no i do not go to mass every day but i go on sunday 

Recording: (6354/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6355/ 9621) 
um no english 

Recording: (6356/ 9621) 
but when you can not grow much of anything on it it is 

Recording: (6357/ 9621) 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the face the same as the rest of the children did but no i am i am very happy and content with her decision yeah very much so as as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsa she and her husband both baptists they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it is a yes it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what revolves from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (6358/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6359/ 9621) 
oh wow 

Recording: (6360/ 9621) 
this is the game we play every weekend it is it is uh okay game um monday night i usually come up with something dumb and things occur 

Recording: (6361/ 9621) 
we send them in and then the kids let us see the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the pay the scores back in may sometime and um some of my kids well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated 

Recording: (6362/ 9621) 
really hate that um and like affirmative action and stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it is it is just executed very poorly i mean i saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get into places i mean sit down with begging me to come 

Recording: (6363/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6364/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is huge 

Recording: (6365/ 9621) 
well when i was growing up there was not that much violence and i could go and end and i have done it now my name in on this report so you can not do nothing about 

Recording: (6366/ 9621) 
like thatyeah 

Recording: (6367/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6368/ 9621) 
why would you only you said you were in third world why would you only live in third world i would been i would not want this this country has a lot of problems it is just like my family has a lot of problems why would i am willing to have a problem leave a family why would i leave the country why not work with it and correct it because when i run away from it you know what i am doing i am running into another chaos at the other end someone has come the other direction and they have not resolved things and that is been happening our society we have not sat down to learn and understand one anotherthe other uh uh churches um i am just having a few grandchildren my husband just graduated from eight churches quite a few years ago 

Recording: (6369/ 9621) 
oh that would be awesome 

Recording: (6370/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6371/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6372/ 9621) 
just different stuff it is different every day that is why i like it just like with utah and people it is different every day 

Recording: (6373/ 9621) 
that is pretty extreme 

Recording: (6374/ 9621) 
but it fixed it 

Recording: (6375/ 9621) 
three years 

Recording: (6376/ 9621) 
it is available it is just whether they go and put forth the effort 

Recording: (6377/ 9621) 
and so uh as soon as my shop planned out that i could draw that or ninety dollars a month 

Recording: (6378/ 9621) 
was it hard 

Recording: (6379/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6380/ 9621) 
and i was born in new york 

Recording: (6381/ 9621) 
and i am saying i could take that route but it would cost me a lot of money that i do not have to get the legal defense and it would be just best for me to take the responsibility like i have and i sold the car that i had to my sister uh i am going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for uh but i am going to make them come after me you know i am going to make them come after me you know i will be uh i already went to court once and and uh well even even with the evidence being in my favor i mean it was only at this place three months i did not do any damage to it um and the walls did not need painted i was not there long enough to make them dirty uh but um their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out and my mother and i clean that thing spot with top bottom bathrooms and wash the floors and mop the floors and everything and uh their own person came through and said it rated to paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no 

Recording: (6382/ 9621) 
those are the former tv years of a child 

Recording: (6383/ 9621) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh were were not a consideration in the in oh i would say probably my first thirty maybe forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he swayed them with a position that he had developed now that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point there but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from uh uh various people within his community or whether whether you are talking about a township or a county state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then slowly then i think the finances came into play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of the day and i will leave out the the the last two years it had uh because it is because it is rather specific right now but going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i am saying even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there uh hey come on we will go to dinner we will go to this and we will do this and do this just just barely barely breaking uh the barrier but not breaking the law uh so yes very definitely progressively has changed 

Recording: (6384/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6385/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6386/ 9621) 
i i do not think anyone really affected anyone too too much as far as that goes 

Recording: (6387/ 9621) 
in a strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (6388/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6389/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6390/ 9621) 
oh yeah oh yeah it used to be when they first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 

Recording: (6391/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (6392/ 9621) 
yeah they are okay they are parents they are in their seventies now i i take what i need and leave the rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (6393/ 9621) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefited a lot from it now 

Recording: (6394/ 9621) 
i ever would have before 

Recording: (6395/ 9621) 
you know and what is the point of staying married and being miserable i think it is better to get a divorce than 

Recording: (6396/ 9621) 
family experiences 

Recording: (6397/ 9621) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing the the i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peek towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year to like their seventh where things were just like unbelievable funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season is just it is been completely outrageous story lines and like the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (6398/ 9621) 
like at at a girl things like that 

Recording: (6399/ 9621) 
well they are now in a sense um it is easier to to go somewhere else i think in the world on tv if you have you know like four news four local news channels and they are all saying the same thing and emphasize the same things there is no choice there if you want the news you are going to get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else uh and you know major newspapers are all over the web uh you can pick and choose and you can see different perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a a wider view yeah 

Recording: (6400/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6401/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6402/ 9621) 
years ago there was a citizen i do not know if you were what you were background is where you were were not here but you are not but citizen journal was a daily paper and it was it was the opposite of the diskette was much more liberal they used this it it was a morning paper and a detached was an afternoon paper evening paper and uh they shared the same facilities the same putting prices and everything and then to scratch when their lease started would not renew their lease 

Recording: (6403/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6404/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (6405/ 9621) 
i am telling you man it would not cut me slack for nothing 

Recording: (6406/ 9621) 
yeah i know oh the disney christmas it is such a shame 

Recording: (6407/ 9621) 
i do not i do not think they should i do not have any i do not you know people are okay or you know that is their business but i do not think they that is not that is not how this world was they was not put you know it was a man and a woman to start out with i do not i do not think um they should encourage that you know maybe that is a hard um topic for me to talk about because i am i do not know because i am sure there are gay boys that are not known what is going on with themselves that are in school and and i i have never really understood i do not i never really understood if they were born like that or i i am just never really understood that to tell you truth so i would not you know i would just i if i was a teacher i would just talk to talk to them and you know tell them to do whatever they feel i mean if they feel comfortable um with being like that that is fine but i do not know i i do not know if i would talk about the but maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they are like well what should i do 

Recording: (6408/ 9621) 
right uh-huh at oh yeah 

Recording: (6409/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6410/ 9621)

uh you know i do not think i have no 

Recording: (6417/ 9621) 
than it is 

Recording: (6418/ 9621) 
and that the the the people who who most face that lie are the supposed beneficialaries of civil rights legislation um so i mean civil rights was an a an important step but once that step was made it was stopped and now i believe today they are are uh i mean a a you see a growing movement of people who want to curtail the advances that were made in the sixties and it is not our generation who is curtailing it it is still the uh like our parents generation um 

Recording: (6419/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (6420/ 9621)

Recording: (6425/ 9621) 
i have no idea i remember where i was to when the colombine shooting because like my friends and i were sitting around drinking a few beers and you know we are channeled surfing and you know we see that kid fall out of the window we are like oh my god what is going on so we just left it on and it was quite like it was disturbing because i look how i was recently out of high school myself and like sure there were fights and stuff but it was always like you could avoid them or you know what i mean 

Recording: (6426/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6427/ 9621)

uh my have been oh well i am my opinion changes from day to day on uh actually at this point in time i do not know whose fault it is uh i think it is the fault of evolution well it could have been perfected but we did not know it was gonna happen that uh our society was gonna change so intensely and we kind of hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they have not and everybody is changing and especially the younger people and uh we were not ready and we did not change fast enough we did not get ready for the change that was coming 

Recording: (6433/ 9621) 
i have talked to all my family my brothers and sisters every day 

Recording: (6434/ 9621) 
back to bad buts right 

Recording: (6435/ 9621) 
not specifically no but sometimes um little groups uh sometimes if there is a college in a community when i was running a school up at campaign um we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign um but it was very difficult it was sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting you know there is certain little blocks of people uh and on school levels the people who voted no which were senior citizens i mean they they went to the polls and drove you did not have to you know the the the hope there was that they would not go to vote on the school of it uh but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (6436/ 9621) 
no no they did not um they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or searching anything so right but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job i i liked it when i did it uh i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own curriculum for it right they had a when they told me i i they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about this stick and it was only about painting 

Recording: (6437/ 9621) 
a lot of pool actually uh we go to a a bar called the outer end because it is cheap and it is fun there 

Recording: (6438/ 9621) 
and uh and that i say we went to church fairly regularly but to tell you the truth i can not remember too much that i was talking to them but uh but i was exposed to it in any way and i i am sure that some of it rubbed off on me 

Recording: (6439/ 9621) 
i know i know 

Recording: (6440/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6441/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6442/ 9621) 
and they actually offered an early retirement because the funds i do not you may not remember about three years ago four years ago the the federal government was not going to pass a budget and all the stuff so when that does not happen on budget after we cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that which is actually more money than they were gonna give us before that uh so they had to do they were have to lay off people or offer retirement so i took the retirement because i was not happy there anyway so and then took a couple months off and did some consulting was worked on a consulting project at morton is for about six months and then when that project ended just the same time and ended my fatherinlaw was diagnosed with cancer and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they do not they were from shelton so uh i became his care giver for about three months until he died and then took a couple months off and started working part time at the symphony to have been some something 

Recording: (6443/ 9621) 
texpelled

my my my thing is is you still you you try do your best on earth do the aspects that you have whether it is supposed to be a missionary fine can you say a missionary working in the office there is needs for missionary work in the office around us on the campus everyday they are talking about the versus here all you got to do is just sit down you know what was done numbers game just do not numbers game at all just learn about one another and you are gonna find out you know it i think they said the the clear blind society um that is how we got together when you are in a coma well when you are let us say you are out you can not see anything and you are doing surgery on you are you going to be you are gonna qualify well i want the surgery on that and that and that 

Recording: (6451/ 9621) 
so it is kind of hard you know what i mean to to do a lot of things 

Recording: (6452/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6453/ 9621) 
a fact to me and i can not say that 

Recording: (6454/ 9621) 
yeah and everybody has it right 

Recording: (6455/ 9621) 
so i tighten this good cool perfect 

Recording: (6456/ 9621) 
right but still my my oldest daughter for a long time she was in in theater and people said how do you feel about that i said what do you how do i feel about that you know she can always wait tables as long as she gets her port her stuff so what do i care and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology and now as it turns out she is going to um she just started back she is was having the baby though she just started back and uh to get certified to teach elementary school because we have talked so much about what would where would she do well and she she would just do so well she is really good but she is such a kid herself she is really good with with kids maybe second third grade she is so into animals and so into science and understands different kids so that you know i i think she would be fabulous there and so she is kind of decided but if that if she ends up not doing that i will not care either 

Recording: (6457/ 9621) 
the yeah 

Recording: (6458/ 9621) 
yeah you are you yeah you may be right could be could be

he was having problems with his adopted mother and he was in a an all all night restaurant and he was bragging you know that he met this man and the man took him home you know and he slept at the man took him home you know he slept at the man is place and i was telling do you know how dangerous uh you know that could have been for you and uh he thought it was cool you know so you know just things like that 

Recording: (6460/ 9621) 
i think they have tried to to bring the layman in to more of the the duties of the freeze but there is like the concentration of the bread line that that none of that has been sanctions they do not perform they do not uh uh they are not able to give the sacramento grace for baptisms for a baptinationism from within well they do holy commune but uh extra much in not a those are have been delegate outside of the duties of the priest but um i still think that it is a good i do think the involvement of the layman is very important but i do not have any i i mean that does not bother me a bit about women 

Recording: (6461/ 9621) 
if if we ran score sports i mean the game of sports not the the administration of sports is just as unethical as a business world it is unethical and it is one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we have emphasized sports along with a theater as being oh the way to go and the the the poor the poor expense marks you could have in terms of financial uh uh appreciation sure you can the thing as you market demands the uh dollar that type of thing well you know we will not do it but the thing is it gets almost be like a lawsuit case we are crazy and saying people again gets back to ethics do you think do you think i am worth thirty million dollars let me ask you let me let me ask you question why in the hell are you coming to asking for thirty million dollars do not you think you are uncooked 

Recording: (6462/ 9621)

Recording: (6467/ 9621) 
so that is like a big thing you know they are saying with northland shop it is in there closed down and all the if you go up where where i am at they got so many of them strip malls like you are talking about with stores out of them 

Recording: (6468/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6469/ 9621) 
yeah that is i mean that is really a tough one uh because it is i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer uh and you know i do not think it is violence on tv i do not think it is working parents i think it is and i do not know what it is it seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily um i i i do not know it is it is often and i mean you i mean your daughter is is daughters yeah it is still young so you had to deal with it but it is scary you send your kids to school and you hear these things and it is just no matter where it is in the country or in the world you hear of it you know it is really worries you 

Recording: (6470/ 9621) 
um freshman sophomore year yes after that i quit wrestling and i just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else sports is definitely part of a click you try to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same 

Recording: (6471/ 9621) 
oh the japanese come too 

Recording: (6472/ 9621)

Recording: (6478/ 9621) 
yeah i do not do a whole lot of it but i like to travel 

Recording: (6479/ 9621)

Recording: (6480/ 9621)

Recording: (6482/ 9621) 
the should have been in class 

Recording: (6483/ 9621) 
just i think it is uh to to affect the the um beliefs that we are trying to carry and and i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean i am not saying that it is terrible but if they have like a nose ring and all this stuff then it somebody might not believe that they have anything creditable to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more respectfully that uh you know i mean most of the people will accept you if you are dressed in a dress whereas i mean even a person that knows right will will respect you but but then you are in a you are out of disadvantage if you do not dress in a certain way 

Recording: (6484/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6485/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6486/ 9621) 
well right now i think he knows enough i am just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i am pretty i am like wow i can not even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and cars and rockets and 

Recording: (6487/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6488/ 9621) 
they they definitely struggle it they do i i think to be that high up obviously you are gonna come in contact with powerful people rich people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind that i do not i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than they are volicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (6489/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6490/ 9621) 
you should be real attentive to what is happening in his school situation his or her 

Recording: (6491/ 9621) 
so she is and hopefully they will get married soon they have been together for over a year and a half 

Recording: (6492/ 9621) 
you know why 

Recording: (6493/ 9621) 
oh lots of people travel all over uh you know i mean that is i do not lots of people do you know i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but i you know i i do ten twelve a year 

Recording: (6494/ 9621) 
and neither one of these folks could answer yes or no and they are going just answer yes or no that is how i think i stayed at my point very clearly when i was is not it the answer is yes or was it was it was um health care for livein partners um it is a simple question yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just drives me nuts that you know and i know that that from a pr standpoint you do not want to you know want to shown any people away that might vote for you because you feel like that they might you know if you are running for office you should just just be up front 

Recording: (6495/ 9621) 
i am not saying that it is not right for some people but you know it was not right for my son 

Recording: (6496/ 9621) 
oh they do like what 

Recording: (6497/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (6498/ 9621) 
too much 

Recording: (6499/ 9621) 
it really is it really is great 

Recording: (6500/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (6501/ 9621) 
and i looked at it and i got introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader than that so i ended up coming up with a class that was it was an only nine weeks to it was only nine classes um so it was about a two and a half for three hour class each week for nine weeks and uh i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly and uh visual art and for the second three weeks we talked about music and the uh development of music race aspects and for the last three weeks we talked about theater actually for the two of the last three weeks we talked about theater and for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera so for a lot of these kids you know from there was an introduction to uh there was an introduction to a lot of things that they might not have been exposed to yeah 

Recording: (6502/ 9621) 
so outer end is over i do not even know they 

Recording: (6503/ 9621) 
i see 

Recording: (6504/ 9621) 
but i am using me in the example because i have seen a lot of other people do the same thing do not get me wrong 

Recording: (6505/ 9621) 
i think that the 

Recording: (6506/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6507/ 9621) 
it is beautiful and we like going to see the ski resorts and everything i do not really ski 

Recording: (6508/ 9621) 
the catholic schools 

Recording: (6509/ 9621) 
well i yeah but let us face it the people that have the real good guns are the people that should not have the guns meaning crime and whatnot um i do not have a problem with people having guns but we do not need sixty guns per person or whatever the ratio is it something i godly like that and they keep making them and i um i mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture we did need to hunt to eat um i have friends that bow and arrow hunt i am not real big into hunting but at least they are they have to do something besides that they are in 

Recording: (6510/ 9621) 
my husband lived in a town a small town in southern ohio where the dentists in town were three brothers and they were named pain pain and pain dentists and that was spelled p a i n there is some funny name stories out there boy but people just go nuts with their kids names i just like would you wanna why would you do that to that kid carol harold 

Recording: (6511/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (6512/ 9621) 
where uh where are you from you say 

Recording: (6513/ 9621) 
i said yep i said you you caught mommy saying a bad word and you would be going to soap and your not yep so i go in the bathroom now what i always always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and i just put a little bit of soap on into her tongue well now i have been i have had falls teeth since i was about thirty two needless i had falls teeth and this kid did this and she had been about five years old going out by a room i sat down on that twelve is two when i said there i take out my tongue she takes that cake and so she does not rub my tongue she twisted it it got on my teeth and it took my always to to eat two weeks to get that soap taste off my tape no matter how i scrub needless to say if i be in to get in patient after that and i am ready to say something i am looking around the same 

Recording: (6514/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6515/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6516/ 9621) 
oh okay okay it is probably growing up and i and i have been there done that too but still you have to you have to um know there is a respect out there to be wanted and expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they saw the interaction with the elderly people the school he went to their law public involvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and their teachers are there ticket takers uh monitoring the crowd where the kids i ask them do you guys ever go home so no oh yeah i said but they are always there they are not there just teaching a class they are not there preparing the class they are there after the class they are there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people that are on the clock who trying to quit they are gone those people do not know the meaning of life but they we will never know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is having problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensated because they will be compensated not necessarily materialisticly they will be then or within an expect it they will be would come say it somewhere but the thing is to land an open hand not knowing well gee what is for what is in it for me what is in it for you is intangible are you willing 

Recording: (6517/ 9621) 
i never thought of that 

Recording: (6518/ 9621) 
but i think kids in high school and stuff some of them like my brotherinlaw is gay and when i met him i knew he was uh you know he was the type some of them he can not tell well it does not matter what they look like um but my husband said all through growing up he liked men he did not like girls he looked at magazines you know all the stuff and i thought that is so funny because grown up i just did not know know anybody that was um but you know he was openlygates his mother rights in the beginning and she was from germany which made it a little tough because you know they did not talk about the that those things over there at all for a long time but um then she became very open with them and but everybody knew and that was in the eighties and you know if some kids know it when they are young and growing up you know i do not know if it is best to not say it or to you know be open but if they are open to their parents about it then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better than than if they wait later on in their life you know but some sometimes i guess they change you know most of the men i knew right off the bat you know i mean i mean it was not it was all through their lives it was not as though they just said well i am going i am going to be gave 

Recording: (6519/ 9621) 
it is really weird is where i live at i live right by right i do not even have city water and sewer i am the only one on my side of the street i 

Recording: (6520/ 9621) 
oh boy is this kindergarten teacher going to have fun with this

Recording: (6522/ 9621) 
yeah i oh gosh seems like incredible i used to not understand what the right click on windows was i that was like when i moved in and now all of a sudden like i i i installed my own dv player in my computer like tore the case off and did it 

Recording: (6523/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6524/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6525/ 9621) 
i should have some other thing to exchange for money i would much rather exchange ideas for money or previously done work for money or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money i have been favor of that i come up with a good system by which do things they say let you you go do those things i said i want to make money off of your efforts yeah that so 

Recording: (6526/ 9621) 
but as i said i went to summer school too and 

Recording: (6527/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (6528/ 9621) 
yeah well i think chiropractors have been more popular for the same type of reason yeah 

Recording: (6529/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6530/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6531/ 9621) 
it is good money yeah um one idea that i just had recently is medical and from addison which is a person who has an md and does computers since those are my too many interests i thought doing both would be really cool 

Recording: (6532/ 9621) 
no no no but just a small independent 

Recording: (6533/ 9621) 
i was trying to avoid that question no but uh i thought you know just get a little insight on what is going on out there in delaware and you know maybe possibly find someone to be with but 

Recording: (6534/ 9621) 
i know i know there is like somebody that says well you can even go to vietnam now and i am like but why would i yeah it is like it is like yeah you know you can go can go not to cuba well why would you it is like it is it is uh uhhuhyou like going back in time if you are used to you do not like more conveniences you know like toilet and the hot water and you know oh really no they do not have like your your basic amenities my gosh really really uhhuhwhere is it atwell they like uh the but the i do not think like i thought there is like on the hospitals supposed to be like dormitories or you know just you know there they are they provide your basics but they are supposed to be like at least you know i mean you get what you pay for okay uhhuhyou know it is really nice to hang out and you know uh the sleeping area is niceokayokay uh but it is more the that was more the exception than the norm so where in europe did you go where is well actually where is you not recommend going okay 

Recording: (6535/ 9621) 
you know and they some of them spoke out where they should speak out 

Recording: (6536/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (6537/ 9621)

Recording: (6539/ 9621) 
like the continent 

Recording: (6540/ 9621) 
and as long as the wind was not too uh well they could do it i mean they fogged it up to where you could hardly see your hand out here

Recording: (6543/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6544/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6545/ 9621) 
and i think that uh the morals being you know especially at a young age you know abstinence is the best policy so many people i i think they are turning to they are not going to have anything do anything before they are married um but in today is life once you get into college and stuff it is a little hard to but i think a lot more kids are going that route um because my parents never talked to me about sex we all learned from our friends um my mother was very open but i think in today is world because really there was not there was not that many diseases i mean you know there was but you just did not hear about it 

Recording: (6546/ 9621) 
people are more scared of you than you are of that 

Recording: (6547/ 9621)

Recording: (6548/ 9621) 
uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so 

Recording: (6549/ 9621)

Recording: (6559/ 9621) 
than having executed us does now 

Recording: (6560/ 9621)

you know they talk about drinking from the fount and now they are only gargling they are not drinking much by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they are pretty savvy these days they are not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do 

Recording: (6586/ 9621)

Recording: (6587/ 9621) 
you know there is things about my dad but and i were in a little of a with with and and he i used to great and he is wonderful to me i mean my dad is really wonderful to me but i mean things like like when my mom had me he he did not pick her up from the hospital i mean it is that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 

Recording: (6588/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6589/ 9621) 
yeah i i was really glad that my son uh met you know was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because uh you know the guys are real real nice you know very it is very you know he is always kind of been like real sound offish when it comes to uh 

Recording: (6590/ 9621) 
i like that ask me i mean i do not know i do not pay attention to who the writers are um so maybe the writing has changed 

Recording: (6591/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah 

Recording: (6592/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6593/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah so 

Recording: (6594/ 9621) 
you know it is you know 

Recording: (6595/ 9621) 
uh i was a little bit on the past side yeah i 

Recording: (6596/ 9621) 
well i do not know the people that i see around uh you know they are grownups 

Recording: (6597/ 9621) 
middle 

Recording: (6598/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (6599/ 9621) 
right which is what we look like 

Recording: (6600/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6601/ 9621) 
okay i could not because i do not think i would know that one whatever looks pretty when it comes to 

Recording: (6602/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6603/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6604/ 9621) 
yeah which cracks me up because if you have ever looked at the parents of models they are not necessarily all that attractive 

Recording: (6605/ 9621) 
it 

Recording: (6606/ 9621) 
i know that is why you have to get it recorded it it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they are on a shoe string they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count in kind contribution that western uh ought to buy college pays for a rehearsal space our performance space and uh the salary the conductor um so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh but once in a while we will get win players playing it also and uh sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something you wanted to play 

Recording: (6607/ 9621) 
no she she still was down here my other sister has two nieces and my nephew 

Recording: (6608/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6609/ 9621) 
that is an embarrassment for a college this size 

Recording: (6610/ 9621) 
i am and they are my wife was not 

Recording: (6611/ 9621) 
it is all up to a human being if they want to change if they got their mind set on they do not want to be with you know their other sex i do not think you can change them you know that is all up to that person i think 

Recording: (6612/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6613/ 9621) 
i i have make them you know time out well now for two minutes 

Recording: (6614/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6615/ 9621) 
i do not mean kid 

Recording: (6616/ 9621)

Recording: (6620/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6621/ 9621) 
yeah yeah ever authority figures it all you know she is she is really strong about that though because um she does not look at anybody being uh you know maybe more wise or experienced in things but you know certainly she does not trust anybody 

Recording: (6622/ 9621) 
yes but you know what his parents are going you know really going to let people know that 

Recording: (6623/ 9621) 
what are the taxes are they high or 

Recording: (6624/ 9621) 
and he said do divorce more acceptable divorce should never be acceptable 

Recording: (6625/ 9621) 
kids because they are only little ones that is what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated they are only little ones and they will be grown up before i know it because 

Recording: (6626/ 9621) 
right i did not need to so i did not want to um 

Recording: (6627/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6628/ 9621) 
and i do have a brother 

Recording: (6629/ 9621) 
would you hold it 

Recording: (6630/ 9621) 
and just get out there and have fun and then like we left uh probably like four days a week i know i do not look like it but but i go with them and have a good time so 

Recording: (6631/ 9621) 
yeah really that is awesome 

Recording: (6632/ 9621) 
do it the hard way to the easy way well i think everybody should have to do it the hard way i and frankly um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it 

Recording: (6633/ 9621) 
he is a picky eater which he is yeah he he does not like everything 

Recording: (6634/ 9621) 
computers that figure it out just to see if and uh oh and then they uh we had to locate our positions on a map 

Recording: (6635/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6636/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6637/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6638/ 9621) 
um well as far as my mom goes she is real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (6639/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6640/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6641/ 9621) 
you will 

Recording: (6642/ 9621) 
i would say we do at least an hour or more a day something like that 

Recording: (6643/ 9621) 
um-hum you know you have to you know you do not have a choice but at the same time you do not right you do not want to suffer but you want to keep them but it is whoops whoops i hope i did not move 

Recording: (6644/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6645/ 9621) 
or um like the art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival in doubling which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that um the concerts on the river on the worthington green really anything like that 

Recording: (6646/ 9621) 
if they hold you know enough of my views i am not going to vote for a woman just because they are a woman i am not going to vote for a democrat just because they are a democrat they better have you know at least and and i do not need a hundred percent uh agreement with my views but i would like to be it in the ninety to ninety five percent range um but yeah uh i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have i have moderated from when i was uh in college to today part of the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a center and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college um we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is a america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them you know have bad matters at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrong you know kids and you want them to behave well you know that is how i see america now and and america is become more centered uh and when it deviate from that either way that is when people become upset um so i just think it is important i i remember when um who was the other president that i voted for that one carter uh black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they would come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do that enough for blacks he did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say to to some of my black friends do not you see what you are doing do not you see the greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said you know that would be great in an ideal world this is not an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not i said what you are going to do is you are going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues you are going to give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that is just going to be added to everything else i know what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he is doing a good job and that we are moving along steadily uh and i you know i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means um i made that mistake when i was president of the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the leaking you know uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad chockboards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we are not going to support those and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said you know eighteen months later on the board put another um uh levy on the the ballot we said these are great school we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement in three months and all that kind of it it was image and we were saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better um we learn to say the negative in a positive way and that is important you know and you need to get that that you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservative you know that they want they want peace 

Recording: (6647/ 9621) 
oh gosh 

Recording: (6648/ 9621) 
and union is not gonna do that 

Recording: (6649/ 9621) 
it was on national news you see i am not that informed on that um 

Recording: (6650/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6651/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6652/ 9621) 
yeah like i said i have parts no different 

Recording: (6653/ 9621) 
uh trying to figure out what else to tell you i have worked here at the university uh twenty four years 

Recording: (6654/ 9621) 
it definitely did because i would sleep probably the eight hours right after practice until i woke up in the morning 

Recording: (6655/ 9621) 
and then there is right columbus 

Recording: (6656/ 9621) 
i have never i have never known of him 

Recording: (6657/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6658/ 9621) 
yeah well for so long i ate peanuts and i loved them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from it and um finally i did go to the doctor because i i i was so ill from it um and he said you are allergic um mainly it was the skins on like spanish peanuts and things and i never but my body must have build up this reaction to it because i i was always fine eating them and then they really turned on me so now i can not even eat any peanut products or the oil because everybody is like well you can eat natural peanut better i am like no it is the oil in there you know they grind up the peanut in it is the oil but um i probably had it for a long time and i was getting sick and thinking i had to flu or something and 

Recording: (6659/ 9621) 
well i think a little bit safer idea than uh eliminating guns because you know there is always going to be weapons out there instead of eliminating the problem you know more centralized it make it a national law that you have to be a certain age give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need make sure you are you know not going to just go out and blow somebody is head off for no reason you are keeping it for you know just either security reasons hunting reasons or practice you know but 

Recording: (6660/ 9621) 
oh okay 

Recording: (6661/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6662/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6663/ 9621) 
uh he had uh hip fusion is what it was called back then they had no artificial hips he had one leg this year or the other he had no hip joint whatsoever it was just 

Recording: (6664/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6665/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6666/ 9621) 
well right now um i work third third shift at a men is wear catalog 

Recording: (6667/ 9621) 
is there all your errors corrected even if you have to rewrite it six times i mean it just blows their mind when i say to them well the other day i wrote a letter to a senator and i had to write it six times i wrote the letter and rerode it until it was perfect and every time i reroted it got better and i wrote it six times and i am an english teacher 

Recording: (6668/ 9621) 
yeah the other way around is probably even harder 

Recording: (6669/ 9621) 
and i am gonna think the owners would be better just because the smaller class size i have like four hundred at my class right now 

Recording: (6670/ 9621) 
no you know i should i really should i do that with a dog without even realizing it but i have it just because i have ran for so many years or jog excuse me i do not run i am too slow get the truck terminology either yeah 

Recording: (6671/ 9621) 
i do not think it would hurt me not knowing it 

Recording: (6672/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6673/ 9621) 
she is four months almost five

um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6677/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (6678/ 9621) 
you know what i mean you can not do this you can not do that 

Recording: (6679/ 9621) 
do not pay 

Recording: (6680/ 9621) 
um beethoven i think it was beethoven that did not talk until he was like seven and they thought he was retarded but you see these people just their brains wire differently than ours is and you just you can not ever expect them to approach any problem like you would because they will not it just does not seem logical to them they are usually real good at puzzles they are usually real good at you know things that manipulative things that do not take words things that you just have to solve by just manipulating things around yeah 

Recording: (6681/ 9621) 
when i say i do not like the way it is heading their crime is so many houses and everything and apartments and stuff 

Recording: (6682/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6683/ 9621) 
afterwards too and that is one of the things they have asked for in the adoption agreement and the couple is willing to do that 

Recording: (6684/ 9621) 
and i like the area it is pretty flat down there and then plus these several houses got to do a lot of good places to fish 

Recording: (6685/ 9621) 
a little but not not near you know like she is no 

Recording: (6686/ 9621) 
oh i am not shocked to the bad behavior in i do not consider it is justice 

Recording: (6687/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6688/ 9621) 
the only time i ever did 

Recording: (6689/ 9621) 
these kids do not get well just because it is the holidays well you guys should stay here and work along with us yeah right we should also get a hundred and twenty five bucks an hour like you guys do too 

Recording: (6690/ 9621) 
every week i record them i yeah i like exlaws 

Recording: (6691/ 9621) 
give us a job sure 

Recording: (6692/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6693/ 9621) 
i i like to talk about columbus 

Recording: (6694/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (6695/ 9621) 
and dug out the door it under it 

Recording: (6696/ 9621) 
so he is not so crazy she was doing this thing where um if he did a good job on something she would give him like a fake coin they put it in a little bank and at the end of the week or something he could cash and then get a video or a video game or something you know that shows responsibility too but 

Recording: (6697/ 9621) 
and it is not fair to her or the other people 

Recording: (6698/ 9621) 
and then we we know where to shift from there to another target 

Recording: (6699/ 9621) 
oh yeah and i have not i have not heard the rest of the story but um what i have heard i mean in in court he would not have a chance that is no both chance 

Recording: (6700/ 9621) 
do they have like these big lecture halls over there too 

Recording: (6701/ 9621) 
and then i got here and i do not i do not care yeah 

Recording: (6702/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6703/ 9621) 
they are usually going to get a lot of date 

Recording: (6704/ 9621) 
and i was just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack okayans one the powder cocaine another you know and what they are saying it on that is uh that is a prejudice thing is what they are saying because they are saying more blacks do crack cocaine and power cocaine is the prison thing i am sure you read the paper the way i look at it uh i have had four heart attacks every time i have a heart attack they they swear up and down i do cocaine 

Recording: (6705/ 9621) 
that is why they had such little showclives i guess when they could lock in you mean when this you hit when this hit your head i would hurt come because of kill all those 

Recording: (6706/ 9621) 
oh they have religion they have a religion class they have a religion every day but some of it is just starting with prayer and bible stories and so it is more the values a lot of the teachers are not catholic which i i was surprised to hear that uh in fact the religion teacher my daughter had a nice grade she had religion class every day was not catholic 

Recording: (6707/ 9621) 
whereas i do not know lutheran is a little bit more open to 

Recording: (6708/ 9621) 
um honestly it would be i would probably based a decision basically political um i can not say i would really hold that against him or anything obviously it is not something i would say oh good what is so for him since he did that 

Recording: (6709/ 9621) 
you are you are you are intelligent you know 

Recording: (6710/ 9621) 
um-hum i think his mom was pretty you know does not really talk about it want to talk about it he happens from his his real biological family is very um i do not know if you would call it dysfunctional or there um he did not live with them after he was fourteen or so his it was just so bad that his his mom could not take care of him and his his siblings so he was pretty much on his own but he was taken in by a family that was members of the mormon church 

Recording: (6711/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6712/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6713/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6714/ 9621) 
yeah because uh they are more you always hear about my black ass my you know what i am saying stuff like is and i could give a shit 

Recording: (6715/ 9621) 
yeah i have met a lot of different people in there lot of interesting people 

Recording: (6716/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6717/ 9621) 
they they just set up a on a flat bed truck on wall street in new york and do a concert there 

Recording: (6718/ 9621) 
when they drove by i 

Recording: (6719/ 9621) 
compared to you you will have more loyalty i would think and at the same time those people will not be thinking about being hungry while they are on the line working for you 

Recording: (6720/ 9621) 
um-hum but you know when you first came here he said that you could not win here because you had too many slow white guys so 

Recording: (6721/ 9621) 
uh five years ago almost five years ago a couple months short of that oh yeah 

Recording: (6722/ 9621) 
so she did i do not know whether it was more than a year or not for i think it was forty dollars a month and uh of course that was forty dollars more than they had otherwise and uh then i think uh let us see she well she went out there when bernis was going to school because bern oldest one uh my oldest sister went to uh one of their first or maybe even second grade out there so she she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever had in grade school but uh then they hired a girl to come in there is a hair girl and uh about the second or third day she was there she was not was not feeling very good 

Recording: (6723/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6724/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (6725/ 9621) 
if i would grown up with the maybe they would have that thing going on my sister has which is a bunch of mexico share mexico experiences but i just i just wear 

Recording: (6726/ 9621) 
yeah make their job earlier and faster uh you know in library libraries like some of the other places especially universities are facing budget problems and as subscriptions for periodicals are just outrageous 

Recording: (6727/ 9621) 
and the administrators for telecommunications for state of ohio are working with us as observer because they do not have staff 

Recording: (6728/ 9621) 
i was born in brooklyn new york 

Recording: (6729/ 9621)

Recording: (6730/ 9621) 
and you uh it is just like the game battle ship pretty much you know a four a two eight seven and um well i will have a three dollar one i have won probably four out of five you know and that i have not bought that many of them but in that race right there four out of five is not too bad got my mom one on her birthday she got fifteen dollars and the other times i get them i either win my three dollars back or i win nine dollars 

Recording: (6731/ 9621) 
with people who want them 

Recording: (6732/ 9621) 
and it has not it has not gone far as long that i loaned sharking but you know the the thing of it is it is fun when you win and it is still fun when you lose i mean you know just 

Recording: (6733/ 9621) 
and just you know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there was always something different i guess to be outside and there is just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (6734/ 9621) 
it is more our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (6735/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6736/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6737/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6738/ 9621) 
um i i when i was growing up i had had a little clearer cats 

Recording: (6739/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6740/ 9621) 
if not you just get there the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and this and that but when you actually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (6741/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6742/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6743/ 9621) 
yeah and yeah and i would not do that i if i was you know had no children and 

Recording: (6744/ 9621) 
so you know uh it it is pretty pretty busy there but it it is spread out over the sixteen hours as where as poor columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes in an hour is time so 

Recording: (6745/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6746/ 9621) 
and they are like wow let us do this too we can make school you know let out for a little bit i they might not be doing it to um 

Recording: (6747/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6748/ 9621) 
i you know i i do not have him kid you know not being that close to it it is hard to know i mean i have always i have always thought that that uh what their friends did and what they what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as as anything that that the school could do but i know the school school is a very powerful force in the kids life you know i mean it is a kids life 

Recording: (6749/ 9621) 
well it is kind of hard you would see he is got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together he does not see at all 

Recording: (6750/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6751/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6752/ 9621) 
well how he felt and knowing that we were not neglecting him or two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing and dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (6753/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6755/ 9621) 
no not at all i would value a vote if from a kane over bush because bush he he comes from a political family which i am not saying he is wrong because the kennedys were a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like everything is been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if he did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to think and find that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (6756/ 9621) 
no actually i was uh going to get my ged after that 

Recording: (6757/ 9621) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and players um-hum um i do not know it is northland is such uh a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um a hurting or you know a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both and there is ladders everywhere there is sears everywhere or not why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to players if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah we will probably move within a year um-hum 

Recording: (6758/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6759/ 9621) 
uh-huh but you meant she would never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party 

Recording: (6760/ 9621) 
we are still working those problems out yeah 

Recording: (6761/ 9621) 
again it gets back to being in the home did your mother give you everything you wanted then she failed you did not she 

Recording: (6762/ 9621) 
and of course i think too as in america the uh the farm families you know they wanted that was more laborers for the then your so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it it uh it just made sense to me in fact it looks like in my family that they are going to the children are going to be mostly in twos you know not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are forty two and forty one soon to be forty one so uh i think that their child bearing years are over 

Recording: (6763/ 9621) 
i know i wish i knew how to sew i can do buttons that is about it um-hum 

Recording: (6764/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (6765/ 9621) 
right right he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and that would speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say please nancy i changed my name i went to college i just decided i am out of here i am everything is gone and so she would say uh nancy please just talk to your father just for just for my sake please and i would think i am a child here i should not have to be the one to make peace in this family if he does not want to talk to me i do not need him i do not have to talk to him 

Recording: (6766/ 9621) 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder 

Recording: (6767/ 9621) 
no there is a lot of people go to church that are not worth anything too you know so i do not really believe that going to church you know uh uh makes you a better human being than another human being i believe that the you know your i believe that the you know you are i believe that most people with basic uh structure in life if it is based similar to a bible or you could say bullism or whatever you know uh uh that you intend to have a better life than you will if you practice non quote unquote religious really just really just ways but i do not believe somebody going to church makes them a better you know being the next person uh because there is a lot of hypocrites that go to church uh these kids i i think more just more than anything else i mean one thing i i remember hearing in a lot about too was that what they would have picked on 

Recording: (6768/ 9621) 
and uh so it is why they lost my job after that and things got difficult more and more difficult um was unable to work full time i am doing some part time work right now working with people with mental illness um but it is you know the the thing i am running into out there is that uh nobody wants to pay you to do anything uh i do not understand that but uh and then the one they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you you know they give you a pay just so often they want to know where you are morning at night seven days a week and that is another business um so uh the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and and how i operate and will give me freedom to do what i can do i have a batch of other arts and communications but it is been more of a problem than it is been a asset um interviewing for jobs people that uh were doing the interviewing had just a high school education and uh they are not going to hire me when after a year i would be their boss um so a lot of that is out there uh regardless of what people say i am not trying to be pessimistic or negative it is just been my experience uh unfortunately um i hope it gets better but uh like i said i have not been ever uh told to my degree matters by any employer or compared to what the news tells you and what people will tell you oh go get that college degree uh you know people told me as soon as i got out of college then i needed a master is and then they said and after you had your master is you will definitely need your doctorate well you know the people saying this are college people they are colleges of business uh and it takes a while to realize that if you can get in and get that education on grant money in scholarships that is that is good but then even now being a person with uh some new disability from the brain injury uh i mean i do not even like to call it disability and i have uh different abilities now you know same abilities they used to do but i have to do them a different way um just because my brain function is on a different level and i can not explain that to anybody and i should not have to but i am always forced to um but uh trying to find a job you know uh resolving from this has been difficult and uh and and that is you know i am not giving up hope or nothing like that i am just trying to trying to cut through and see what i can do and uh you know there is just uh um it is very limited out there you know and and your education is is an asset but like i said even as a person now now going through bvr um i am discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelor is in other words uh bureaucational rehabilitation which is government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work and um because i already have a bachelor is they will not pay for school no if i was stupid you know if i just had a basic just got out of grade school and did not even have my ged boy they would pay for my high school my college and everything you know even living expenses you know but because i have a bachelor is nothing you know 

Recording: (6769/ 9621) 
um i liked it there is an episode i think it was in the third season where they were stuck on an island or island

Recording: (6787/ 9621) 
and he and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough to bring the start out because he was behind and 

Recording: (6788/ 9621) 
yeah i think every college does 

Recording: (6789/ 9621)

really 

Recording: (6794/ 9621) 
i went to brookhaven which is uh up on carl road near north and all 

Recording: (6795/ 9621) 
but that is you know that is a sign that that not only are we doing the dumbing down of jobs 

Recording: (6796/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (6797/ 9621) 
and we could not have class and in addition they were like trying to tip over bosses and throwing stones at them 

Recording: (6798/ 9621) 
and and that split second i was like okay he is gonna do this to me he is gonna do this to my kids 

Recording: (6799/ 9621) 
well i i work with around mostly black people and it is a weird situation uh there is more prejudice that i have noticed now than when i only worked around a couple of them 

Recording: (6800/ 9621) 
it is i just i can not believe there is that many people that need the service all the time 

Recording: (6801/ 9621) 
there is some um foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding classes 

Recording: (6802/ 9621) 
um-hum uh well my oldest one is it is really odd because uh the school she goes to it is sort of like uh thrift store sheek and a lot of kids there go to three stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said you know we are not in the poor house you are not buying clothes at the thrift store so she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it and i thought oh my gosh you know because she just looks like a bum i think and you know when it was time for like a uh a a dance or something she would go out and buy a dress you know at penney is or some place at them all you know and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress and the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home i would go what did they say you know about your dress and she goes julina is that you and i go see you clean up really nice i said you know you have the best shape you are ever going to have in your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these sackgy pants i said yeah when you get when you get your fifties and you have got a gut and a big ass you know you could do that 

Recording: (6803/ 9621) 
and uh so 

Recording: (6804/ 9621) 
and then um like people who work go back until they you know maybe two to six um the kids are down of school for the day at like twelve or one 

Recording: (6805/ 9621) 
in the elementary school library it is um we focus on sex so much in our society i think and and part of family so sex is such a small part of family life you know i mean it uh especially with the elementary school kids i mean it is just is is there working cookies after school 

Recording: (6806/ 9621) 
but we go out and look at we do do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the the uh second world yeah we are

Recording: (6808/ 9621) 
that is where my father is from 

Recording: (6809/ 9621) 
um at the same time at the same time um that my mother and my dad split up i was just about to start my second year at williams in high school so i am about to start my sophomore year and for the first time in something like three years i am at the school for two years in a row and so i was like no i i just finally made friends there is no way i made friends we just finally succeeded in making um my father and i always understood each other it was noise to stop by thing so my father and i are i am going to start getting phone calls here in a little bit i will just post upon so my father and i always for the third time understood each other much better than my mother and i did um we were in a community in uh very similar fashions we did not always agree and in fact i probably want to more vengeance opposed to him than anybody else i ever got to play with um but at least understood what was going on from one moment to the next and so it was kind of a no brainer it was like all my friends and so many who understand 

Recording: (6810/ 9621) 
i am working here uh but working uh work studying 

Recording: (6811/ 9621)

yeah i do not think that though you know women need to work and most families do need two incomes um and plus when kids go into high school you know you have pardon me you have to worry about them but you know you you have to let them experience some life on their own 

Recording: (6899/ 9621) 
i got one sister 

Recording: (6900/ 9621) 
well that basically is there you know those are influx of people move out or city limits and everything you know then uh you know you got to have places within the shop and everything and basically the north of mall has been there forever jacobs who owned indians owned it uh he never did anything to it you know so he got whatever he realized there is your pennies and uh mainstay places that generally move there because of the uh years ago because it was something well it was right there where there were a lot of people population and everything and then like i say if you you know you got basically the people moving out to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff you know not that you are moving away from it they are still getting into it but no but just your perspective on it uh then you have to if you build it they were kind of the same you know so um-hum um-hum and i guess you are still going to build it so 

Recording: (6901/ 9621) 
some of them are pretty good at that some of them are not too hm some of them like when you have them copy like from this box down to this box these little shades in a certain amount of time if their visual perception is messed up they screw that all up they you know the form goes this way they draw it this way their brain slips it around on them that is why they have trouble with ends and use and bees and bees and they are still reverseing you know normal kids that goes away about age eight and my kids are still doing it you know they are still or they might make an eight from the bottom up instead of from the top down or six from the bottom up i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up you could tell by watching them right that their brain did not work like yours did 

Recording: (6902/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6903/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6904/ 9621) 
yeah yeah people say things like oh anyways i have had a job where i got three months off every summer and i am just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game i was grading papers at the kitchen table you know and if i go out of town on the weekend i have to take my school bag and all my work with me it never ends you know i put in about seventy hours a week during the time of the year when i do teach and by the way it is not three months anymore you work for a week after the kids get out of school in june which usually puts you in about the twelfth of the fifteenth of june school starts back the twenty third of august at least in worthington it did and you have to be back a week before that so they have shaved both ends of that off till it is like ten days in june and maybe fifteen days in august and all of july so and then you spend some of that time going to seminars and upgraded your certificate 

Recording: (6905/ 9621) 
i mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tech border not a big real real thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh library of congress has it i will just try about to washington or have them send it here you know um that i think is a major contribution of the past generation uh 

Recording: (6906/ 9621) 
uh which is nice has got a a lot of support from everybody gets gets good kind of confusing on holidays 

Recording: (6907/ 9621) 
is not that unbelievable 

Recording: (6908/ 9621) 
yeah archie bunkerer meets fred flintstone area go i can not really put him in the category of forest gump because forest gump was a great guy 

Recording: (6909/ 9621) 
yep i graduated from burlington 

Recording: (6910/ 9621) 
well all you can you do is beat my rear end you know so 

Recording: (6911/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6912/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6913/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6914/ 9621) 
really close 

Recording: (6915/ 9621) 
yeah it lives in my house in san 

Recording: (6916/ 9621) 
i was 

Recording: (6917/ 9621) 
yeah like it will be under something real weird or like multimillion or something like that you know it is like i do not know who who how they designed it that way 

Recording: (6918/ 9621) 
makes it difficult it is an adjustment 

Recording: (6919/ 9621) 
yeah most of them do and then you know pretty much the rest of them just hang out go to school 

Recording: (6920/ 9621) 
see that is how my husband was thinking of a pet growing up 

Recording: (6921/ 9621) 
well i know with myself when we had pete always says that it was not for me he would have gotten just too amused in his job because he is really involved you know he likes what he is doing his tremendous responsibility and but he loves it but the thing is when the kids were little too you know i was always having to pull him back and say do not forget you know they are going to grow fast if you if you do not spend this time and now i mean like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he is been at this for all these years and i do not have to do that anymore i mean someplace along the way about ten years ago he got so involved in their lives but when they are little 

Recording: (6922/ 9621) 
let us see i usually go out to lunch at like some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner 

Recording: (6923/ 9621) 
so we are over the standards to meet that 

Recording: (6924/ 9621) 
a she pulled and they were not very desirable as such a month other than for easy hurting she and we come in dirty one 

Recording: (6925/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6926/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (6927/ 9621) 
you know you know do i feel safe as this is place i can go is there is somebody who always takes care of me and and i think left to their own devices 

Recording: (6928/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6929/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah because they think they are grown they think they are grown and they are like twelve and thirteen and they have been having sex since they were ten and it is just like and yeah and they are having babies earlier and earlier and it is just really scary 

Recording: (6930/ 9621) 
right i have a neighbor that is at 

Recording: (6931/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6932/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6933/ 9621) 
right well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three 

Recording: (6934/ 9621) 
yeah i think i i just think that typically you see a lot of lot of places that are that are under construction and not very many people work either 

Recording: (6935/ 9621) 
because i was going to be opening up on the sex um looking forward to doing that we had a um uh season is passed to uh in john lake spent a lot of time to the pools um different sunners hunter different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here to high state they have got the um um recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go um we go to the zoo a lot libraries have story times reading hours those type of things um all kinds of community things easter egg times at the rec centers 

Recording: (6936/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (6937/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6938/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6939/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (6940/ 9621) 
discipline i would be screamed at made get jumped on the floor to do push ups i mean it was it was 

Recording: (6941/ 9621) 
do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it is like six and seven hours a day at the computer and i just do not wanna do it 

Recording: (6942/ 9621) 
retire yeah 

Recording: (6943/ 9621) 
that was all i knew 

Recording: (6944/ 9621) 
that is exactly how i am when you say what would i do you know i might do a house i might just go to school some i used do not have a gallery i might do something like that again you know there is just like there is just billions of projects out there waiting to happen and so it is just 

Recording: (6945/ 9621) 
it is just the the spiritual aspect there is around even einstein the most brilliant man supposedly mathematical of our time uh even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yeah but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory 

Recording: (6946/ 9621) 
that would probably affect my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6947/ 9621) 
yeah they got it spring break a couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (6948/ 9621) 
uh goes on uh you you know nationally you know uh especially interested in this presidential election 

Recording: (6949/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6950/ 9621) 
do not you think 

Recording: (6951/ 9621) 
but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do and they got to think of that they have a free education and they just do not think of it that way you know they think they can make enough money but you know 

Recording: (6952/ 9621) 
and also at the show of hands calories and 

Recording: (6953/ 9621) 
do 

Recording: (6954/ 9621) 
i wish they would clean it up more often no it is not spring out from where i am i do not live in the suburbia area so i mean i live i live right in the middle of all the houses that have been there for sixty or seventy years and i am smack dab in the middle of all the frats and sororities so i am yeah it is fine it is fine spreads out fine i just think it is funny i i would love to get a good nice overhead view of columbus because you probably see the house after house after house and you know like they did right in the right in the um fifties uh i can not remember what it is called like where every single house is in mirror image of the one right beside it and you have got all these streets that are in the exact same pattern all you know like for like miles and miles and miles but um no i think it is cool that they are all spreading out oh yeah one thing they could really do with columbus that i have noticed or i would say lack of noticed in any other city in the united states why in the world do they have to work on all the roads all at the same time i do not understand they have to they are working on three fifteen two seventy seventy one six seventy all at the same time why uh why i do not understand it yeah apparently notyeah and no notnot really 

Recording: (6955/ 9621) 
uh-huh oh i stationed uh purdue station was in north carolina 

Recording: (6956/ 9621) 
yeah he did not can afford to go there so they did not 

Recording: (6957/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6958/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6959/ 9621) 
okay yeah sure that is okay 

Recording: (6960/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (6961/ 9621) 
i can fire them because they are gay i can care less 

Recording: (6962/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6963/ 9621) 
so however this works out you know i do not know i just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know 

Recording: (6964/ 9621) 
well her major is communications it did not start out that but my daughter wants to write books okay wow 

Recording: (6965/ 9621) 
no i am living yeah that is my dad by uh brooklyn 

Recording: (6966/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (6967/ 9621) 
her and a mother went to see it and everything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie 

Recording: (6968/ 9621) 
and then how so as far as that to them when you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningful interviews with these people so that we can learn from them i put them on spot light but we so now we just still want to uh i guess flood them up the we do not want to get the negative answer because oh my image of the university oh gee now who was it catson mower or something oh yeah well hey we realize that the university only wants players who draw gate money that is all they want to do they do not have academics they do not talk about activities when they come into the high state 

Recording: (6969/ 9621) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital um-hum those things happen 

Recording: (6970/ 9621) 
it was 

Recording: (6971/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6973/ 9621) 
a lot of people have switched from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (6974/ 9621) 
uh i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there is no more solicitor groups in the other that i know 

Recording: (6975/ 9621) 
eventually 

Recording: (6976/ 9621) 
he works he 

Recording: (6977/ 9621) 
um i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is it is like a it is a foot in the door if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and 

Recording: (6978/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (6979/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6980/ 9621) 
i have almost been hit i do not know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turn it in with their turnstitch 

Recording: (6981/ 9621) 
there there is a way back access to some of our system when that is all i am we are putting in more uniform wanted for everything and i do not it may be they oh it has its own system but they can also connect our system for things they do not have in their system and it is so i am not sure what system your talking about 

Recording: (6982/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6983/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6984/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (6985/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (6986/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah you can not ignore it i mean because you know because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word but um now everybody knows and um anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called a fabricate and and so it is better if you can refuse that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but ooh i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6987/ 9621) 
yeah like like five hundred people in a lecture hall yeah 

Recording: (6988/ 9621) 
um yeah i got uh two thirty five 

Recording: (6989/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (6990/ 9621) 
the united states knows about it they can not sit there and go pay the welfare they will not do nothing to him 

Recording: (6991/ 9621) 
right real war 

Recording: (6992/ 9621) 
right and it is all the bucks yeah because people i work with you know uh there there are some people i work with of house payments one guy he has the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a month and a lot of them have like fifty hundred and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago and it is like forty five and i would not dare tell them that but it is like you know because they are always uh you know there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they have got to have the best of everything the best of it is like you know you know you i to me you just have to kind of think about things a little bit it is like you know do i do i really need to go to uh what would i say um uh tia fridays for lunch and spend twelve dollars or kind of go to taco bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like uh a book for my kid or you know uh they have like my daughters in swimming i need the money for a swim suit well why do not i use it for that you know so it is 

Recording: (6993/ 9621) 
because it is more open um and you count it in terms of civil rights um my boyfriend thinks it is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against i he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent the way to do that is through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is as sin i think that um your sex quality is genetic based and that i you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a die on it you may put a different um whatever those eye pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that is just cosmetics and anyone who tries to change your sexual orientation that is cosmetics too uh and again uh i believe is whatever happens between consent adults is their business not mine um so i do not know that anyone could change it uh what was your question again 

Recording: (6994/ 9621) 
uh wander around to look at things 

Recording: (6995/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (6997/ 9621) 
well it is got to come from the top uhyou know i i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction so i was saying you know it is an organizational problem with no you know no motivation uh you know to do their job you know properly now i live down the street from what they call cause it is uh columbus uh alternative high school and uh you get there through a lottery system and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarships uh my son went there one year uh it was a disaster for him 

Recording: (6998/ 9621) 
yeah they are real strict with getting money and bach ideas but yeah 

Recording: (6999/ 9621) 
a bad one or a good one 

Recording: (7000/ 9621) 
so it is been a lot of pressure there 

Recording: (7001/ 9621) 
and uh a disease that affected her mind and of course you know back then i did not really know that but there was a lot of conflict 

Recording: (7002/ 9621) 
yeah but yeah it was interesting 

Recording: (7003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7004/ 9621) 
fliped me out 

Recording: (7005/ 9621) 
how can you do that 

Recording: (7006/ 9621) 
i mean i did not have the greatest chance to talk to my kid the way so these people talked uh about them one today you knowtalked to hereight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to sit here at mommy so she made her sit with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and little kid is trying to study her home or you know her uh well i do not know whether you up on night partying or was you up on night working you know or what the hell is your problem 

Recording: (7007/ 9621) 
i do not really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for louisville dole and then she opened her mouth and things came out and uh she had the best chance out of any uh any woman that is ever run for president and she was in a major party which has not happened before and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it is you know be the first man after having run for the office 

Recording: (7008/ 9621) 
but they but then in the very next breath they said well in two weeks we are going to california to visit paul now now and you know what i was telling you each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this and they are all going oh my you know my own girls are going you know and my my daughter who is thirteen is fabulous she is so blunt she is such she is just so out there and so different from so many other children um and she said well do you actually care if he comes here you do not care do you and i said well i do not care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings 

Recording: (7009/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7010/ 9621) 
my personally do not believe they should be allowed to because i believe they they should have the no wonder as well as the you know wonder for a proper premium 

Recording: (7011/ 9621) 
you know i think a lot of it depends on i do not know for each different parts of the country but the cultures and everything because you know it just seems in uh some parts of the midwest but maybe kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there and a lot of them get married so young they just that is just what they want to do you know they do not but they are not thinking of any future wanting to go to college or anything like that i am sorry i do not want them be like 

Recording: (7012/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7013/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7014/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (7015/ 9621) 
for something like that just for something to do 

Recording: (7016/ 9621) 
happened sometime uh probably when my my freshman year in high school uh we are just walking down the high street and i guess there wrong place at the wrong time and some people were like killing stuff and we could not make out what they were saying 

Recording: (7017/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7018/ 9621) 
first grade the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed but the principal would not let her give it to her to give him had to do what everything anybody else in the class was doing he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade and it the last grading period she would give them just everyday she would give them a math paper to work on he said i showed you i and i do not have to do this i am not doing it 

Recording: (7019/ 9621) 
just seems like a waste of legislation money 

Recording: (7020/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7021/ 9621) 
you want to know where i was born 

Recording: (7022/ 9621) 
yeah and she is just like yeah the minute we walk in the door it is like you guys clock out 

Recording: (7023/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7024/ 9621) 
as it was jacobs sold to the northland mall anyway so it is probably going to be like a strip mall more or less 

Recording: (7025/ 9621) 
yeah she lives there by her uh hospital 

Recording: (7026/ 9621) 
to marry them and she moved over and 

Recording: (7027/ 9621) 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against him and that is what i would i want my you know my son to keep i want him to know the father and be around him even though he is not the best best a person but you know 

Recording: (7028/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7029/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7030/ 9621) 
well see that is not proved out by the the uh frugal ratings he still has higher approval than reagan had in his last eighteen months so you know people still like what he what he is done i think that that um that you know people do not like all the crap that went with him is the bundance on tv you know they say that and they are they are still trying to get him i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to elizabeth dole they would not have been able to attack on the issue so they would find other things to get get iran so they started bringing out all these women and all that stuff on and most people did not care about it they did not care about it before the election they did not care about it during his campaign they did not care about it during his presidency it was some republican right wing i do not know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate you know you may have been a cat you know you may have but she was twenty one it is not like it was someone who could not make up her own mind what she wanted to do you know and he may have been stupid and a cat but i do not want to know about it on day one when it hit the the news i did not want to know about it and on the end when he was you know not impeached i did not want to know about it and in between i did not want to know about it and they just kept angering me because there are other things i wanted the government to do and this congress is the worst i have ever seen and not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the paws of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women is rights and and things that are important to people you know they they have tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they try to make a pseudo issue out of you know giving a tax cut people do not want a tax cut when it is going to affect their social security or affect you know uh the the the deficit 

Recording: (7031/ 9621) 
yeah but yeah umhumi think the mother has more of a instinct for that but as far as the studies go where the people roll over in their babies i do not see how you could roll over on anything that size and not know it unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever you know what i mean 

Recording: (7032/ 9621) 
um i would like to teach um the the field is particularly saturatedated right now so i am not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i could distinguished myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am approaching things like whatever happens happens i am going to pursue my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after i finish my schooling 

Recording: (7033/ 9621) 
that is awfully young but again he is got this baby yet they did not talk about how this baby how you make a baby or everything and i do not know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it is just like okay 

Recording: (7034/ 9621) 
they are dare 

Recording: (7035/ 9621) 
definitely i definitely the way i feel that death penalty is wrong but uh i do not know people are always like oh you know if your mother if your mother was killed god forbid but like you would want the death penalty but honestly i do not think i would i really like i would feel angry toward that person but killing them would does not help me with my maybe the families say it helps with the closure and everything but i i that to me is it is misplacing my anger in a way that actually i do not think that my victim that was so close to me would want me to do you know so 

Recording: (7036/ 9621) 
and uh then well she was out there she met a a cowboy who was from alzheimer from a while and uh they uh they were married they were out there i guess but uh she was says my son he says she is a piece of work she she had definite ideas about it important or everything 

Recording: (7037/ 9621) 
oh well i and this and here uh here i come from this is a gentleman that is uh dark skin i do not know if he is black or color and still produces to what different color is but uh he says you know my brothers probably came to these islands to to the continental they come down here and they are getting all the little they are swaying themselves they are i can cock you to me and so forth i say we do not do that here and i said but i noticed you know uh there is a lot of black population here or uh creo mix and that type of thing which i would consider colored not black uh to me black is black if you have anything mixed in your area is colored uh but he said uh we do not do that uh he said probably in the states god you guys kind of he wants a kid wants a car and gives me a car down here johnny comes from school i i gave him a dinner but i asked him to sleep off the porch now i will still give him this dinner but i asked him please did you do there sleep on the porch may not sound much but at least i am trying to teach him something and you you saw a lot of it down there in the in the people where we were down in the frederburg but uh it it is it is just those things you you learn and then there is other times i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw very improperty shot areas so 

Recording: (7038/ 9621) 
um secretarial um administrative assistant type work 

Recording: (7039/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (7040/ 9621) 
yeah you it then uh i you know i have just come to i always you know prefer for my children than myself i mean uh if there is anything disney i usually go and watch it you know at the movie theater and after a while it is like i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me it is like that is a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it 

Recording: (7041/ 9621) 
yeah that was it that is hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you just go wow what what were those people thinking um yeah 

Recording: (7042/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7043/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7044/ 9621) 
there has been some serious consideration but no there was some a lot someone took up a petition and was virginia to do it but he decided he did not want to devote that much time away from his uh his television program oh he is he is quite a smart fellow i reallyoh yeahjust like for you and that where they get into the slump and everything you know something like that they have done all that for that more are these and i think he is said yet to do anything on his room more and to keep his ready so i i think that is what you mean by getting into this person does over here that another thing you need to get because john dole jane does and i mean that is right she has a person be yourself and say nosome of this conversation we have had here uh has been influenced within our family uh we have minister is we have doctors we have lawyers we have uh farmers we have uh farmers we have uh politicians what else we got in there we have 

Recording: (7045/ 9621)

Recording: (7046/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7047/ 9621) 
as much fun as it was the first time uh i just not 

Recording: (7048/ 9621) 
it is crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything you know and i have got home my gas is anyway just give me a list and somebody is like i want to get this and i want to get that so it is just it is just been it is been something else which is which is good though because our families are pretty similar and they are all 

Recording: (7049/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7050/ 9621) 
uh civil rights uh only went so far they have not corrected the wrongs in the past they have not uh created a a a sense in our society that anyone can not you like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute why 

Recording: (7051/ 9621) 
and they were just wild you know i just ran every minute and i took it as a substitute and did not know from day to day you know whether it was going to keep it i finally had to say i can not do this twenty seven kidner cars i am sorry i can not do this by myself 

Recording: (7052/ 9621) 
really is so is it is that so like they have the the economy is pretty good right now well right now it it is shaky okay not too many doctor comes apparently over there 

Recording: (7053/ 9621) 
uh uh no i am i can not speak from my relationship no my dad was uh out of town quite a bit when we were growing up so uh from a maternal aspect you know mom was there all the time and uh and a lot of times she filled the both the male and the female the mother and the father role you know as far as punishment and everything like that but uh uh it just would depend i i know in my respect it would have been a lot better i think for myself or than everything you know i mean for you know we would have been able to had uh joint custody with her and everything you know when she was growing up because for well barbara being out there i mean you know you can just imagine she is you know been being a girl not saying girl any bad about girls it being my daughter you know worrying about things in school and weekends and stuff like that so where if i was closer to her i would not worry that much about uh 

Recording: (7054/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7055/ 9621) 
and he got broken into and uh you know he is paying around on this apartment and he is back home because the police said that this apartment has been hit many times so it is just a big mess right now you know he had uh uh nice uh you know is is better clothes stolen his you know jewelry um a few other minor things they did not want his tv and vcr and those kind of things to get stolen so they moved them back home and they started worrying about something else and that moved back they need to worried about his car because somebody down the street got their purse stolen so it is just a going to be a matter of rearranging he is um applying for another scholarship he gets um already so he would get this other scholarship i think it uh would help him uh be able to uh move into the i think you can get out of the apartment by sub sub leasing it you have to get the seventy five dollars to give to the land lord to they charge seventy five to do that to advertise and um screen 

Recording: (7056/ 9621) 
i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i said in in general people are pretty good people 

Recording: (7057/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7058/ 9621) 
yeah it is 

Recording: (7059/ 9621) 
i i moved into the dorms late september last fall 

Recording: (7060/ 9621) 
what 

Recording: (7061/ 9621) 
why i would not push it on them because that is almost made me be resentful towards being catholic just the fact that i had it forced on me 

Recording: (7062/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (7063/ 9621) 
well the uh worth family and uh the criminals have been around forever you know uh we are just in industries and and the worth family is clumbers to spatch uh uh then you got uh i think it is for suda uh who is like a what is a construction guy so uh uh they have been around forever and everything and uh they can get their ways through uh political arena and everything but i think most of the money was uh was private money but they were given like tax incentives and things and things of that nature 

Recording: (7064/ 9621) 
that is a pretty much a worthy place 

Recording: (7065/ 9621) 
and um yeah i uh uh i would never i would i would never want to go back to the old way never 

Recording: (7066/ 9621) 
and field or teller is really or i found it really interesting because there is uh when you get into figuring firing data 

Recording: (7067/ 9621) 
that 

Recording: (7068/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7069/ 9621) 
what it is is most people want do not want kids that live in reality 

Recording: (7070/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7071/ 9621) 
and and no legal sanctions are going to make any particular difference to the attitude you have going into it 

Recording: (7072/ 9621) 
that is not right right away i am getting there 

Recording: (7073/ 9621) 
i would not doubt it i hope they vote against it but i do not think they will 

Recording: (7074/ 9621) 
well it is kind of it is kind of hard when you have got your your limited choices here you know so but some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you are looking at the the oil candidates did you watch that debate 

Recording: (7075/ 9621) 
because it stops your heart right away 

Recording: (7076/ 9621) 
no i i do not think so 

Recording: (7077/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7078/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7079/ 9621) 
in 

Recording: (7080/ 9621) 
but there is things that are difficult like there uh just that where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to fit fit certain criteria they have to be baptized and not follow all these health codes and all the different codes and but that is not what they are interested in doing so and and that is hard i think and like going on emissions really they did not understand that they are my dad just like did they know how small you are they are sending you to siberia and so 

Recording: (7081/ 9621) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have the things to worry about that people do now i mean when i was in elementary and junior high i we would have never dreamed of anybody having a good gun or even let alone a knife i mean that and that is violence and that is that goes back to kids and how much time and and effort you put into them you know kids are ignored and pushed aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and you know and then they get into school and they get violent and they they take it out you know and everybody is surprised you know i am not because i know there is a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids and um and going to school it is going to be so dangerous i think because you have so many of them in one little room and they are coming from so many different backgrounds and if you take each one of their situations i can bet the statistics as time goes on that they are they are not going to have one caring parent you know maybe not even one of the parents you know they might have a foster family or you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there is a lot of the people that that are foster families that only want the money you know and and there is all that so it is it is really scary and i think i think that it something has to be done real fast i do not know what i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there the computers i mean oh my gosh i did not even get a computer because i was so afraid of what they could be able to access there was nothing you know there was nothing barred at all when they first came out yeah and you know where are all those software people they are not responsible for ymk they are not responsible for you know all this internet access to all this stuff so it is really hard 

Recording: (7082/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7083/ 9621) 
that is where it is possessed i i uh if i could figure out how to work f disk and format and dos i might be able to figure out what my problem is because i started running i started running when there was two thousand about three months ago that was a dumb mistake one of the guys in my house is software private and he got me a copy of two thousand he was like do your computer will run two thousand let us put it on your computer so i was 

Recording: (7084/ 9621) 
older kids you know 

Recording: (7085/ 9621) 
well you have to uh try some different things like put on head phones with music that does not have any words and try to read somewhere like 

Recording: (7086/ 9621) 
you know i have never i i used to uh have an office out there that i visited all the time but uh i have never been out there to she actually lives in kirkwood which is a suburb 

Recording: (7087/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7088/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7089/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (7090/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7091/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7092/ 9621) 
yeah that is mainly what happens is uh you get all the out of town bad stuff i mean just kind of absorbs like a sponge 

Recording: (7093/ 9621) 
well i believe it is quality not quality uh ideally you know uh one parent would be there be it male or female you know neither one male or whatever but uh but you know your quality time is more important you know and if you go come home and you you know you want to do a sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever you know not spend any time with your child it does not matter whether you are there all day or whether you are there for two hours 

Recording: (7094/ 9621) 
it is just been so 

Recording: (7095/ 9621) 
i have no idea it is kind of like picking the the least of evils 

Recording: (7096/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7097/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7098/ 9621) 
and my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like you know what can i do and she just like calm down rich will just calm down and 

Recording: (7099/ 9621) 
so it is tough 

Recording: (7100/ 9621) 
well it is not it is not how it is put into effect the law it is how it is enforced you know you do not just say well you know well johnny stuck is finger in the pie and you can not do that anymore and you know the more the more security you are going to have over that pie the more he is going to want it so and and going into the gun thing it is pretty much nobody is winning game i mean you make stricter laws you are going to get you know even more and more people you know struggling to get a gun and shoot somebody is head off so um oh the school thing pretty much says itself metal detectors and police that the schools you know it is come down to that nowadays and um and uh any gun you get from criminals you know should i mean they already killed them that buck i steal but there is a little bit more you can do with those than burn them you know you could set them up in uh some kind of top secret lab you know out in dc somewhere the penagon just have rooms and rooms stacked full of guns and i mean hell in case we have to do have to go to war you know just keep out a little reserve 

Recording: (7101/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7102/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7103/ 9621) 
yeah it it is it is difficult 

Recording: (7104/ 9621) 
and 

Recording: (7105/ 9621) 
not really i mean yeah there is some little flaws but 

Recording: (7106/ 9621) 
just like premarital sex i mean there was no way i would ever discuss anything like that ever with her i mean that was just something that you did not 

Recording: (7107/ 9621) 
we do not know who is in the airplane and there is there are c planes that do come in out of there 

Recording: (7108/ 9621) 
they probably would have been about seniors in high school or so 

Recording: (7109/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7110/ 9621) 
it is pretty much deliver papers go to class wrestling sleep 

Recording: (7111/ 9621) 
does not 

Recording: (7112/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7113/ 9621) 
and that they are not willing to do that for gifted students 

Recording: (7114/ 9621) 
absolutely 

Recording: (7115/ 9621) 
uh and i had been there three four days and finally at breakfast one morning henry said well you have not talked about clinton and the impeachment yet and i said henry because he is the republican i said i do not even want to go there i said i do not even think we we want to get involved in that conversation he says well at least they can understand you saying that but i thought you would you know i want to tell you where i am he said when this whole thing started i sat down and wrote every one of my um new jersey representatives all of my senators and all of the congress people in new jersey and told them that i will never ever in my life but republican again because of the way this has played out i mean this is a republican a lifelong republican he says i will always now vote democrat because this was just so stupid and such a waste of my my time the country is time the country is money uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you rather be really extreme right wing to feel other than that except here in central ohio 

Recording: (7116/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7117/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7118/ 9621) 
i think it would help i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people 

Recording: (7119/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7120/ 9621) 
people that just uh really want to teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people want to like even went into teaching at all you know but um i think that i would have just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do this to get this certain grade it is like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more compulsive education is weird like being forced to take this class like i think that if i i mean it is good to being forced to take up like a liberal arts thing because like you do not know what you want to do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it at all but then you decide you want to do something in math and you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (7121/ 9621) 
i do not know that much detail but most time it comes down to the lack of uh knowing your your children how they are going to react and certain things oh what it is uh i do not know details or a thing other than the fact that they are seem like the low endiness going on uh with them and uh and i think that is part of the problem we have in our in our life i have uh i it would be very difficult uh i think uh in our in traveling if you say okay i am going to give up this life here and go to the third world and live or let us let us let us reverse busting hey okay up arlington you live in the northwest side why do not you go down and live on the east side 

Recording: (7122/ 9621) 
seventy seven 

Recording: (7123/ 9621) 
so there was a couple people that went but probably two out of five hundred and nobody wanted to move so i stayed here 

Recording: (7124/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (7125/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7126/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7127/ 9621) 
you could argue both of those too but i uh i mean personally i would say that is just teaching them more than what they need to know i i i think that is a little bit too much 

Recording: (7128/ 9621) 
well it is not every sunday anymore but it was for a long time it was for a long time 

Recording: (7129/ 9621) 
i think he is in prison and um he has no driver is license privileges for life and you know it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff 

Recording: (7130/ 9621) 
you knowuhhuh uhhuhi do not whether i have ever pointed out this this out to you but he happened to be one of my uh fellow students out of ohio university now how he happened to learn all these things like he did i do not know i did not course he started out uh uh he boy he i think a very first thing he was a township trustee like paul was and then he ultimately became the mayor of cincinnati and he was a very effective oh yeah he was a very very effective he was well liked it 

Recording: (7131/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (7132/ 9621) 
she is been very mature about it uh and she has they are working out an arrangement with the 

Recording: (7133/ 9621) 
it is always been my feeling and and uh i try to be fair in the way i grade uh you know it is i try to be as objective as i can sometimes i i because i think it is important that people learn how to write i would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short 

Recording: (7134/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7135/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7136/ 9621) 
it was not at the time but you live in 

Recording: (7137/ 9621) 
columbus 

Recording: (7138/ 9621) 
go ahead if you 

Recording: (7139/ 9621) 
just pretty much that if you ask for unfor or goodness as granted whatever 

Recording: (7140/ 9621) 
um it would a little bit but at the same time i mean it was always a long time ago i mean i do not know how how far in the past you have to go for things to be considered a problem with something coming up again um i mean as long as he is not did not have any history of being like an addicted user or anything like that i mean i i can not say it really bothers me too much 

Recording: (7141/ 9621) 
my husband is black 

Recording: (7142/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7143/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (7144/ 9621) 
my husband stays going to kick my you know what and everything i said well i will be outside you know 

Recording: (7145/ 9621) 
you go to right right right well i started going to sunday school when i was five or six years old 

Recording: (7146/ 9621) 
that is what something like maybe you you need to the states 

Recording: (7147/ 9621) 
yeah he was up there too the old guy with a beard and a twed jacket and uh it was pretty cool and uh they said most you know most the students are not even from delaware 

Recording: (7148/ 9621) 
they had this thing about um the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been arrested have higher i accuse 

Recording: (7149/ 9621) 
just getting over there 

Recording: (7150/ 9621) 
uh my dad is remarried 

Recording: (7151/ 9621) 
we are finished 

Recording: (7152/ 9621) 
excuse me 

Recording: (7153/ 9621) 
or put you in peak or something you know if there is any problems between students i do not think they they they never would sit down with the students and have them talk it out you know they might send a peak or something 

Recording: (7154/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7155/ 9621) 
well you have to 

Recording: (7156/ 9621) 
so um there is from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it 

Recording: (7157/ 9621) 
oh they are they are very good they you call i usually just call and i walk down and by the time i get there the subs already 

Recording: (7158/ 9621) 
the problem is lack of commitment the lack of commitment and not saying hey there is a niche for you you can not be a male oh yeah you want to do the operation i can not be the you know yeah you want to do well why not be happy what you are god made you what you are why not make you the complete person you are and not strife for something you can not be 

Recording: (7159/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7160/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7161/ 9621) 
it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (7162/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7163/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7164/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (7165/ 9621) 
i would like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that would be a neat thing you know because like i know like iron boundaries and uh some like like the lower paying jobs like they have people that are illiterate and things like that and they can not like give paychecks out on thursdays because everyone will call off on fridays because they will go out and get drunk or i do not know what they do with their paychecks i know that is a big big problem 

Recording: (7166/ 9621) 
you know when i hear about kids twelve thirteen luckily i was about early but um i think once they start you know like sixth grade they really should relate to them 

Recording: (7167/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7168/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7169/ 9621) 
and it it is kind of weird because you when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period and i see them like what are you doing that for 

Recording: (7170/ 9621) 
right tuesday wednesday and thursday every night 

Recording: (7171/ 9621) 
now they are well that is i that is that is she plays the you know they are they are like her grandkids so that is 

Recording: (7172/ 9621) 
yeah that that is one of the drawbacks 

Recording: (7173/ 9621) 
no i knew i would not change my mind on that either i am pretty strong willed about that 

Recording: (7174/ 9621) 
but uh everybody in my family is mechanically inclined 

Recording: (7175/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7176/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7177/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7178/ 9621) 
i would get more people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i make in about ten or eleven bucks an hour 

Recording: (7179/ 9621) 
yeah i do not think i could vote for a violent president i could vote for a president they made some mistakes with their personal life 

Recording: (7180/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7182/ 9621) 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go 

Recording: (7183/ 9621) 
okay if all it is drink 

Recording: (7184/ 9621) 
and he could see uh assume he is educated and not stupid otherwise he would not be a magic rate could see that that person did that 

Recording: (7185/ 9621) 
um about yeah the we got her we have had her for two years yeah we did about six months we went to hawaii and got his brother married and then we came back we knew that would be the last long trip um and we were going to wait till this spring but we could not so we went to rescue service and got her yeah 

Recording: (7186/ 9621) 
i mean most men are dogs yeah 

Recording: (7187/ 9621) 
um-hum but that is kind of it it you know it kind of came through where they were like uh when i was growing up we had the uh uh you know you had your jobs and everything of course and you had your uh what we were called deads you know uh and i was kind of like in the middle you know i played a little bit of sport you know but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads you know and everything so uh so like i say i you know i was kind of associated with both of them but then the football players you know some of them were uh pretty uh pretty much asked us you know no other way to put it especially if they were got scholarships and stuff you know they were they could be real uh nasty but uh i just can not say i do not know i just think maybe i look looking at it back as like uh oh i have got into arguments with the few of them then see them later wrong you know and and it is like eight man you know that play a beer you know or whatever you know sorry about that we were uh she had five years ago you know and i do not i try to forget things that you know i mean my mind got enough to sort you know without worrying about uh which i do work quite a bit about things but uh about stupid stuff uh like that kind of you know somebody gets mad at you because you are uh you are uh not a jockey you know you are you are a you are a you are a disney or a that you know everybody trying to label people and stuff 

Recording: (7188/ 9621) 
i 

Recording: (7189/ 9621) 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transfitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not write and you can not spell then it is just even worse it is it is it is exasperated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (7190/ 9621) 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is but within the honors program i think there is some really really acceptable things going on 

Recording: (7191/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (7192/ 9621) 
and it is very hard my wife and i but we will get through it 

Recording: (7193/ 9621) 
yeah after you learn to know her 

Recording: (7194/ 9621) 
yeah and they are all so different but he is he deals real well with people so he is really and he is even thinking of going into uh business for himself yeah he almost did that this year and then he thought no i do not want all the headache so he is like the top guy of of the people that he works for so 

Recording: (7195/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7196/ 9621) 
i do hope that she does she is a good writer i do hope that you know someday she can be able to do that 

Recording: (7197/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7198/ 9621) 
yeah and people do not 

Recording: (7199/ 9621) 
yeah and i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen in high school so we kind of grew up together and i did not know anything else and um just two complete different people you know different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (7200/ 9621) 
are you did not 

Recording: (7201/ 9621) 
what 

Recording: (7202/ 9621) 
and he is very opinionated and it is interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing uh you can tell that he is thought thought about and has you know clearly formulated what his stance is on it and he is very article about it uh sometimes his response is very mature but he is nineteen 

Recording: (7203/ 9621) 
is the only time for money yes 

Recording: (7204/ 9621) 
well obviously i sort of surmounted that because i have been you know i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then you know after that you know you just sort of you know get to the point where you just kind of you know laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then 

Recording: (7205/ 9621) 
it is my deal idea is about it so i am i figured something i should know about so 

Recording: (7206/ 9621) 
abduction is differentno no the the law is the parents the parents and the whole parents uh being able to handle the children uh-huh so yes the whole thing is the movies and the whole can see with somebody else is firm or somebody else is whatever uh because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here is again you are reaching out to your friends your neighbor you are not just forgetting about taking care of him and let the welfare of him and let him go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is and and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is left and when you are trying and willing to have well some people will probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can you know have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what jeans they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not but later on you will find out but it is still you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are going to be able to trace these jeans back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherited over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find out how the child better 

Recording: (7207/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7208/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7209/ 9621)

Recording: (7210/ 9621) 
well we do not want to know she is the only one that wants to know her her uh boyfriend he does not want to know either so sierra decided that she could not go and find out the sex of it because she could not keep a secret yes so so anyhow we do not we just do not know 

Recording: (7211/ 9621) 
um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community based programs getting but again those are my values i does in say steering the kids into a church space program if they can not be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them giving them the guidance they need the ymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (7212/ 9621) 
german yeah 

Recording: (7213/ 9621) 
i do not think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it is just too long uh people start turning out and there is only so much you can say and it is like the candidates 

Recording: (7214/ 9621) 
and i do not agree with that either 

Recording: (7215/ 9621) 
i thought i would expect that from dogs i mean yeah a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff and probably they like 

Recording: (7216/ 9621) 
i know i uh i mean i started 

Recording: (7217/ 9621) 
um-hum well i had a driver down here last time so i had to come back i had to come with herwould you get something i dropped her off and she took the bus home so 

Recording: (7218/ 9621) 
right out like 

Recording: (7219/ 9621) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on tv and then you started seeing a couple of black people on tv and then there was the jefferson and although i found the jefferson offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of of of black people in many ways in retrospect it was trans setting and what it did and and even in putting blacks in um advertisements on tv young kids saw them uh and and saw those ads and saw those tv programs until it became uh a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of stereo typical um but i am sure it does have uh some influence because i think it did it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepperd helped also 

Recording: (7220/ 9621) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfiedian band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument i i do not think we ever got a is b is and c is yeah 

Recording: (7221/ 9621) 
i have not been anywhere except for canada and uh um now i grew falls i was about three years old now that is when my dad died while we was up or knew last so

Recording: (7224/ 9621)

Recording: (7228/ 9621) 
violentance 

Recording: (7229/ 9621) 
i i i do not think it is necessarily that i think it comes back to the lack of selfdiscipline 

Recording: (7230/ 9621) 
at coast side 

Recording: (7231/ 9621) 
um the reason that it was one of the best years of my life it is it is an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly of course young people but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers and uh i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions as a matter of fact that that is something i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes or something money like that it is like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the question 

Recording: (7232/ 9621) 
they are supposed to be not physically possible because against the first law of physics but i saw it happen

uh-huh 

Recording: (7235/ 9621) 
they will be getting a van yep um grew up in upper arlington not far yeah really those five miles makes such a difference though like because i yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (7236/ 9621) 
this things are hers 

Recording: (7237/ 9621) 
you know so unfortunately you know i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressures put on schools and education now 

Recording: (7238/ 9621) 
where they can go every day the way i look at it also too uh when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was fourteen you can not even find a job unless you are sixteen nowadays 

Recording: (7239/ 9621) 
um it is considered urban but because it is north of akron and we play like a lot of like the inner city like in akron schools but in my opinion it is the barbia like but we have the we have the big city problems like there is a lot of drugs and i think that is just because the building is old so no one really takes pride in it and then it is two thousand people 

Recording: (7240/ 9621) 
well when he first started out 

Recording: (7241/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (7242/ 9621) 
graph design in particular after i quit wrestling i got really into computers so i pretty much live on my computer now 

Recording: (7243/ 9621) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out just come came back a couple months ago um my grandfather just passed away but he was here and a nursing home for about a year 

Recording: (7244/ 9621) 
yeah i thought it was going to be like not so structured but it really is and like especially i mean i know it is like all first year classes are basically the same and it is just kind of like how i do not know i thought it would be different like more of uh like more of an adult type thing when really it and i really did not like that like it was like i do not know it was like living in a hotel or something it was really weird and like 

Recording: (7245/ 9621) 
i have sex um-hum 

Recording: (7246/ 9621) 
because there is some people that actually can not work 

Recording: (7247/ 9621)

um-hum 

Recording: (7249/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7250/ 9621) 
i do not know i had not thought about that uh uh no i do not i do not get the impression the values has anything to do with what they are doing in the school 

Recording: (7251/ 9621) 
but um 

Recording: (7252/ 9621) 
they will also give and let them work seventy five percent if they are sick i had a heart attack i had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave and like i said i have been here twenty five years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it was not a good enough reason 

Recording: (7253/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7254/ 9621) 
they always find some silly way to slant his words and make him look bad and it is really disgusting i mean 

Recording: (7255/ 9621) 
uh i know that is a lot easier said than done because you fall in love every other rigs sometimes when you are young um but i do not think it encourages it i just think and you know they show so much on tv it is all you know people are newed on at ten oclock at night on these shows and these girls are watching it i mean great and most of them are adults but on the soap operas and stuff it is a different story so there is seeing it anyways uh you just i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say you know we we want to give you this option we very prefer you do not do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 

Recording: (7256/ 9621)

Recording: (7268/ 9621) 
okay no i have not followed it really 

Recording: (7269/ 9621)

Recording: (7287/ 9621) 
bring what is in your heart out and sometimes you will say stuff that does not even make sense but you say it and it brings it out and that is what it is for so i mean it is uh it is a struggle understanding that and uh uh i made it through all four rounds this time and uh i even sat up which was the first time um it is a struggle but it is uh it is necessary for the way i follow if it is especially for men women have a purification every month 

Recording: (7288/ 9621) 
at this point i i am stopped for a moment and i am just like so nobody can think their divorce was so important that i need to sit down to deal with it because i i obviously i i i have a curiosity that something is black as a is a foot and so okay i sit down is that your your father killed himself this morning and uh and then there is like a sort of a white out period there so you know get like decent details on on what occurred i do not actually think anything exciting occurred i think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister is wet stinky hair because it is supposed to cigarette smoke for some reason so wet stinky hair wet because i was crying into it and um and then more time passes so some indeterate length of time later um i i look over at the police officer who is standing on one side the cops are there basically to make sure i do not freak out and that is finally skunk in i was like the cops are here so you do not freak i am like well i am not really in any danger of breaking out am i am you okay so i look like you would never know that is why the cops were here oh okay well that makes more sense i was like okay so i looked over there and i said i have a friend upstairs and i was not able to put on anything more than that and it did not come out anywhere near that well 

Recording: (7289/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7290/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (7291/ 9621) 
um to stay home with my parents for a while you know it it is kind of good for me just to be away it is part of the experience like learning to do my own laundry and stuff i used to be so bad about it and now all of a sudden i am do not care really 

Recording: (7292/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7293/ 9621) 
all this other stuff 

Recording: (7294/ 9621) 
i know well you get you get to take advantage of it for layoffs and stuff 

Recording: (7295/ 9621) 
they are day care oh i do not know it is tough i think really i believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of day care offer it is just there is not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you know but you know we would not live as nice as we do we would not have as nice a cars as we do you know we would struggle a little more so so it is a toss up it is a real 

Recording: (7296/ 9621) 
well he he yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum it was just like he taught seventh grade they gave him math science um supposedly social studies all stuff that i mean it was just it was very poorly run to begin with so we would go out and try and find books for the kids i do not know if you heard that they he had not bought them books and so we had to buy them and i mean they got reimbursed but it was just ridiculous so they were trying to do anything they could and just to keep their jobs and keep the school 

Recording: (7297/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7298/ 9621) 
herry and all like oh my god what did we do like my grandmother is name was olive when i was born and my dad said boy she looks just like your mother to my mom and i have turned out to do everything that she did i have turned out to teach she was a teacher i have turned out to be you know real good in the kitchen and baking and i do like crafts like she did knitting and crocheting and i do that but i am sure god did not name me all of

Recording: (7301/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7302/ 9621) 
yeah the one thing they have done is they have put on bigger airplanes because it used to be you know you like a uh say a seven thirty seven would go from here to new york city and now it is a seven fifty seven so that adds more seats so instead of because i when i first got there i could not understand at at o issue when it was like christmas time or something it would just you would drive up in the parking lot was just full of cars and you are like oh boy 

Recording: (7303/ 9621) 
nothing i mean his mom and his dad are cool and 

Recording: (7304/ 9621) 
uh poor people can not do that um so after all of a sudden on with her case she was left with about a million dollars and then out of that million the attorney in the firm got a third plus she had to pay off his expenses so really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars which if used wisely okay maybe she could have but it sounded to me like she did not have a money problem anyway she was a corporate person uh but a very stupid person um so i mean that is based on my my battle with the legal system i you know i have i have got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that are wanted to take the small claims court i even got the or uh a canceled check to prove it and everything but you know uh uh when i look at what the alternative is which is subject to myself to uh unfairness uh even though i feel like out of concrete no way you know uh those are the ones i mean i would have to pay an attorney and the cheapest buying in fine right now is a hundred and forty five dollars an hour 

Recording: (7305/ 9621) 
it is his dad his dad is dad and his dad

Recording: (7326/ 9621) 
they have not humum 

Recording: (7327/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7328/ 9621) 
i i do not know i do not remember 

Recording: (7329/ 9621) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things that whole thing about um as as far as like your student loans and being able to get into just help me you know and i think you know all this the as far as some of the issues go i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty recently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i i do not know if if it really if you really uh feel like is that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really you know and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they do not they do not ever really put anything into action and it is kind of skied along you know and i do not know if there is anything substantial i can say that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it um economy is fine i mean so it is not that he is not that he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much he is actually doing you know and i think that unfortunately it is spend a lot of your time trying to get out of out of personal issues that you have got yourself into and you can not really focus on anything that is that is positive that you want to do for for their country and i think i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was president you know i thought i would want to be president but you know you would have three or four things that you would think were very important you would you would hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that you feel like they would actually be able to accomplish some things and you really work to get some stuff done you know and i do not know if it is if it is just because you know you have to get agreement from all the other all the everybody else in government before you can pass anything or why you know why do not think things get taken care of i mean there is so many different issues that people want to look at and you just end up focusing on things like phillip morrison you know just like that i guess thing in the whole world you know and and there is so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are that are important i just i do not know maybe i mean i do not i do not i am not real up on everything that is been done but i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and and you would be able to say you know this is there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of and and i do not i just think people kind of lotted on it and say well this is it is like this you know we will see what we can kind of do about it and i am uh you know 

Recording: (7330/ 9621) 
well see my my husband would do that the it is not the same because it is i do not know what i i absolutely do not i think that is where his brain is completely lacking i make i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he said not a good judge of that you will have to check but because my well my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his ski boarding friends i said where are they oh they said they were going down on i said on campus how are my dead body you know he is not allowed down there 

Recording: (7331/ 9621) 
i listen to someone i just touch someone we will be successful you will be successful individual and that is what is most critical you yourself has to do it not the business because from you businesses observe 

Recording: (7332/ 9621) 
and we know that the result could be death then like and it and it is in the grass and the grass and thing one side will be the aggressive one would obviously because you can not have two uh too aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in its response you can not you know what i mean so in like a state of war it was like that so in that contact i think but like in the same contact i feel that it would be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because they did not um they did not decide to become a combatant so if you are if you are combatant and you make that decision or you are drafted which that that is kind of like making a decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose to be part of that society that i mean that is a little shadeier but still if you are if you both make the the desire to do it then so like if i were drafted i think i would find i am sure i would fight for the country you know but i do not think i would go think you know i just do not feel the need to go on a rampant or anything 

Recording: (7333/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7334/ 9621) 
yeah

i always wish somebody would redo a survey on that and say you know back in sixty five or whatever what is the difference between what they are teaching them then and what they teach them now is it really that or is it just our imagination just do not remember enough yeah but it seems more to me and computers really have helped it 

Recording: (7344/ 9621) 
yeah blue that that is right frank sinatra is the one who is saying no i will do it i did it my way and that is really i think the biggest problem in the world today i want to do it my way and you can not oh you have got to cooperate with the other person 

Recording: (7345/ 9621) 
you lose sight of that i think you know what i mean and a lot of those guys become real egotistical i mean i like my uncle and everything but 

Recording: (7346/ 9621) 
uh-huh uh-huh well and you know that song by itself probably if i just heard it once or twice that is okay yeah and she is an interesting character i guess i mean i do not know everything about her but i i remember that she insulted the pop

Recording: (7352/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7353/ 9621)

Recording: (7354/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7355/ 9621) 
and i had a few serious relationships but i just i never felt they were the right ones

in general i guess in the summer time uh that is the way it was when she was going to school uh now you know with her going to school like like at uh saint louis uh i guess it would be that way 

Recording: (7357/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7358/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7359/ 9621)

oh sure 

Recording: (7361/ 9621) 
on that 

Recording: (7362/ 9621) 
so the money is just kind of wasted 

Recording: (7363/ 9621) 
it seems like it just about everywhere on that street is uh one way or another criminal 

Recording: (7364/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7365/ 9621) 
well like um i knew uh one of my friends from somewhere was uh because kyle does a lot of acting and stuff and like um i one friend uh knew knew her like they did plays together like down at like columbus junior theater or something and like that is so like um that is how we got introduced to whatever and spent friends for a while couple couple years and 

Recording: (7366/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i think so yeah 

Recording: (7367/ 9621)

Recording: (7371/ 9621) 
yeah to happen you know it up your hand 

Recording: (7372/ 9621) 
normally i would say no but yeah i do just because let us face it i probably cant do it anyhow and i would feel better for them and if if they used it because uh you know it is not good for the children that are born it is not good for them um i would prefer abstinist but let us be realistic you know i think we are past that point now um i know a lot of christians argue oh but you are wrong well yeah i might be wrong but you know we we can not go backwards on that i do not think you can only work on your own 

Recording: (7373/ 9621) 
so it is still just sitting down on my computer so it is next to it um the only thing it is take it down you can only have half a dozen 

Recording: (7374/ 9621)

uh-huh yeah plus you have that uh which they have had for like twenty some years of compost or something uh which is a big thing down there you know uh local musicians and 

Recording: (7376/ 9621) 
yeah i can not 

Recording: (7377/ 9621) 
and there is all kinds of things going on i mean you if you had the money you could do something every night it is 

Recording: (7378/ 9621) 
maybe because she says uh less americans are different 

Recording: (7379/ 9621) 
and they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it and pretty much all the other problems well there were not really too many other problems i mean the economy is doing really well and foreign relations are always shaky but they are getting a little bit better 

Recording: (7380/ 9621) 
bruce in belgium so i have a game going on with a good friend of mine named michelle i have a stupid ring here you see the ring so um i have lost something like two incernations of the spring just flat out lost them because well i am an irresponsible cost and um one of them a third if you will i give to her 

Recording: (7381/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7382/ 9621) 
i like him personally and when he was running for a mayor i would have voted for him i met him and everything but i guess he just as plays the devil is advocate all the time at the uh at uh the uh school board meetings i heard this is just a room you want not gossip in here 

Recording: (7383/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7384/ 9621) 
that is like twenty five or thirty an hour 

Recording: (7385/ 9621) 
is there the resentment to things like mcdonald is there too or if it 

Recording: (7386/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7387/ 9621) 
um finish in high school um actually heard about a program where you can finish college on the internet 

Recording: (7388/ 9621) 
and they have excellent 

Recording: (7389/ 9621) 
well it is like that i 

Recording: (7390/ 9621) 
kind of 

Recording: (7391/ 9621) 
you know it was in the butt do not get me wrong he told me he was going to have me uh locked up for child abuse so i do his house in the car and took them downtown and took them inside and told him to tell them people because they are going to lock him up 

Recording: (7392/ 9621) 
you know but you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he is twenty two i still consider him a kid but they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to look for a program or what you need to look for or you need to check out you know are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work study job you know 

Recording: (7393/ 9621) 
i do not think so i do not think they did um but there was this other guy my mom was talking about the other day i do not know what she seen it on i guess he had did something like that and you know he was just listing he did like an interview with him and uh told them how much you know things he did like he did this and that and i guess he broke into bank once or something like that and got some accounts or something like that it is like whoa yeah that is 

Recording: (7394/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (7395/ 9621) 
media hype 

Recording: (7396/ 9621) 
i are not really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i would like to see them see the time reduced the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and that is all settled now and it is just sort of a you know the celebration type stuff well that is not interesting oh it could change them with the primaries like to me 

Recording: (7397/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7398/ 9621) 
yes um well i was raised most of my life in ashland it is about ten minutes north of manfield ohio and um i uh we moved there we moved there from mansfield so i have been living in the mansard ashland area for 

Recording: (7399/ 9621) 
i think she yeah she will 

Recording: (7400/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7401/ 9621) 
there was an indepth story about that i think it was i do not know if it was harper is magazine or what it was any uh a significant magazine where they had uh made a study on the new york situation now i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh as a matter of fact whatever it was i remember sending it into the uh city council uh of of dayton i just addressed it 

Recording: (7402/ 9621) 
they she is you know half naked and she is she would be a center full somewhere you know and those are little yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it is really scary um but nobody is doing anything about it that i can see and they do not really see a concern but like i said wait till the generations start growing up wait till those little kids that we put all those things in their head grows up then they will think wow we should have done something and well i am i am scared i hope i do not live real long it is it is scary well and then the guy that um i do not even remember what his name was he got a drunk driving charge a judge he was a judge now he is out he went back to work on monday 

Recording: (7403/ 9621) 
highly skilled or trained in the area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different looks but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know had to have been more than just you know sort of normal jobs versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private catholic high schools but even there you know there was you know a a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not i have been going on and that was only on a very small group there were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students that this happened out so 

Recording: (7404/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7405/ 9621) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post part of depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good are my going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice birth control so uh and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (7406/ 9621) 
not quite there not really 

Recording: (7407/ 9621) 
no sunlight you know and they do not give him they keep it warm and he is not allowed sheets or raises or you know other than an electric raiser so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me would be like that to me is actually like that has to be worse like just the agony in the and i think you would have to go and say and like there is really so much you i know it is for board games or something but like you can not does not even hear a human voice because i think it is something like that was reading in the scriptures like you are dead to the world for is the worst that you can do and so the world sees him you know what i mean so that would be rough that would be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i would like they say like now like people that observe him he is like saying to himself and he reads the bible like every day and but like i do not know that would be strange if he is such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being locking a room for like a few days 

Recording: (7408/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7409/ 9621) 
sixteen 

Recording: (7410/ 9621) 
a couple or three times to but on the phone and everything and then that sit there and say well you know you can call me every name in a book to whatever heck you want to but i am still your father so 

Recording: (7411/ 9621) 
just one school so that is how many there is there so 

Recording: (7412/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7414/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7415/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is very true 

Recording: (7416/ 9621) 
let us watch seven and nine 

Recording: (7417/ 9621) 
we well sort of and kind of yes we i mean we dated in high school but he ended up going to problem with somebody else and we i mean we we went to we went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom and his mom are camp fire leaders together in the whole bit and now we did not really date in um college kind of really did not get together at all freshman year he did go to school here and then um as i said i spent for ohio state and then i went into akla davidson is sporting good store to um buy his home suit my sophomore year and he was a cash year there 

Recording: (7418/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7419/ 9621) 
no i i i would not i am not saying i am to account at the public school but uh an alternative school i will send them to um private school i do not i would if i had the money to use it sure as i would that is definitely but i know i could not afford it that is why i have never thought about it really 

Recording: (7420/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7421/ 9621) 
yeah i stay away from salt uh soda and stuff like that pop uh coffee i do not have any problem there i do not drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though uh like pork products 

Recording: (7422/ 9621) 
wow that is great 

Recording: (7423/ 9621) 
and a lot of times unions uh they actually actually seem detriment like to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because the if the union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy uh lazy union as a representative of of these workers so they are more apt to go outside 

Recording: (7424/ 9621) 
yeah that would not work 

Recording: (7425/ 9621) 
um-hum right 

Recording: (7426/ 9621) 
i know that 

Recording: (7427/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7428/ 9621) 
but i do not think it is bad 

Recording: (7429/ 9621) 
so you know one day um it was a really bad day i would gone like tole soaklahoma with somebody and came back and you know i like i said i had not had anything to eat the entire day and i it was like it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i am too hungry you know to i am too tired and hungry and i just thought i am not making anything so i just went to bed and uh a guy knocked on my door which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he told me well you are only and i would not answer well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punched the uh the door knob and 

Recording: (7430/ 9621) 
actually i wore out 

Recording: (7431/ 9621) 
is that right but a lot of all the things like little well known high even spots you know like you know just try and keep them like a like a a secret away from the tourists 

Recording: (7432/ 9621) 
gays gays homosexual and all those 

Recording: (7433/ 9621) 
a few times that they did specifically say um homosexuality but i mean there were other things that they would cover i mean it is not like it is just uh a lot of salt on being gated or anything like that 

Recording: (7434/ 9621) 
within her her life they she she does more with the children because most of them live here you know our children are all away so 

Recording: (7435/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7436/ 9621) 
i do not know i mean i think it is kind of ridiculous for kids to pay to chew them you know or if they get caught chewing it like dsats my all my cousins went to the resale and if they got caught you income they had the pay 

Recording: (7437/ 9621) 
yeah well like i mean high school has always been really easy and like and like high school is really easy like i never really felt like challenged even remotely by anything like i mean it is it is so like high school is kind of like a joke and it was real fun and everything you know just to like not really have to do pretty much of anything you know and like um and like so college is a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i mean it is basically the same thing in high school you just have less time to do the material you know so it is just like as opposed to having three weeks to doing the paper and doing it the night before you have three days to do it and you still do it the night before it is just like i do not know i thought i just kind of like found out like that i really do not like school and like ever want to go back and like having to take having to take math classes again like i just like is not really my thing like when too like i always knew that this it would be like this you always have to take basic classes but like i was a history major and so it is like i do not care about math at all and like anything that i would do would be humanities or like so it is like 

Recording: (7438/ 9621) 
uh-huh an all white jury 

Recording: (7439/ 9621) 
well i 

Recording: (7440/ 9621) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i mean the i doubt if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizenship and the and the english and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know add some track one 

Recording: (7441/ 9621) 
uh i think they lost i think ohio state lost because they is just out there raining and reeling and after a while got out of hand not 

Recording: (7442/ 9621) 
bad acoustics really 

Recording: (7443/ 9621) 
it is different 

Recording: (7444/ 9621) 
i do not think we take up a huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through ornett as well which is i think it is just up in plano and they give us a do not mean name and all that 

Recording: (7445/ 9621) 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe no i think it is a high school in marion we have built on um an old weapons depot and so like leukemia is reason and so like that is their main campaign now is to informed the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things uh other uh they do anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so 

Recording: (7446/ 9621) 
over on and adjoining him oh about half a mile away i guess and he was getting even for the day before 

Recording: (7447/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7448/ 9621) 
and if it is not a necessity i will have to forward it right now well a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras and in order to do that both have to work with concerted i mean who is raising the kids if they are lucky they have got a loving grandparents ninety nine times out of a hundred i do not know that is a good statistic it is the babysitters or you know these places it is not a babysitter it is a babysitter school or something like that and that is not the same loving coddling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids and i think that that is one of the things that can change plus the fact that they change these stupid tv programs because that is a terrible influence a lot of kids is taking over their lives and it is not that now it is worse yet it is the kids are on the internet now that is even worse because then you can not even hear what they are getting into at least on tv you can walk in and sit and turn it off and you can go in i guess and see what they are on the internet and i am saying no sorry you can not end the internet anymore but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they have got the right program and the right person are talking to but too many times it is the other way around 

Recording: (7449/ 9621) 
yes exactly 

Recording: (7450/ 9621) 
i hate my my last name was terrible i hate my last name 

Recording: (7451/ 9621) 
well muggings on the subway or stuff you know just in general 

Recording: (7452/ 9621) 
just do not talk when other people are talking just general things that i think you should take for granted 

Recording: (7453/ 9621) 
uh relax uh get a a debt in job that does not come home with me uh try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so uh i i i am glad school yeah but also enjoy all the things i did not get to do 

Recording: (7454/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7455/ 9621) 
well and they had to cover their i know all of that but i do not think that is really been 

Recording: (7456/ 9621) 
or or somebody or or live they will claim the i was forced to say that as i walked out the door you know and it is a big lie 

Recording: (7457/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (7458/ 9621) 
well i know people that sleep outside and uh but not all of them are veterans and everything but they they are again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh staying in an open shelter or their way or something like that 

Recording: (7459/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7460/ 9621) 
and there is lighting effects like stroke blades disco balls 

Recording: (7461/ 9621) 
yeah just in march 

Recording: (7462/ 9621) 
i went to for grade school and for high school 

Recording: (7463/ 9621) 
or does this say this you know this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their whether they travel in groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habitat with the eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how to spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestsed the buils 

Recording: (7464/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7465/ 9621) 
oh man 

Recording: (7466/ 9621) 
so um 

Recording: (7467/ 9621) 
than i 

Recording: (7468/ 9621) 
exist area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7469/ 9621) 
light news uh that is why i read tend to read the alternative newspapers and stuff because you do get a different perspective it is it is probably just slanted but it is different they are right 

Recording: (7470/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7471/ 9621) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (7472/ 9621) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park are roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need that need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (7473/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7474/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7475/ 9621) 
okay that is what they did a lot of lot like biological studies is up there we have okay i have heard of it 

Recording: (7476/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7477/ 9621) 
uh i you had women are working before you had women working before but selfdiscipline is a big thing on family that is part of it selfdiscipline make it things too easy for us oh we can not do without it you ever you ever try to work for i mean you really struggle to achieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7478/ 9621) 
well i will have a maybe when i will i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7479/ 9621) 
then my sister lives in the middle of nebraska nobody gives it nobody wants to yeah what is out there i mean come watch a corn grow 

Recording: (7480/ 9621) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of drives about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple english friends and to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and it we would got lost and all these things it took us way long ago and it should have been a friend of the person we were visiting said like oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonald is long my way and i was like i i am a vegetarian i do not even eat at mcdonald is you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it is like that is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said mcdonald is would not survive here if no one ai not there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7481/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7482/ 9621) 
there well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about um about the loss the federal law suit against columbus 

Recording: (7483/ 9621) 
and that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more with people every day of our life that is where we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are a uh a parent getting giving allowance you do not give them the your kids uh money to do chores they normally expect them to do but you get them something in addition to develop more responsibility well we do not talk about responsibility i i i dare you say we are in the heck they say publicly this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do we talk about responsibility now 

Recording: (7484/ 9621) 
yeah and it is uh it is not too bad because i had to scratch off your ticket you gave 

Recording: (7485/ 9621) 
i just well but i did not understand as much as you probably i just like cld to what i needed to do to become an art major and i go to my advisors and they tell me what to take and it was the art advisors but i did not really think i had to do anything special like i do not know about the portfolio review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and then i just kind of went to cuomo state and went on vacation and came back and so i just got accepted into that college but yeah 

Recording: (7486/ 9621) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two guns so and that is me was but my high school is is two thousand people so i guess by ear numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (7487/ 9621) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (7488/ 9621) 
i am on the computer at least six hours a day 

Recording: (7489/ 9621) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (7490/ 9621) 
does that make sense 

Recording: (7491/ 9621) 
it is like just like like community showers and stuff and like um just how it is like one room that you like kind of live in or whatever you know it is more like like the army or something you know like real simple and everything is uniform and like uh 

Recording: (7492/ 9621) 
and she just came here and believe me a year ago said she could have her baby here 

Recording: (7493/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7494/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7495/ 9621) 
yeah i think that is probably you know i am i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that that people fall through 

Recording: (7496/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7497/ 9621) 
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun and ways around the school you know that is the big thing now but just that you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support crop through the administration if they do have a they have to wait until something is pretty pretty regious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (7498/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7499/ 9621) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (7500/ 9621) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at usu and they were um just asking people if they thought that christ had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i just like boy i think so yeah and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while that i read the book and i really prayed about it and took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really liked it and that was what i had been wanting so that is how i decided 

Recording: (7501/ 9621) 
right because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat tons of sugar and is overpriced 

Recording: (7502/ 9621)

Recording: (7513/ 9621) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (7514/ 9621) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yeah the special kid who has no area that he does not excel in like once i had a sixth grade girl who stole the nore time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of metals and gymnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gets something back i have had kids who got every bad you can get in boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that they are really it might not be related to school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in some other area like they are swimming or or scouting or whatever so they you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than the normal person with a hundred or ninety five iq yeah i have seen them long enough to know that and worked with them long enough to know that well like i have one boy who can not spell them he still spells it t h i m and he took my computer apart the other day and adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works 

Recording: (7515/ 9621) 
he um traced right whatever that means 

Recording: (7516/ 9621) 
and feed her and i go do not bother me i have had a bad day and i am tired you go watch tv and how are we raising children doing that you know you know and people say uh you have to have both those incomes because we have to do this and go why do you have to have a house that is three hundred thousand dollars why do you have to have a brand new car you know is not life sacrifices are not are not you supposed to like do best for your children you know i mean i my children do not have everything they do not have a saga you know my daughter has a car that goes to you know and it is twelve years old you know and i made her buy it i told her i says i will not buy you a car i said if you want a car you have to buy it and i said when it is time for maintenance you have to pay for it because she has to be responsible for things and she appreciates that you know and you know i admire her i mean she is the person i never was that age you know but you know i i do not take full responsibility for that but 

Recording: (7517/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7518/ 9621) 
no thanks 

Recording: (7519/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7520/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7521/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7522/ 9621) 
but 

Recording: (7523/ 9621) 
i am going to get done with this i swear 

Recording: (7524/ 9621) 
with their cycle and that is the way the indian people and many of the women refer to it is they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can not do that um there is just a lot there that uh you know women go through that purification every month so women really do not need to so long but it is there for them and they do participate um 

Recording: (7525/ 9621) 
but it just depends on still goes back to who you are now 

Recording: (7526/ 9621) 
and we were staying at his grandpa and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and see all kinds of racial slars towards black people 

Recording: (7527/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7528/ 9621) 
oh yeah yes and no they are kind of weird like that um what i have said a grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything there is a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racist um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people they are black people that they really like and i mean they are actually friends with some black people and they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racist towards i mean it is the same thing that goes with white people obviously there are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not want to deal with um i mean it is basically the same thingno yeahyeah yeah yeahyeah exactly nonoum i really do not think we do for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occur just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president um honestly um although i do not really see too many sexist problems i definitely do see guys still being more like the decision making type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and i would see them having an authority figure that is being a woman is causing problems to them 

Recording: (7529/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7530/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7531/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7532/ 9621) 
no the only thing that was really down there before i moved out was the lincoln lebeck tower the shorter one but but of course the university is just about the same in some ways the stadium and all that 

Recording: (7533/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because the nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (7534/ 9621) 
oh my 

Recording: (7535/ 9621) 
right no 

Recording: (7536/ 9621) 
oh yeah yeah what religion are you all that one it has all those the going rules that work out in real life christianity 

Recording: (7537/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7538/ 9621) 
oh what are you doing that for oh 

Recording: (7539/ 9621) 
um not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage are going to go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually this is a very hot topic in england right now because they are they have got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world and i mean there are stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurse office is one thing they are there you know they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just you know because of the simple fact of the statistics but they are they are doing it so at least at the very least they might as well be you know safe about it 

Recording: (7540/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7541/ 9621) 
yeah she still has the family 

Recording: (7542/ 9621) 
because then you know what if something major happens then fourth time then what but i think at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children because how many accidents happen to children like they are always breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7543/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7544/ 9621) 
i do not know anything about the stock market oh man do not let the shirt fool you 

Recording: (7545/ 9621) 
uh i think they are retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or i do not know well 

Recording: (7546/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (7547/ 9621) 
yeah the only thing i am going to do is maybe two weeks before i might get a hundred dollars from the bank machine and uh i have three cars so i probably have one of them full of gas and other than that it is like you know to me if you are a bank one and i am honeyton and january the second people have all kinds of problems you and i are going to be the laughing stock of the corporate america and you really think you and i want to do that so to me nobody is going to have a problem because here is they are going to go remember bank one you know you go get ten bucks and you get five hundred out of the machine and you know it is like who wants to do business with nobody is going to do that you know maybe some little company um that really does not you know have a big impact but i do not see where anything is going to happen at all you know 

Recording: (7548/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7549/ 9621) 
but uh she likes the spiritual of the community over there and 

Recording: (7550/ 9621) 
you know if if it does not effect them it is not there and if they do not have to 

Recording: (7551/ 9621) 
they do not get i do not think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they they raise money from the businesses in the community plus we charge for tickets for people to come and see us and sometimes it is sometimes we get a lot sometimes we do not get so many turns out the concerts we get the most the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we have children is choir because 

Recording: (7552/ 9621) 
no i am i am not really up on the coaching thing i mean any biking coach a game that takes players to play the game 

Recording: (7553/ 9621) 
he wants to yeah 

Recording: (7554/ 9621) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them about our school um i think a lot of it is is is really what you what as far as as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced ap classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think that they have options 

Recording: (7555/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7556/ 9621) 
okay well a few years ago there was this big fuss that you know we have got to close some schools we you know in roman is dropping it is you know just the way the population goes in roman is dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so it is close and it is just big studying they target it something to close well there is a big effort for the people this kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close the school so the board back down and changed its money the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but there was not some money for it so there was a big fuss about that and two years later they came out with another study they says well they need to refurbish or not some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuild them and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a stand that somebody is not going to like well if you are gonna shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (7557/ 9621) 
yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was the high school i went to i mean i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7558/ 9621) 
it is like like sometimes do i think about people you know they call and and especially when i talk to sometimes people call in and i i talk you know i get the same people or whatever you know it is well especially if like there is people have this real specific weird name or something that i can remember oh they will call back and i think about them as like how i have this you know like we have this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it is like to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like and the you know it is like it is real weird it is like uh yeah i get everybody 

Recording: (7559/ 9621) 
at the beginning he did perfectly but now he is doing this i went up at four oclock kind of thing and he gave him a bottle and he goes back to sleep but you know i do not want to walk all the way down through the morning worth it for a clock i can not see you fill in my way through the hallways and stuff 

Recording: (7560/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7561/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (7562/ 9621) 
right and and it sometimes that opens um the person uh because a child they are so innocent and you can help but love them and i know my mom had a big problem with the whole interrational 

Recording: (7563/ 9621)

actually um i went back i came back to ohio state um in let us see ninety three through ninety five and got a teaching certificate in science for secondary science and i taught for a year uh at a small school in lanc uh catholic high school down there and um left their uh part of it was my fault i was not very good at discipline in the classroom so that was probably one of the biggest problems i had but uh 

Recording: (7567/ 9621) 
yeah just had to leave me here we have been best friends for so many years 

Recording: (7568/ 9621) 
yeah that is interesting though because i think i think that that my whole i i mean i always still i still feel like i am just 

Recording: (7569/ 9621) 
well it was not i was in management for about thirteen fourteen years and it was not bad where i was before uh this management was it was the whole department it was uh i do not know what it was the people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole atmosphere like of that place and it was just people that i would known for years and gotten along well with were just they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just it was just not a good place to work 

Recording: (7570/ 9621) 
now that does not make any extra work for the teacher but it gives him a shot he usually will answer the concept he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows and if you only grade him on that he might have a shot at a sierra be i mean there is all kind of ways to modify uh give a reduced work amount uh give a kid a copy of another student is notes if his are crummy and he can not study from them we even have a thing in our school that it is it looks just like notebook paper and it is got the three holes in the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk but it is ncr you know the two copies 

Recording: (7571/ 9621) 
i mean we throw the book away on some of these other guys i mean they throw the key away on some of these guys and you know we want to set them in an an example and you know this one guy had one byuai two years ago so we really have he is got to be in jail for five years you know then this judge i mean he is got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he is still and he is still a judge and it monday morning he goes to work

Recording: (7591/ 9621) 
and not that that changed my opinion of her um but back then and nobody would talk about it and you know i just think in today is world we need to bring the subjects like that out no one because there is so many people who are a shame about things and they should not be a shame because it is a lifestyle anymore you know i just it needs to be brought up more 

Recording: (7592/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7593/ 9621) 
did she 

Recording: (7594/ 9621)

yeah my uh my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control uh the whole family was hunters hunters and things like that and my fatherinlaw was a hunter but he was not opposed to gun control either uh as long as he could hunt 

Recording: (7597/ 9621) 
it was that type it was real tight job market for librarians and yeah 

Recording: (7598/ 9621) 
i do not know i think it is kind of deal with it when it gets here though 

Recording: (7599/ 9621)

Recording: (7600/ 9621) 
yes i do i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (7601/ 9621) 
yeah my favorite character on that show had always been chicole and i do not like how i do not like how his character has been portrayed in in the recent couple of seasons um i like the fact that he was someone who had been a star fleet officer but because of a matter of principle uh left star fleet join the maverick but was still uh fundamentally an uh onerable person um and had to deal with being welcome back into the fold of star fleet by being uh first officer on the ship but still had to balance his his new life uh i saw so much potential for uh interesting stuff with that but i feel that he is become just a just another character to deliver lines for most of the episodes i have seen from this this past season i stopped 

Recording: (7602/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (7603/ 9621) 
um it was just yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem they just take over everything and they they do not pay their workers and most people are not mafia i do not get paid 

Recording: (7604/ 9621)

Recording: (7607/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7608/ 9621) 
they are identical in the black woman she gets the job but there is no to me the most qualified person she gets the job end of the story that is it you know it is it is best for society in general 

Recording: (7609/ 9621) 
an urban area 

Recording: (7610/ 9621) 
most of the trouble i have uh i got one neighbor that hates me and he is a share 

Recording: (7611/ 9621) 
i had not heard that one well i did see on tv late news after you would gone to bed last night i saw where there is another airplane went down as it took off from kennedy airport it was a in egyptian airline one and it had come to new york kennedy airport and he had flew all the way across the united states to california for some reason and i went back all the way over here and then they had just taken off on the whole where they not even a half an hour or whatever out in the ocean we are out all over the ocean all once the payment warm in thirty seconds or something i mean and it was down in what what thirty thousand feet or something well they must have they had to have been dead before they reached a water because of that sudden decline boy that would make you pass out of nothing else would and they are now they are trying to decide was it salvador was there something wrong with the plane was it palestine and so i do not know if if there is going to be more salvador stuff going on the way some of these countries fight over there in the other countries and try to get us involved i do not know i hope not i pray to god to something then all the good people are trying to say no god is going to come back and salvage the world you know all the good people will be here and probably the bad people maybe he will take the good people and make it a better world for us and the rest of them will suddenly die i dont know 

Recording: (7612/ 9621) 
uh-huh uh-huh what instrument do you play 

Recording: (7613/ 9621) 
which consists of art one sixty two through art two sixty 

Recording: (7614/ 9621) 
maybe i am with australia 

Recording: (7615/ 9621) 
they got all that white sand and uh you know that that water you can see down on some miles and uh 

Recording: (7616/ 9621) 
and uh we met i was working at a restaurant in short north and they were having a christmas party and his brother worked there and he brought my husband and i went there and that is how we met 

Recording: (7617/ 9621) 
but yet they will not lay off people that actually need the jobs 

Recording: (7618/ 9621) 
he ended up dying he ended up dying from um what the to the aids thank you from the aids fire situation going around when he was near dying what did he tell his mother and i will not use exactly words because it was professional and he said i really my life did not my mom and he is got three kids three growing kids right now so you see what made him change what influence in society to do that i do not know how we find it but i think if more people i do not think it was ever taught in the bible to do that was it i i really do not think so and i do not ever you know here at mary i am not that well a person comes to the bible but uh i do believe there is a god and i do believe in prayer and i do believe in gardening angels watching over you and i do not think you have to go to church to really believe all this because it is how you treat the other person that really counts and if i treat that person basically it boils down to treat the other person the way you would like to be treated 

Recording: (7619/ 9621) 
yeah i remember political correctness 

Recording: (7620/ 9621) 
it is uh 

Recording: (7621/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7622/ 9621) 
um i used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor and i used to go to work at like eight oclock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson and i did this six days a week and to get my my one day off i would get up at like at seven oclock and get my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car 

Recording: (7623/ 9621) 
there was one where they were going along and there is a little uh scramb your looking dog about so long and about that high kind of fall on long after joe i am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for it is worth all it works off than i am 

Recording: (7624/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (7625/ 9621) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over says that that is okay is the person does it to you i mean there my mother used to say for every law that was written there is another law written over here that will actually knob that one and i and actually as i have a growing older i have found that it is it is worse than today is world as i said as the silver rights move it and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any plea bargains and then the well but there are people who would get murdered instead of electric chair electric chair i still believe in it because if someone is and i do not believe that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that legal process where they can putting appeals thank you that is it i do not think that you should have that either one appeal or two should be the limit if they are still found guilty sorry and if an innocent person has not been able to prove he is innocent that is just one of those freaky things that happens because sometimes innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that is guilty that is corrupt enough in his mind and he knows how to get away with it and get somebody else take his brain but i do not think there is that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have nautilified that because what right does that person have to live tv just about two or three days ago and here is this guy down the south end and as he is walked out handgun behind him and they are putting him to cruiser well i did to her exactly what i said as you go to do is just says is your drawer the last breath he killed her now he is got to go and probably maybe a plea bargain and he will get off with it because maybe he was abused with the child and they had to learn just the way i was thinking what happened to this woman because of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three or four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (7626/ 9621) 
that is exactly what it is 

Recording: (7627/ 9621) 
well i do not know that that is a cause uh it they they as a group uh uh this was kind of a happenstance that it this occurred as a result of a very major world war uh so in in terms of them causing it it was it was a is sense and and part of this mass communication we are talking about uh began with them and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you were talking about uh uh uh greater uh greater intercommunication i would like to go back one step where we are talking about when i made mentioned the three doors down you do not even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we are nearing zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody with interpersonal communications that is the key my opinion personal versus interpersonal communications and and it is zero over here we are almost a hundred percent over here but when we are in this international or global or massive whatever term is the most appropriate um john doe who speaks here he has the faintest idea who jane dole is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah you knew who this person rise over here that is jane dole that lives in that third house and she married henry jackson do not you remember old henry well henry was a guy i lived way over there and the other side of town mass communications as it is today it happened a fiend idea where jane came from or where henrej where old is whoever it was lived over there i said so i think uh i think you need to distinction between the personal and the personal relationship so maybe i die grass too far thereor who the next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7628/ 9621) 
well i see i am going to have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say uh i i would really like to see this to happen but i also know that it it will never happen within the next three or four generations but i i am of a guy who still believe that the lady has a place in her home and i do not believe that we need uh man and wife out working and making incomes as everyone in the united states that they feels they must uh haze or hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and it was talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i my judgment is that we are spending today probably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they want and only twenty percent on what they need and that is all they need to spend on that need so therefore theness pardon 

Recording: (7629/ 9621) 
yeah i am i am opposed to parental consent um but i do not have kids so that that opinion does not mean as much as to write from someone who did 

Recording: (7630/ 9621) 
i had not heard thatyeah it it um some of it was not clinton is back down i think i sort of summaries what i just said is you know for the health insurance and reform the all that health insurance area um you know he backed down but it was not going to happen so he could keep you know the fear going for months and months or years and still nothing was going to happen it was the wrong time or we tried to move on to something else uh and it is regretable it has not come back like you said it is like well i made the one attempt and did not know anywhere else so let it drop and it is kind of for somebody else to pick it up well clinton is in lame duck it is why can not you bring it back 

Recording: (7631/ 9621) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (7632/ 9621) 
yeah just having fun 

Recording: (7633/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7634/ 9621) 
i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (7635/ 9621) 
in uh first grade his teacher knew that he needed that but the principal would not allow her to do it uh and that is one reason we put him in different school for second grade uh 

Recording: (7636/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7637/ 9621) 
and then on a little bit there is another one other side of us 

Recording: (7638/ 9621) 
um we have not was we know it is one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here 

Recording: (7639/ 9621) 
you know when she is in her middle years and camera when she is you know but you know i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing is the one thing in life we get to do where there is no restrictions no laws nobody gives you any limitations or parameters they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 

Recording: (7640/ 9621) 
i do not have nothing like that nowadays somebody fall through the ice and they sue them 

Recording: (7641/ 9621) 
yeah she does she comes back a lot 

Recording: (7642/ 9621) 
yeah in fact he uh let us see i i i do not remember i suppose that they had a draft when he was about twenty one 

Recording: (7643/ 9621) 
i like looking at the stories from a different perspective as a kid as a kid as i was always like 

Recording: (7644/ 9621) 
that is because their parents are rich 

Recording: (7645/ 9621) 
little less romantic 

Recording: (7646/ 9621) 
and the thing that was high school about my mom is that i it was somebody that was not real nice to me or that i did not really like she would not have anything to do with them i mean the whole thing was you know if i approved this person 

Recording: (7647/ 9621)

Recording: (7652/ 9621) 
um not so much um uh for for fifteen years i lived uh down on which is more um i have a lot of artists lived there but i am amazed that my new street is full of artists too 

Recording: (7653/ 9621) 
if you just said take or get i just i say well i am just going to because when you get none work out in the work world there is going to be two things they care about about your writing is it usable and is it persuaded because usually when you are writing something in the work place it is either to explain something or it is to persuade somebody to do something so if it is not those two things it is not it is not writing that is going to make it in the world it is i mean 

Recording: (7654/ 9621) 
you know society against taking away everything from you 

Recording: (7655/ 9621) 
i did 

Recording: (7656/ 9621) 
that is where you need to start you can not just say hey we got a snuck out of here we can screw him that is the problem and you are saying does it does it does it take home does it take church it takes morals and that is why it is telling me for before we got away from morals in our society we could care less about you i always said a a good successful salesman would be able to sell his own mother i mean sell his own mother on a on the market

Recording: (7661/ 9621) 
maybe at the under lying base

Recording: (7674/ 9621) 
um-hum

yeah yeah i applied for it and went after it aggressively 

Recording: (7678/ 9621) 
it is very hard i mean i missed a lot of school i mean most people would think that i have a lot of help but i really do not i mean i live with my parents and everything and i mean they have jobs too it is not like

child care and 

Recording: (7683/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7684/ 9621) 
what we should buy yeah the retail what we should buy and that is the problem we listen to business too much if business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves 

Recording: (7685/ 9621) 
anything probably in snow you know 

Recording: (7686/ 9621) 
it will be a long campaign i know it is interesting that that gore suggested that reagan suggested two two debates a week and i just can not imagine watching two debates a week for a month it is like well at least they could get things out into the open but uh they have the chance but who wants to watch that much has the time to watch that much 

Recording: (7687/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7688/ 9621) 
well yeah in a case like that the parents should know i mean because there is something going on 

Recording: (7689/ 9621) 
and they collect the cards 

Recording: (7690/ 9621) 
people would knock on the door and they would yell yeah that they were not home or something and 

Recording: (7691/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7692/ 9621) 
it is sort of a timely name in that it is it is you know been around for a long time yet people do not associate it with old women because there are still emmas today 

Recording: (7693/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7694/ 9621) 
so we focus on computers but we do camping and you know he teaches us a lot of uh business uh business ethic and 

Recording: (7695/ 9621) 
both um today i was farmed out to bank one uh yesterday it was monday i was farmed out to bank one friday farmed out to bank one but now i have resolved all those three issues and do not have anything else to throw out in the interesting so i am later tomorrow i will be back at the home office working on some other stuff that will benefit us in advertising because advertising is a much better way to make money than selling time for out for money selling time for money for money is tax 

Recording: (7696/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7697/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7698/ 9621) 
so i used to work at baker believe me on that 

Recording: (7699/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7700/ 9621) 
until see what else happens i mean from what i know the story was kind of happy and many ways a children story but what has to happen within the larger story between now and and you know the end of episode three is like the republic falls and the empire takes over and all the july are killed by this cute little eight year old kid 

Recording: (7701/ 9621) 
my oldest son was in vietnam 

Recording: (7702/ 9621) 
uh i am originally from indiana but i lived up in uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleveland center which is an air route traffic control center and i moved from there to ohio state airport and i worked there for nineteen years and uh then i transferred to port columbus 

Recording: (7703/ 9621) 
yeah we as going up there to i can not really remember you know it is been twenty years ago and i just you know i do not have any real recollection 

Recording: (7704/ 9621) 
i love it when people come from out of town because then i get to try new places and i am way behind i need more company 

Recording: (7705/ 9621) 
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice but but then here comes the uh cooper is wife and his daughter and like his son and i am thinking they are putting uh all these his family up in the hotel the night before game i mean i do not know i just thought it was very strange that he would have this whole family staying there with him when all none of those boys get to bring anybody you know i mean 

Recording: (7706/ 9621) 
you know before they tell you this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach they are telling you about the surf board that they got and how great they served when that really should come down in the body of the paper you know most people just they assume the reader knows i always say to my kids pretend like you are writing for an alien 

Recording: (7707/ 9621) 
uh well my son he worked on the coleman campaign so course uh you know i had to get out and you know help him put the signs out and all that kind of stuff and i got the bumper sticker got some people in my family some bumper sticker some neighbors 

Recording: (7708/ 9621) 
and you know i would show up at their house if i thought something was going on you know it do not matter me i am just i said i was grew up here in columbia and oh just dumb hill belly you know like uh i if they were having a party at somebody is house and their parents they know i would show up there to ask them what the hell was going on 

Recording: (7709/ 9621) 
yeah i mean a lot of people really that i knew anyway did not know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and then it was the whole talk of high school whatever 

Recording: (7710/ 9621) 
i am not agreeing with my grandma seems she seems to think okay maybe but if you put a discount for in there i would love it that is what she said all i was like okay 

Recording: (7711/ 9621) 
oh yeah i would 

Recording: (7712/ 9621) 
yeah there is a lot of positive things uh from as far as discipline as far as uh uh growing up faster and everything you know sometimes when i see more like my daughter or like other other people that age you know and everything are not you know they tend to act grown up you know where i felt like i was forced to grow up you know 

Recording: (7713/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7714/ 9621) 
keptor morning and then all of a sudden about the nineties they came around and said hey you know what our our deficit is going another way we are we are going away i will watch on this thing as because we have been spending more consumers doing the same thing they have not learned that mom and dad remember they have not learned that mom and dad remember mom and i only got a little piece of time to get things no i am at the whole house completely for any show with cars we do not talk about buying cars nowadays we talk about leasing cars and pretty soon we are not going to be buying a houses we are leasing houses from the finance companies we will not be owning a land the finance company owns you do not own it you lease in it and that is our quality of life and when we go to third world countries we say i do not know how they can stand living here and yet you know what they probably have better quality of understanding one than than we do because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further they have really become apart 

Recording: (7715/ 9621) 
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in restin virginia so they did they are all married well three are married yeah 

Recording: (7716/ 9621) 
and um it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job anyhow just kind of one of those okay let us do it 

Recording: (7717/ 9621) 
she is got like a third grade education she is like a kid herself 

Recording: (7718/ 9621) 
yeah i have not i i really have not even i have not even given it that much thought yet 

Recording: (7719/ 9621) 
well they did not say loud enough that you have the right to why we have never told thehuh the right you know i never was told like i make the telephone call and if they can convince them and the poor policeman can i think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything that is said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and then yet they have got that thing a lot it is illegal civil rights can not tape what i am saying it is like if we signed a paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are going to do and if boy if they say that and they really make it so and asked them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well then how could they say that they they they have got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalty stick 

Recording: (7720/ 9621) 
uh which we we encouraged that 

Recording: (7721/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7722/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7723/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7724/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7725/ 9621) 
hecleans the toilet too because he is a boy and boys even some men do not quite 

Recording: (7726/ 9621) 
starting over means putting a new operating system on it 

Recording: (7727/ 9621) 
you are really smart no you are not dumb but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things and that they can not do and so then they say well my parents are just saying that because they love me i am really stupid you know and you have to actually show them when they get to be this age that look you have a hundred and seventeen iq 

Recording: (7728/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (7729/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7730/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (7731/ 9621) 
prices so high 

Recording: (7732/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7733/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7734/ 9621) 
so they they could not go in that direction they would have to just bring in new people which uh i think it probably would not be a good idea 

Recording: (7735/ 9621) 
correct 

Recording: (7736/ 9621) 
i think it is true you you do not vote because you think i do not want either one of these people what is it matter 

Recording: (7737/ 9621) 
right i do not know where he lives now but yeah uh-huh i have i have seen him live before 

Recording: (7738/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7739/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7740/ 9621) 
i do not allow no hitting no you know and she kind of lets it get away that she lets them be a little rough because he is a boy but i do not 

Recording: (7741/ 9621) 
that is bad on the other hand it is not good to let your mind wander off somewhere i i find myself having to focus sometimes i am having to really um-hum 

Recording: (7742/ 9621) 
uh-huh uh-huh 

Recording: (7743/ 9621) 
no ignore them will not they because they are in their good sunday clothes 

Recording: (7744/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7745/ 9621) 
and how how many dollars does a consumer put into research i suppose the business that is the inequality in our life and you are you are basically putting the shop to the consumer 

Recording: (7746/ 9621) 
they say oh no we do not want all right say let us get a foreign exchange student this would be fun 

Recording: (7747/ 9621) 
yeah we have that many animals you know people 

Recording: (7748/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (7749/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7750/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7751/ 9621) 
yeah you are not allowed 

Recording: (7752/ 9621) 
it is over off of uh thirty three two seventy and thirty three 

Recording: (7753/ 9621) 
i am i have always lived in ohio so i am a native ohio and southern ohio um-hum right now i am staying at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five year old and uh my profession is a nurse i am a yeah but i have been taking a little while off since i have had the baby um-hum and um i i pretty much have picked up the belief in attachment parenting since i have had my second child and i it is where you believe in breast feeding from birth to whenever and holding you know like carrying the baby in the slaying with you and just being available for the baby is needs and just no not really oh i i feel a huge different for me personally um just in the um closeness and being able to pick up on his shoes a lot better and just knowing his needs 

Recording: (7754/ 9621) 
i believe them i do i it is i mean it is a very personal thing and that is what they saw most of my patients are head traum so they can not come up with some pretty wild stories but those versions are usually pretty clear and 

Recording: (7755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7756/ 9621) 
no it would probably be something with this foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 

Recording: (7757/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7758/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7759/ 9621) 
they are still on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our first kids and they called well are you still want to be on the list yeah we do not have any children but keep us on the list you know and it is like you say and there is three or four hundred kids in that day care it is a large day care but there is not a lot out there that is good quality you know i mean you it is scary and then you see it in the news uh and they were abusing the kids you know and you do not want to go to work feeling that you are worrying about your kids and we have never really felt like that and we kind of work a little different shifts my wife and i so our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she does not start till nine thirty and i pick them up at four so 

Recording: (7760/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7761/ 9621) 
that was real negative she is real negative about things and and tries to put me down for being positive or you know i always see a way out of something and she does not and she i think she gets kind of mad and plus she feels like she is old at fifty and i said oh my gosh you do not even have any bad habits i said you know you could live to be a hundred that is fifty more years you know i mean if you look at it that way she is really you know fifty is not old at all to me i mean that is just you as much as you learn you know you can not trade that but yeah my my one sister that is uh exactly seven years older than me we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know they will do that so it she is she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but 

Recording: (7762/ 9621) 
yeah she she had to talk and my sister and i attended it and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little of scratch would go in you know as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance it i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you do not want to put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7763/ 9621) 
free the paper and have the tv off there is something i think i might want to i might be interested in so i just do all those things and do my machine 

Recording: (7764/ 9621) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think in today is world what they call the nineties that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and when there was certain things we did or did not do and then it came along that when our kids grew up then there were so many things had changed and some of the one thing i can stand around this has not only do with politics but it is an example and in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took jump between algebra you would think you know i used to be straight a is in algebra when i got to jump i thought why am i taking this so that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they are teaching it entirely different now and i think linda explained to how they were doing it with matthews that she could not even help him on see you know it is in the same way of politics it is people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or they are whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but in my mother is say thing about our generation so i think it is just a sign of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (7765/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7766/ 9621) 
all the way over to eleven seventy you know the to 

Recording: (7767/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7768/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (7769/ 9621) 
and the cops were going to be near the christ and and now christ is just near me trying to be near me no idea what the hell is going on and i i this this things end too and uh it was like you you do not you do they tell you any do you do you i have no idea what is going on uh and i could not do anything about i could not tell him i could not communicate i was totally incapable yeah it 

Recording: (7770/ 9621) 
stay on 

Recording: (7771/ 9621) 
and it just sort of sparked an interest in me i guess and i just grew from there 

Recording: (7772/ 9621) 
that you really can get a lot out of it if that is something you want to do and i think as long as you are involved with the school 

Recording: (7773/ 9621) 
they are good 

Recording: (7774/ 9621) 
well a quarterback is got a injury to his hand i mean he still does good he just he needs to focus in on who he is throwing at instead of throwing a fifty miles down the road he is done that a couple of times yesterday and uh watching out who he is turned to you know might help too 

Recording: (7775/ 9621)

Recording: (7782/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7783/ 9621) 
for example one of the issues that they were in the forefront on was uh justice for um the people in central and latin america yeah 

Recording: (7784/ 9621) 
well they pretty much put by the test scores they do not sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we are and they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting another student what the student still needs for the complete of that grade and once they figure that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder 

Recording: (7785/ 9621)

Recording: (7800/ 9621) 
i just did not see where it would be used utilize here 

Recording: (7801/ 9621) 
all i remember is them talking about condoms i do not think they talked about anything besides that but um then again i could be wrong uh but yes that i mean it is the stance but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they are a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have nuns or anything there i mean know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they would talked about condoms i doubt that they would have done that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (7802/ 9621) 
that movie was good makes you think like right now i am cold and when you see it you will know what i am talking about like coldness

Recording: (7808/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (7809/ 9621) 
that is what a small world 

Recording: (7810/ 9621) 
but the whole especially with the first few shootings you know with the children i mean 

Recording: (7811/ 9621) 
and it was pretty it was fun to be the first class in the school because everything is brand new 

Recording: (7812/ 9621) 
oriers that are out there men and women that will do that uh more power to them uh all i can do is pray them out and that is what i suggest to everybody else that is the most powerful thing that you can do even one of the nuns in high school that taught me had a post on the wall that said more things are brought in this world by prayer than will ever know 

Recording: (7813/ 9621) 
it is yeah 

Recording: (7814/ 9621) 
they will okay 

Recording: (7815/ 9621) 
and those little hot box tents those really do not count 

Recording: (7816/ 9621)

Recording: (7817/ 9621) 
when i threatened to take them to court and it took almost two months after that 

Recording: (7818/ 9621)

Recording: (7819/ 9621) 
yeah this was three years ago about three years ago in august there will be three and yeah it was however many was that an eighty nine or ninety or something like that well it is it gets more and more um like uh it is not like america but more and more like a regular democracy every year i mean not really but it is closer and closer a little bit 

Recording: (7820/ 9621) 
and the paris probably would have a pet pee am used to the and then there is the another hit list in my head obviously and another hit list in my phone payment and life is good 

Recording: (7821/ 9621) 
and i just told them what it has to do with my belief system say you are in violation of the first amendment you know so and then they realized that i was not stupid so you know they just made things more and more difficult for me you know so i just decided to since then we are going to change those it is just going to leave you know but so it is you know it is it is a hard way to choose to walk uh if you are an idealistic person and i mean just more so me i i do not like i said i do not try to dwell on the negative you know but uh it is very easy to get sucked into what is wrong out there and it is also very easy to get sucked into the attitude well i am going to change this you know if you can you do what you can do as a human being that alone is good enough 

Recording: (7822/ 9621) 
um i have been there twice already 

Recording: (7823/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7824/ 9621)

Recording: (7825/ 9621) 
i do not know what it is like to grow up in anywhere else i i know what it is like uh kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i would go up in columbus how do you judge that you know what do you compare that to 

Recording: (7826/ 9621) 
uh mostly accounting and things like that uh such as a count is receivers for nursing homes and things like that pretty in depth um some of the day by you know if i just go for a day it is filing and whatnot getting loans but most of the jobs actually you learn a lot so 

Recording: (7827/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7828/ 9621) 
one sixty one was like you know all new and this is the place i want to live you know 

Recording: (7829/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7830/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7831/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7832/ 9621) 
but even though you are not responsible i am not supposed to be responsible uh people you know that have the beer party in the house yeah they they should be held responsible to some degree but we are in a society that loves to sue people 

Recording: (7833/ 9621) 
well but then see i always look back and look at this there were how many thousands maybe millions of years before christ and here we are two thousand years after christ what makes us think we are not going to live there is ten fifteen twenty fifty thousand years beyond i can not believe unless there is some thing like this or planet colliding within another planet or something that would destroy everything 

Recording: (7834/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7835/ 9621) 
you know this apartment is where he is living and it is just god i mean seems like a hundred years old

Recording: (7838/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (7839/ 9621)

Recording: (7847/ 9621) 
get paid every week for doing nothing 

Recording: (7848/ 9621)

Recording: (7849/ 9621) 
thirty on it and his report card he is got like a one point two five average so they take jelina who has an a him who has a d and they go well gee the average kid in the schools like c plus and they are stupid at the school columbia like schools do not do any good then you go to double and worthy do not restableville in order to get there you you are not going to be in his condition and you are not going to be stupid because you are trying to you know you probably but husband and wife work so the intelligence is there and you are not going to have dumb people living and going to those schools because it is very expensive in that area so there is a natural prejudice that clark is stupid and worthy and double and and it is really not true it is just that you know you can not tell all the poor people and the people that do not have two parents do not come to school because when our scores higher but you know nineties and above but twenty five percent are getting absentees 

Recording: (7850/ 9621) 
yeah i um i mean i know so many people who you know they get pregnant get so are so conscientious about about what they eat and and uh i mean they will not take any histamines and hay fever season and you know so many things that they will not do and they are so conscientious about it it is hard for me i mean i i just do not know anybody who smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that on the other hand i think i think it is a choice and um i mean you you want to wanna try to help them you wanna make them aware of health issues but i mean a lot of women are not getting prenatal care either and and that is part of it and you can not you can not arrest them for that you just got to get them to the doctor 

Recording: (7851/ 9621) 
and so you keep thinking well you know they need more but i was hoping they could use that land for something else i do not know there is you know there is somebody not building but you know something maybe especially in double one but it is i it is probably gonna be good for climate 

Recording: (7852/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (7853/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7854/ 9621)

Recording: (7867/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7868/ 9621) 
umhumi just had a a healthy rigorous conversation last night with a town ship trusti jersey town ship which is just over in uh licking county and uh this gentleman is eighty three or four years of age and he is been to town trip trust he various times throughout his life and he is very very concerned because of the explodes pot and hit boy actually when back up he is a farmer has been a farmer all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres of jation to approximately a thousand which his son is mainly operating i uh he goes out and works too i helped out at at this age uh but he is concerned because they have just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developer to come in and already they are ready to take over a couple of farms that are fairly close to him but but it effects the whole township and one of the things that they left out as he put it one of the orders and he pushed and pushed and pushed he wanted a specific part of that ordinance to say every so many people that move into this area you must provide for a school and it said of consequences and and it said they did not do it it said i push and pushed and it said i uh i all the influence was on on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was going to produce more taxes but they kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you are not going to provide for schools so he was very concerned about that so here was a case in my opinion a very very honest uh politician but he was also being shoved away from what he thought was an honest approach 

Recording: (7869/ 9621) 
well clowncon is not there clowncon uh you could get like a bag of uh two of the rolls and pay only five cents so that is gone and um that was a kid thing um my grandfather used to own in a men market

Recording: (7871/ 9621) 
yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the 

Recording: (7872/ 9621) 
do you think 

Recording: (7873/ 9621) 
i do think there is some and i do not think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i do not think they would probably be exposed to you know the gave less being i i think that would probably just be blown over and they did not go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex classes were pretty but on the other hand for me that was fine i do not know our friends that have a eleven year old that is going to public school i mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry around with baby he went we went to hockey game with them and here he is was this baby of the soccer game and it was just like eleven 

Recording: (7874/ 9621) 
yeah he went to columbus public schools well you know i i am catholic and i went to catholic schools and so i tried that with both my kids catholic schools and uh for a couple years and so he was in uh catholic school couple years they got he got expalled because he is uh eighty eighty

Recording: (7884/ 9621) 
i did not like his life no 

Recording: (7885/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (7886/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7887/ 9621) 
like it is everything pretty i mean like basic stuff that you it would be a like you know like a laserist or something like that you know or or a bunch of places you know like electronics appliances uh uh 

Recording: (7888/ 9621) 
i have done it for the last uh about five years 

Recording: (7889/ 9621) 
yeah that could really bite you in the back though when in all that money i would be well i would be quite content with one million dollars but ten million dollars is kind of like a overkill i mean do you think anybody in this town has ten million dollars well maybe a couple of people yeah 

Recording: (7890/ 9621) 
they will like why do not you pitch you know be happy for the indians i am like i am happy for them that is fine but 

Recording: (7891/ 9621) 
but having having done it before you know and uh knowing where i went wrong you know uh that would not happen again uh that would been all that sort of stuff for while but but again that was back in the uh actually it was in the nineties the early nineties but you know i was been doing it we were we were uh the recreation type of thing you know not as a uh daily you know you somebody can knock on a door oh yeah okay well we uh we uh yeah i would not mind having to uh some kind of place for uh you know you see a lot of uh different down and out type people and everything and and really know about it or really trying to help them or not you know and uh uh i like to think that maybe even this thing you know could be like a say shower for them to come in and get some peace of mind or something you know um-hum 

Recording: (7892/ 9621) 
yeah humumagain i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out of of college and then you put them with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean you can not even you can not control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can uh put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and you know and they have got stairs up and down and you know they get in their lockers and they bend over it you know and that is that is just too much i mean i think that is the first thing that has to be done take away that you know they should not even be that should not even be a thought you know and it is distracted enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe there are single guys that were just had a you know oh what time in in college and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh well you know you got to look at that you got to be more aware 

Recording: (7893/ 9621) 
said stories uh let us see 

Recording: (7894/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7895/ 9621) 
oh the the the video tapes that i did not like it was not a class but it was the class was kind of goofy but um it was that and watching the experience which i am not a 

Recording: (7896/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7897/ 9621) 
she does not so much mind anymore i mean since i have turned eighteen i mean ever since then it is been no problem or anything i mean she is sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (7898/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7899/ 9621) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and the education than a you know than most of probably the people that this would um concern but i do think i i do not know i mean with the best control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if uh you know the the man is not willing to do it or whatever so and and and adoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7900/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7901/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (7902/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7903/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7904/ 9621) 
control problems of course there is always the lakes down there yeah well it could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant but about now they drain that it is drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so they might have drained it and that is why i quit run quick quick put plasticoh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here at a high state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of auto workers you think of pipe sitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of people and that is very hard to negotiate for anybody you know when you are talking raises and lots of money like this is what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades are not real big participants in the union you know we just ride along and from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here is it seemed that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the troubled maker employees around longer you know and so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice to and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you can out work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court and they will yeah it is against yeah it is against the union contract so you had this 

Recording: (7905/ 9621) 
um-hum they like me but then they do not like me 

Recording: (7906/ 9621) 
it is a good place they even stop playing the ghetto music this is juke box and it was horrible it played the same three songs with like horrible offensive lyrics and no melody whatsoever 

Recording: (7907/ 9621) 
i i do not think so but 

Recording: (7908/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (7909/ 9621) 
i wish i would these guys going to military school and so far you can know they have had problems before somewhere along the way whether it is academic or social are you ready to take on this additional responsibility no but we do not promote it again you may we got a separate we have academics for the university oh you are going to be a sport athlete over then you have got we have got coming into college i am presuming you were not an athlete 

Recording: (7910/ 9621) 
that might be 

Recording: (7911/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7912/ 9621) 
let us 

Recording: (7913/ 9621) 
and now now to 

Recording: (7914/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7915/ 9621) 
which is well yeah you know could have done that too 

Recording: (7916/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7917/ 9621) 
wonderful restaurants 

Recording: (7918/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7919/ 9621) 
i have never heard of it being developed commercially 

Recording: (7920/ 9621) 
and god only knows he would get a half a dozen drinks in and then he would go around the husband testing to say a few words for and we used to think kiss him out of the air you know 

Recording: (7921/ 9621) 
yeah just in their corporate offices and that would be fun so eventually i will have my own radio station if they interviewed me and knew that they would quick get that girl out of here no but that that is like the most exciting thing right now is that i mean that looks real promising but and if i do that then i am going to have to do something voluntary or some uh voluntary work or uh choices i i looked at that too that is choices for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be real interesting and help me feel like you know helping people uh they give uh new direction for abused uh wives and mothers and uh help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that 

Recording: (7922/ 9621) 
i hit my my head was that far below the surface 

Recording: (7923/ 9621) 
right right it probably went out of business when he left 

Recording: (7924/ 9621) 
that is cool 

Recording: (7925/ 9621) 
so it you know she would have been going to north when high school which is up there just well up where i am living in one fifty one cleveland area and uh so it would have been interesting yeah but then you know the in the other side of it you know the uh women tend to have the more emotional type of feelings on uh than men you know we carry on our shoulders you know so uh i i just hope she adjusted 

Recording: (7926/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (7927/ 9621) 
well we were we were at that we were in vancouver so it is not that far away we did not hear about it for a couple of days but i heard that it is all that was on every aspect of his life every aspect of the search when the people really need to know that do they need to have it driven home and i think then and i think at that point that is where the media are just they are sensationalizing it and 

Recording: (7928/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (7929/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (7930/ 9621) 
who do you think wants to keep you from from doing something that will help you because people that is land and indigent is tribes all over the world they do not follow the bible they have done pretty damn good you know and uh 

Recording: (7931/ 9621) 
yeah you just find it i can do anything i wanted yeah 

Recording: (7932/ 9621) 
um-hum

Recording: (8043/ 9621) 
i am not sure where my father would have been and my father was very liberal uh more so even than my mother um because if it is not something that is part of your culture everyday you know and and you have been told it is wrong and the catholic church said it was wrong as most most religions do i am sure he would have you know had some concern but i think his his intellect would eventually have worked it out especially if he sat down and talked with him and he would not have done you know there would not have been any gay bashing with him and um there would not have been you know what happened you know to the the black man in jasper texas and uh you know uh the the shepherd boy uh in what was that oklahoma uh yeah he would not have

no no he does not have anything he he will not talk to me yeah 

Recording: (8050/ 9621) 
they and they always what made me mad about it is because everyone always thinks you are mad at them 

Recording: (8051/ 9621) 
but she is out there somewhere you know we do not have again we do not have clear evidence where she is there are a couple of times where they where we thought we knew where samantha was uh i mean when there were all those clones of her uh i think that was in the second season or so um i think if i mean if they were going to end it they were going to have like three episodes in a row that just were tying up all these loose ends that they keep having i suspect they probably will not do that they will um leave things open ended for future tv movies or maybe another uh feature length movie uh 

Recording: (8052/ 9621) 
when i was teaching it that was kind of before all the moms went to work 

Recording: (8053/ 9621)

Recording: (8058/ 9621) 
that is 

Recording: (8059/ 9621) 
no i 

Recording: (8060/ 9621) 
it was um well it started out as uh computer science or the college of earth and sciences but then there was this whole four language requirements and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually i became a a proud number of the college of business 

Recording: (8061/ 9621) 
yeah and i am going oh this is really interesting you know and and i will drive along and people are just like uh well on the horn and i am like why could you 

Recording: (8062/ 9621) 
um i i see it as a problem and if i if i if i were african american i would i would not like to see it simply because uh you know it it a a child not being brought up in his you know in his tradition but on the other hand i hate to i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orph when he could have a home and um i think uh parents who were willing to going willing to adopt uh a black child or a mixed raised child or an asian child or anything are are going to be sensitive to the to cultural things because we are just you know it is just the the way things are slanted these days i mean diversity is an issue and people who are willing to venture out into uh mixed race adoption would already be way 

Recording: (8063/ 9621) 
yeah um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time i just went and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i did not go like under their insurance or on the same flight as them i just kind of met up with them

Recording: (8065/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8066/ 9621) 
for the system they have now keep bunching the old card data into that that was my first first library job 

Recording: (8067/ 9621) 
routine 

Recording: (8068/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8069/ 9621) 
well we started down there and france is just a goody two shoes so i am going to tell mom 

Recording: (8070/ 9621) 
was not really living i was actually serving a mission for my church 

Recording: (8071/ 9621) 
i think i did not know the difference so i did not affect me at all just they are just another person um i think more as i am being exposed to patience with the different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their care givers and what they need um i felt someone else equipped the first few times but um knowing what the expectations are especially like with brian card injury patients and when you go into sex reality and teaching them after injury i mean as in her she need to be able to educate them i felt pretty 

Recording: (8072/ 9621) 
and you screwed something up 

Recording: (8073/ 9621) 
we just started reselling 

Recording: (8074/ 9621) 
and that is been almost ten years so hopefully 

Recording: (8075/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8076/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8077/ 9621) 
about the same time my friend got hers 

Recording: (8078/ 9621) 
and that it was going to about to be restored again and so we believe that the true church is actually restored again to theirs 

Recording: (8079/ 9621) 
because i tell her things like i said you know what you really need to do is like in the morning when you are all done dressing you look at the mirror and go i look pretty good today or when you have done something like say uh she is in a play right now and when you come home at night you need to look at the mirror and go i did pretty good at the play today other people did well but i think i did the best i have done so far you know and and and it is not to make yourself an eagle maniac it is just a you know that is like those little subtle hints 

Recording: (8080/ 9621) 
yeah you know like when i worked in westernville i had bought my house because i used to work um off of the east north broadway and the freeway and uh i thought it was going to be there forever 

Recording: (8081/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8082/ 9621) 
it uh so she drove me all the way out of that county to next county where the pan cake places so she went out of her way and out of her jurisdiction with the southern hospital you just uh get me out of the weather 

Recording: (8083/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8084/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8085/ 9621) 
yeah yeah i that if if uh there there can not be sanctions for doing the right thing and um uh so i would be i am opposed to that i well yeah i i guess you would have to say that i would i would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything um in in in that relation that it is just that the effort should focus on i am getting them to stop but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they are doing 

Recording: (8086/ 9621) 
there we go 

Recording: (8087/ 9621) 
okay so how are you going to help them when they are all over 

Recording: (8088/ 9621) 
as a top and it is it is not intentional it is just the way he is so he was able to circumvent anything that the psychologist was trying until he had finally admitted that yeah he had a problem and then things went much more smoothly and that they are still not really convinced of the diagnosis because there is multiple problems and they have not ruled out that some of the other things in he could he just knew how to get around anything 

Recording: (8089/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8090/ 9621) 
but it was not because it caught fire and that time he was born on the back 

Recording: (8091/ 9621) 
no we we uh i generally try to keep our child to their child to uh you know there is a time to grow up and there is a time to be a child and then uh we divorced when she was eight years old so i would get up every saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that you know and try not to let her watch some of the ones i i did not like you know so and then on movies and stuff uh we would let her see some shoot them up movies and everything but the the weirdest movie she is seen uh was att i remember that i mean

so i mean it is that is what i am saying uh i i think it is even the american disability act talks about certain things about employers um and and with my lawsuit you know with the uh the shell and you know with all the public trials of high profile trials i think it is the education for everyone and now the illegal system sucks and does not work um is not fair it is a rich man is person or a rich person is system judges are bought and paid for they are elected um there is a lot of crap there and i learned all this not from just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys that there are judges down there that take bribes and that is that is not right so you can not when you are dealing with that system justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford and during my lawsuit that was very evident you know laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes and it is not right it is not fair but that is the way it is so uh i did not want to go on the wall did not want to go into paralegal i was looking into that and lady kept hounding me and telling me you know uh maybe you could get in it to make a difference i am like why would i want to make a difference if it kills me you know because i know myself and i do not put up with crap you know i see a lawyer i bring them out you know and uh i was just brought up to being an honest person and uh unfortunately there is a lot of people out there that you know they saw out their ideals and their principals for forty thousand dollars a year and then they use their family orumthat kind of person and i will not ever be um so if that means that i stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life and so be it you know i got a conscience and uh and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there but that is yeah that is basically where i have been you know um i have lived here my whole life like i said i went to college that played baseball um due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i just i was very i was pro calibut you know uh i played baseball with uh with paul and neil and kentucky which are a couple of guys that you know did get signed professionally and are playing right now um so i at least i can say i played against them and uh at least with camper uh i can say hit a home run off of him so that was a long ago but but was when he was young and very good and i was i was through four years older and still took him deep to center field so well i will never forget that but i i do not refer to it as an accident anymore you know there uh my whole life has changed uh in every facet uh from it um you know physically and emotionally and spiritual um we used to be catholic i do not follow that way anymore and um you know i follow more uh uh natural way of following uh nothing uh new age and i want to say exactly what you know just say that the people of this land long time ago before anybody came over here with their bibles and crap uh ramaged houses down people is third of the people that is laying out of waywarder and godness away i wonder what is the way i fall um so a lot of people say that is native american or say that is indian or whatever you know i do not care what they want to put on it but it is it is it is a natural way of falling god is the way i put it you know uhwoping that uh and respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and uh so i went through all that and all those changes and are still you know coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to 

Recording: (8100/ 9621) 
much 

Recording: (8101/ 9621) 
said to me that can not be wrong because the computer said that was a word i said that is a word come with me i will show you what a best of you are with 

Recording: (8102/ 9621) 
he is 

Recording: (8103/ 9621) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an infinite towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of uh not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much yeah yeah 

Recording: (8104/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8105/ 9621) 
and i i really feel like if you are going to run for president of the united states you ought to be smart 

Recording: (8106/ 9621) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (8107/ 9621) 
no that is one thing that i you know i have found was really lacking here uh for my son uh 

Recording: (8108/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8109/ 9621) 
he is really just yeah he does not think through the implications of things real well is personal life 

Recording: (8110/ 9621) 
i mean obviously being being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8111/ 9621) 
helps the curb 

Recording: (8112/ 9621) 
yeah it it says 

Recording: (8113/ 9621) 
i was working out there well 

Recording: (8114/ 9621) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (8115/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8116/ 9621) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8117/ 9621) 
how come with needs though is much people do not want other things to close i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (8118/ 9621) 
to me that was very strange 

Recording: (8119/ 9621) 
oh she is a cute she really is really cute i mean her being she is got big eyes and big fluffycheaks 

Recording: (8120/ 9621) 
it is always going to be somebody that can complain about something uh well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it is individuality again so 

Recording: (8121/ 9621) 
okay so people could like fly in do do their do their little waiting things fly out 

Recording: (8122/ 9621) 
yeah it is weird they uh this microphone is a little bit different so 

Recording: (8123/ 9621) 
that does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like i said just sort of gives me different opinion of it 

Recording: (8124/ 9621) 
you even got these uh what snuck guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (8125/ 9621) 
yeah jay and i and i went together 

Recording: (8126/ 9621) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (8127/ 9621) 
see there again the business out box the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another try to understand your neighbor more and spend time getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangible depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investment is gone 

Recording: (8128/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8129/ 9621) 
well that used to be where you know all the teenage teenagers went 

Recording: (8130/ 9621) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8131/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8132/ 9621) 
um i mean i feel i i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human right side was that if there you know on cocaine or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (8133/ 9621) 
because see well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talked about that the only you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (8134/ 9621) 
love it 

Recording: (8135/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8136/ 9621) 
no i mean the money you know the money is great you know fine it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to make campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and there thirty five million in the hole because they bought oh us used and all this but you know it is not the union is fault that they ran out the contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the job that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they are not willing to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always gonna have to have people here to because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order 

Recording: (8137/ 9621) 
well when you have formulas to make bombs and you know 

Recording: (8138/ 9621) 
it is in it is at the same building actually it is it is that it is used for different things 

Recording: (8139/ 9621) 
yeah i was when nineteen well i was eighteen when i went in but 

Recording: (8140/ 9621) 
exactly but i do there there is the other side um that uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from it well not exactly you are giving up your children and and and something has to be done but but there is also there is also that i i mean i think it is probably a legitimate fear that children are children of that group are going to you know going to be homogeneous out of out of their heritage but i do not know uh you know there are kids without parents 

Recording: (8141/ 9621) 
i mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military you know as long as people do not know that they do not feel threatened see and and i i i do not understand that mind set i really do not i do not know why uh a man feels threatened by having a gay near them uh i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know want to go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the height of arrogance um you know but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i do not know but it is not a mind set i have so it is hard for me to understand 

Recording: (8142/ 9621) 
four five six seven eight nine ten just to get a volume level 

Recording: (8143/ 9621) 
okay i might wanna try to adjust this a little bit again if you can get because on your lunch trip it is it under here so yeah it is probably gonna stay better 

Recording: (8144/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8145/ 9621) 
he would absolutely have to build my trust for a long time 

Recording: (8146/ 9621) 
it was probably the best thing for me 

Recording: (8147/ 9621) 
but i just did not hang out with the entire crowd 

Recording: (8148/ 9621) 
right and you can get it walking down the street 

Recording: (8149/ 9621) 
which every kid in the world plays with 

Recording: (8150/ 9621) 
so but you know it uh i think you know a lot of times you think well you know uh when you even know you sit there and start wanting to phone call away you know all you do is call me but it is not the same thing as being there and she is well i remember one time when she was having a stomach age she was like uh twelve or thirteen years old you know and i said what is the matter she goes uh my stomach hurts i said uh well you are on your period or what you know and she goes dad 

Recording: (8151/ 9621) 
there is 

Recording: (8152/ 9621) 
he is a he he actually he he graduated with a accounting degree yeah 

Recording: (8153/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8154/ 9621) 
uh well you have it upstairs and downstairs upstairs is the tower and there is like a uh ground control a clearance to every which reads all the clearances and all the airplanes and the ground control taxes them too and from the runway and the tower works everybody landing and department or any airplane within five mile radius then once they get out of thatuh radio downstairs which is called the approach control they work everything from there to ten thousand feet and out to about sixty miles and when they get to that point then they go to the in route centers 

Recording: (8155/ 9621) 
i have thought about that it is sad i am i have i mean that is why i have not went to college or anything because there is nothing in my mind has set on that i want to do in life i just want to be rich 

Recording: (8156/ 9621) 
every one is like you got to look it i am like well it is going to catch up just wait 

Recording: (8157/ 9621) 
well something that i i wanted to get into some kind of counseling with people that have been through traumatic experiences but i need to be at a point where you know i am in my recovery where i know i will not be sucked back down into their way of thinking um so it is it is a step by step process i i try to go into counseling for chemical addinctions you know for alcohol and drugs but the bullshut excuses i kept hearing from these addicts was just too much to take and even even the bullshit excuses from former addicts 

Recording: (8158/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8159/ 9621) 
but my son he just he is so uh i mean i do not know if you have ever met anybody that is totally into politics 

Recording: (8160/ 9621) 
then you get the shooting out in high onlyland the next day there is another one it is just kind of like that syndrome you know well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever um i mean i am not saying not to cover it but yeah and then course you have the whole gun control stuff that is just ridiculous 

Recording: (8161/ 9621) 
yes yes we stayed here probably probably 

Recording: (8162/ 9621) 
when i was a kid of neighbor yelled at me i better make damn sure he did not tell my dad 

Recording: (8163/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8164/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8165/ 9621) 
yeah he says he knows vm s as well but he does not like to do it so he does not do it 

Recording: (8166/ 9621) 
so there was a a waddy they call him it was like a little deep boy 

Recording: (8167/ 9621) 
right yeah 

Recording: (8168/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8169/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8170/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8171/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8172/ 9621) 
i think that is a cop out myself 

Recording: (8173/ 9621) 
it was nice actually i ate a lot more healthy and um it was cheaper i was getting money in my buck i would eat so i actually got paid every day 

Recording: (8174/ 9621) 
imagine it and that is basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually had her move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned sixteen so she was fifteen when she moved in with them she refused to change and i do not know what could have changed it if they would have got around earlier but basically all three of them i do not want to say are doomed but they are not even though they are out of that environment they are not doing any better 

Recording: (8175/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8176/ 9621) 
yeah but you still have to be careful and yeah 

Recording: (8177/ 9621) 
umhumi am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere along the line they would work things out to try to help her over those bums it would not be long term and they would know that it would not be long term but that is that intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not to make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bring about the spirit she is out in a person that is going to carry them all through life she is also um tithing more than tithing probably which uh i always uh kidding with people i said the author that said ten percent tithing new inflation he knew great about economics ten percent is ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we talk about economics uh a little further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the and the germans and so forth and uh boy you know taking a page out of the old bible are not they we do not 

Recording: (8178/ 9621) 
yeah because it is the midwest yeah 

Recording: (8179/ 9621) 
well like i am getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at 

Recording: (8180/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8182/ 9621) 
because that is more boring 

Recording: (8183/ 9621) 
um to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was you know there was uh i had a friend that worked for them so they did not know that and um uh he told me that there was glass in the back room that they were supposed to install supposed to have installed those five feet higher three to five feet higher and uh should have would have could have you know if it was up i would not have got to hit i mean there is no two ways about it but if i did not get hit i would not be where i am to spiritual so i do not refuse as an accident and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talked to uh went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised when i was raised and those people could provide me with any adequate things in terms of counseling i know they tried i know they did the best that they could but um there is a lot of things that the catholic church will not like to admit that they are wrong on and they are wrong um uh they will sit there and ask me to a tone for my sons yet they will not atone for the sons of all the police that are molested in children still to this day and they protect them and that is not right and i am very very uh outspoken about that so rather than bang my head on the wall to people that would not listen i just decided to leave the church i do not go there anymore the only time i have gone there was for my nephew is baptism and my grandparents you know and that is the only time i have gone in there you know i went to a wedding too but it is difficult sitting in there because of the way i follow now and uh and actually seeing things for what they are and it is frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that is okay um well the lawsuit uh we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher taller glass back there over a year so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they could not find the hardware to install it and uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and they built it overnight freight things uh if there was any kind of uh special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country there is no excuse you know so basically you know it came down to after it came to a legal battle which was uh i was not going to back down they were um i was poor monetarily they knew that so they were using the legal system to wear me down um the first uh at the date of filing i mean first of all it took i had a statute of limitations was two years uh i had an attorney and a law firm of representing but they were dragging their feet i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill you know and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet even though i knew the guy so i just said well look i am dissatisfied i am going to go fight another attorney so he will give me my file and see it and i went shopping around for a new attorney and it took me about seven before um seven attorneys before i found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a nurse surgeon and uh he had experience and expertise in uh bringing up the uh the differences uh and the reality of of a brain injury uh and the effects the wife long effects you know so after the two years we got in uh just under the two years so i mean hell that would be what happened in ninety three so just under december ninety five uh the day the last day of uh the statute running out we filed so we got it filed once it was filed the judge uh scheduled a hearing and for whatever stupid reason um the soon as they could hear the case was one year from the day that we filed so you can see when you get in to bed with you know and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit or whatever you know any kind of lawsuit uh the big boys to get all the brakes so uh in my opinion the judge did not want to hear the case before then or maybe his doctor was full but i am saying you know there is no priorization in the legal system there are some things that uh should be addressed soon uh should not have to wait that long but so then came down to one week prior to the uh hearing and i got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh an also phone call from the office saying that uh um that they uh were firing it to continues it which meant that uh the judge granted them an additional year of discovery um whatever the law says you know the judge says he has to back it up but so that post plan uh trial for another year which pissed me on you know but that is exactly what they were planning on you know wearing me down like i said knowing that i do not have the money to throw in there and say hey you know um but they know for a while that we had all the evidence that we had too so uh that just posed upon it for another year finally we got into uh coming in and then they uh sent a letter saying they wanted to meet uh for just for because of what the to see if they we could hammer out some kind of settlement couple months before the trial uh i was on a where that is common practice but you know it was very iffy situation um juries here uh in columbia have been ultra conservative uh they feel that people for some reason or another that people that have been legitimate injured in their lives have been affected that they do not deserve money for whatever reason um and i i do not think it is fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it has not happened to them i do not think that is fair um because it does affect your entire lot has otherwise i would be full time employed i would be getting full employed and making money and i am not and that is that is not because of anything uh it is by choice is on my part but it is it is uh you know there is a lot that there is a lot there the betrail that i have had to struggle with there is a lot there that um you know i feel i have been betraid by everybody that taught me i feel betraid by the the government by the legal system by the politicians by all the people that have been putting charge to protect people to protect ideals to protect principals for without the wonder for money and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt um it got down to just uh dollars and cents barering for what my life was worth and it is the bidding started a hundred twenty five thousand dollar now i feel a little more than that you know i feel you can not put a value on human life um you know there are just subtle things that you know my sense of taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half uh just all the drama that goes involved with it not just not just the physical drama i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength uh i was not killed you know um so the physical burden and i am still dealing with a lot of the physical pain uh it is gotten significantly less but uh the emotional pain was worse and is worse um having to have a you know a lack of money now means a lack of socializing means a lack of going and doing things um you know do not have any uh a lot of relationships do not have a girlfriend do not have a wife do not nothing like that i have got a dog uh golden retriever 

Recording: (8184/ 9621) 
much in school is that 

Recording: (8185/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (8186/ 9621) 
yeah and there is like a there is like a lot of kids who are who are different but just like not the majority or whatever 

Recording: (8187/ 9621) 
um like they are living together things like that 

Recording: (8188/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8189/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8190/ 9621) 
oh i can whip up a mean fish especially when i go out we a pattern on a certain kind of island i am not going to you know 

Recording: (8191/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8192/ 9621) 
right oh and i and i am sure it will especially when you already recognize that you know that if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you are going to be helping along it is a lot easier than trying to figure out what is going on here you know 

Recording: (8193/ 9621) 
and uh where my mom was a a young high school student just graduating from high school and so they got together there moved to california 

Recording: (8194/ 9621) 
my mother is family in man isville

Recording: (8196/ 9621) 
yeah it is russia in the year old mountains no not i do not even know where that is that is pretty terrible but i do not think it is 

Recording: (8197/ 9621) 
or listen hiked up her skirt and i rolled up my pin slug and well i probably not over knee deep but uh i think i have good talking to her is all we ever got out of it 

Recording: (8198/ 9621) 
yeah i was the second generation of his because he was like he was like fifty seven years old when i was born so probably the last thing he really wanted was another kid you know 

Recording: (8199/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8200/ 9621) 
no okay small world 

Recording: (8201/ 9621)

Recording: (8204/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8205/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8206/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8207/ 9621) 
yeah they they all get the option but i i understand very few exercise it so you know if they were to not give them the the tuition that they could that most of them are using and then giving the two dollars an hour you know but then that could then you could say that oh she is helping to keep people down and so you have to still it is it is an odd balance there it is and like something like that does not seem too skilled to me so i do not really know why there is much of a union for that but obviously the 

Recording: (8208/ 9621) 
and that is i think that is really a major problem and i think there is a lot of problem with young kids today do it my way or uh they all um hit them or 

Recording: (8209/ 9621) 
what was my kid 

Recording: (8210/ 9621) 
but it is just me you know i told i tried to tell her you know and i am not in any kind of writing special program or anything like that i am not a doctor that is or damn sure driving an eighty five truck

okay 

Recording: (8216/ 9621) 
yeah exactly that is uh it is a very conservative town in 

Recording: (8217/ 9621) 
that would be great but uh what i was most worried about was all the uh all the equipment and stuff those in the truck i mean there is a two thousand pound forklift back there and you are not going to just dodge that 

Recording: (8218/ 9621) 
oh yeah it is so much better to have it in an alley or sit down on your deck and look in your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we have got all woods and a creek and then the gulf course so so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside two seventies still so 

Recording: (8219/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8220/ 9621)

Recording: (8303/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8304/ 9621) 
that is too true it is uh 

Recording: (8305/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8306/ 9621) 
i mean i am all for anything i could do the sales i could do you know the purchasing thing i can do i i pretty much can do anything that will be i can be taught to do 

Recording: (8307/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8308/ 9621) 
i have been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up like herald and things like that um 

Recording: (8309/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8310/ 9621) 
a baby um a bible being which worked out was just a sweet kid in the whole world and um and my daughter was from collin to teach her and she watched jesse for a good three years during the day i mean i will call and pay her obviously but i mean and she really she really enjoyed that you know something that she could do at home you know she wanted to go out with my ear and she could take just with her 

Recording: (8311/ 9621) 
so they are really hypocritical 

Recording: (8312/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8313/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8314/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8315/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8316/ 9621) 
stuff like that 

Recording: (8317/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8318/ 9621) 
yeah it is my daughter yeah um-hum 

Recording: (8319/ 9621) 
you know what i mean it is uh i mean i hope we are getting to the place we know that that uh 

Recording: (8320/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8321/ 9621) 
i think my mother was okay with it all the conversations we had about since then we would be able to leave yes just did not dramatize her i i think it was kind of a no brander for her as well she is like ah yeah all your friends and your dad are all american experience that you do not know anything about and me talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair 

Recording: (8322/ 9621) 
not i not really i mean i do not think they would come to any more difficult conclusions than guys had coming up to 

Recording: (8323/ 9621) 
she will make she will make pico over a bed i do not think he has a lot of choice no 

Recording: (8324/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8325/ 9621) 
very much so 

Recording: (8326/ 9621) 
no i work for the company but i can solve on a lot of projects within the company um yeah we are doing pretty well it is about a hundred and fifty million dollar business 

Recording: (8327/ 9621) 
now if i shoot you then might do something i do not get me right but i mean if i shoot you then might do something but otherwise in that day i am going to do nothing 

Recording: (8328/ 9621) 
of the year i mean it just got to the point where i would had enough and i did not want to go anymore 

Recording: (8329/ 9621) 
um but they always say do not let the animals sleep with you know that and with the cat and they crawl up with you it is hard to say no but you know i i do not think eventually well it it took probably a year 

Recording: (8330/ 9621) 
badly i marketing is not my strong suit i mean most of the stuff that i get is just is an accident i started working for us who because another uh illustrated that they used to was not going to be able to do the work anymore recommended me you know that kind of thing but he was a guy 

Recording: (8331/ 9621) 
that 

Recording: (8332/ 9621) 
so the work that needs to be done 

Recording: (8333/ 9621) 
and then uh my oldest son is wife is a secretary in the in the school 

Recording: (8334/ 9621) 
so it i mean it he he is responding 

Recording: (8335/ 9621) 
so you know what i mean i am going to out last them 

Recording: (8336/ 9621) 
it is very difficult 

Recording: (8337/ 9621) 
yeah that is something uh copy uh doughnuts you know or 

Recording: (8338/ 9621) 
shopping you know it is but it is just become a really good metropolitan city i mean it is on its way 

Recording: (8339/ 9621) 
people too like when people order bunch of crap i just want to tell them like no do not do that like 

Recording: (8340/ 9621) 
to melt and soften the metals so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire you have ever touched or been around and that fire is sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down there with the laws and physics told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the firekeeper breaks them out of the out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they are red orange going you know tell me they are not hot so that is that is one example um 

Recording: (8341/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8342/ 9621) 
you know and they work hard you know to make it easier on the students you know they totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 

Recording: (8343/ 9621) 
well some of them are i guess depending on where they go but i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class that has not gone to preschool or day care and she said it takes that kid up till christmas to catch up with the things the other kids come in already knowing that is how far behind they are used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name and your address you did not even have to write it you just had to know how to say it in your phone number and um recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take a turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills and that was about all they expected you to play cooperatively um that is about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten they expect you to know all that plus by the time you get to first grade you are supposed to have but and oh the number she used to from one to thirty it used to be if you could uh say them in order and recognize them you did not even have to know how to spell the word or write them down now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred you are supposed to have twenty site words by the time you go to first grade 

Recording: (8344/ 9621) 
i think he needs counseling at that point 

Recording: (8345/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah and that is the way that is the way you really should be i mean uh you got to be ready for tournament time you know that is the way things move 

Recording: (8346/ 9621) 
for me personally um family being close uh both sides of family are here um for me familiar with from middle yard i do not like a lot of change a lot of new things um for me i was involved in i i swam for oh i was used to swimming and got real involved with it was just sports and just the sporting programs and i love a high state football so i i like the sports there are a lot of activities to do too now with my little boy going to coastline and the zoo and just knowing where things are and how to get around 

Recording: (8347/ 9621) 
so in uh in one way it is kind of a blessing 

Recording: (8348/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8349/ 9621) 
uh i had three months and then i got postnoted then i got postnoted again and i was like this stupid in exchange for post noting it again my rational was fine i will give myself another ten day 

Recording: (8350/ 9621) 
yes it does definitely he went on a mission to texas and he is he is been back for a while he is thirty two or well he will be thirty two in april 

Recording: (8351/ 9621) 
they can not fathom that 

Recording: (8352/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (8353/ 9621) 
yeah i did 

Recording: (8354/ 9621) 
really i have not noticed that yet hm 

Recording: (8355/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8356/ 9621) 
not directly but indirectly so i certainly did not want to be elected 

Recording: (8357/ 9621) 
um either real playing games 

Recording: (8358/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8359/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8360/ 9621) 
yeah i do not understand it i really have a hard time understanding you know they are not after you they just want to live a life 

Recording: (8361/ 9621) 
flowers and 

Recording: (8362/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8363/ 9621) 
oh yeah almost always does not matter what um the disability is and i do not know why this is but they used to say eight to one now they are saying more like five to one does not matter if it is the speech impediment blindness retarded through vivaldi definite learning to you name it there is five to one more boys than our girls and we do not know why 

Recording: (8364/ 9621) 
four or five 

Recording: (8365/ 9621) 
well at the time they are having a lot of trouble at school and they just want to get rid of some people 

Recording: (8366/ 9621) 
i am waiting for it i do not know what i am going to do but i am waiting for it 

Recording: (8367/ 9621) 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the scene and unseason i will never forget it because i decided to forgotten it was that many years but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about day a minute or spirit they freak out 

Recording: (8368/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8369/ 9621) 
um-hum umhumbut uh it was like i say i she probably probably thinks the same way now she would been here you know and have been with boys and everything you know when she was growing up and that part would have could have probably would have been an ass about that kind of stuff depending on how bad they were you know they laid a hand on her of course you know but but uh uh but by her being away you know and her mom is got her quite on her shoulder she would not let that happen unless you told me about it and she would be private for you to tell me that that catching airplane a flight down over there or something you know just to look the guy up or something 

Recording: (8370/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8371/ 9621) 
um and i you know they said well what if for a health reason they said you would have to eat meat there is no way someone could tell me that i would have to eat meat you know 

Recording: (8372/ 9621) 
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow 

Recording: (8373/ 9621) 
our school was not really a violent one there were not really any fights or anything 

Recording: (8374/ 9621) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh john kennedy died 

Recording: (8375/ 9621) 
watered watered 

Recording: (8376/ 9621) 
yeah now if you the the the thing you do is if you know the call sign 

Recording: (8377/ 9621) 
and then on out in the enemy was over there well they put us in the front of that mountain right down 

Recording: (8378/ 9621) 
his dad is a um oh graduate of stanford um but he is um they they never leave there i mean that is a excellent medical school and everything but those football players are smart they they do not they do not quit you know i mean it is amazing they they never do 

Recording: (8379/ 9621) 
um a lot of good investments a lot of saving a lot of living will balloon means i do not know six businesses yeah um he is definitely of retired he is basically um he does not have to work he does but she does not have to so he just finished up a term job up at uh class yeah i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now 

Recording: (8380/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (8381/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8382/ 9621) 
if you ever met somebody like that any 

Recording: (8383/ 9621) 
well it is well let us put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money on for government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could i could be a crook and uh i could have people rent me a house and allow him to come i could move in there 

Recording: (8384/ 9621) 
tv about it and everything that stuff been going on for years so 

Recording: (8385/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8386/ 9621) 
i so um chris and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got in my head and i did not want anybody to call and say how is your dad doing and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call globally across the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go because how often do you get to tell people so i i said hi how you doing ah no i have not talked to you in a little while there is everything on it actually no my my father killed himself this morning you are kidding so you you end up after a dozen or so people narrowing it down you are you are kidding you are not serious no 

Recording: (8387/ 9621) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they will not allow dogs so she is not allowed to go over there so she is always a but but it does make a big difference i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8388/ 9621) 
yeah that is uh the bureaucracy be too much of a struggle i think 

Recording: (8389/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8390/ 9621) 
you know so they offer to something in a med school here 

Recording: (8391/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8392/ 9621) 
it is the art school 

Recording: (8393/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (8394/ 9621) 
so 

Recording: (8395/ 9621) 
i have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (8396/ 9621) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with the bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems um and i mean that is really that is really all that i know is just obviously a lot more build up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (8397/ 9621) 
that that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8398/ 9621) 
real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 

Recording: (8399/ 9621) 
i thought it was forty three 

Recording: (8400/ 9621) 
you you got 

Recording: (8401/ 9621)

Recording: (8404/ 9621) 
so does next well i will turn me on the ends 

Recording: (8405/ 9621) 
as to what the sanctuary should be like so we had a tour uh the choir took a tour our choir director um arranged it to about six five or six churches in the columbus area to sing in them and not for an audience but just to sing and to see which ones we like the acoustics of and uh that was interesting we sang in uh we sang in central presbyterian church downtown which is where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them and what we did not maybe it had some feedback i think the new building is acoustically very good it is certainly much better than old workshop center because i do not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quote unquote type building in nineteen sixty two and it is yeah it is it is flat there is a flat roof with a clear story in the middle it has nothing in it just it is just empty space over the over the dealership center so when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front if you were under the high place your voice would go all the way to the back and but if you were under this flat ceiling that is only about seven or that is only about nine or ten feet high it was dead it was just muscle and uh it was terrible acoustically but you know we made do with it for many years and then um and then we had this chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is uh it is really beautiful it is a circular almost circular big uh space with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh it is it is nice well you could still go it is they will not have they will not have a lot of uh 

Recording: (8406/ 9621) 
so yeah those places were probably about thirty years old i you know fire hazards insulation just you know fire hazard everywhere 

Recording: (8407/ 9621) 
right and i think that you know i think that just because you know you do so because i know i have done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse has to have everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (8408/ 9621) 
well well yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with it it is like a form of censorship you know big brother things librarians have always had problems with that uh i do not know it is it is hard to balance it somebody is out there actually doing criminal work a criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that is to still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (8409/ 9621) 
um as far as my brother goes i can not say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town uh but usually he is either at work because he works full time then he has he is a part time student at columbia state um so i do not really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out does his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that 

Recording: (8410/ 9621)

Recording: (8413/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8414/ 9621) 
um i mean the fact of the matter is a lot of people out there i guess could be child molesters or whatever i mean it does not matter if they are straight or gay or whatever the fact of the matter is i mean they are they are out there 

Recording: (8415/ 9621) 
i know steve my husband sometimes i mean we have taken jerry out to the military a few times to go to the great side of his mother and he says you know very often boy she would really have liked to have been here and done things with him

Recording: (8459/ 9621) 
i do not have money and when i start dating people i have i have extremely expensive tastes for women and i like wine and dining people i love the opera and that gets real expensive for a while it gets real expensive after a while uh i am taking one class i am taking a an accounting class i had a real big mess academically um graduated high school with a three five is all college prep classes ap courses i got a really high iq extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that and it like i would go in and take an exam being back to go out and they did not even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did in my freshman year for one midterm or or one final and uh that just did not work when i got to college but i did not know that until i was done with my freshman year with a one point seven gpa about uh about let us see the middle of winter court i realized why i was in engineering i had applied to three colleges my senior year of high school ohio state on a whim for my dad who told me to apply there because i could get in without any trouble whatsoever naval academy and the air force academy no naval academy air force academy and west point are three of the top ten hardest schools in the world to get into you get into one of those academy and you are coming out as a an engineer that is what they all are i mean yeah there is other there is other fields but the best majority are engineers i like math and science so i figured whoa engineering i do not have any other options i must be engineering so i came to college and i got into the honors engineering freshman freshman engineering on the oners engineering program called the gateway program engineering is the hardest field to study besides probably from law or medicine and i went into the honors program that was a big mistake really really big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill i had all that freedom and i had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in a hand basket summer um spring quarter i switched my major to music because i am extremely musically inclined to it is one of the gifts that i have gotten and um that uh that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realize that just like acting you are all good ninety five percent of you are poor as dirt three percent of you are right in the middle and two percent of you are extremely wealthy and the last majority and like i said ninety five percent are dirt poor well i do not want to do that i mean uh my dad is a doctor i was raised in high society i do not want to leave high society i like it there i like it there a lot yeah and um so i was like hey but you get out of the better get out of the music thing so i decided to go into business but um i can not get into business until i get a bunch of a bunch of prerequisite courses out of the way because my gpa is on it is after this quarter i did really go this quarter after this quarter it is up to a two two two and i am not going to be able to get into the business school until i got a bunch of prerequisite it is out of the way and their sequester i can not take county to twelve and tell them that i am at eleven i can not take say i asked to hundred and to my one i told them it is a hundred and all that junk so i had to take the stupid class this summer because if i am going to get in when i want to um i have to i have to take it this summer i hate taking classes in the summer um because i would rather just i would rather just work and and not worry about the classes and then have a little bit of fun all summer long with all my friends but so i can work yeah rest my brain a little bit but i am still searching for a job it is not that i can not find jobs that i can not find the one i want i mean the job market around nine ten dollars an hour so i can get a full forty hour week and they will not have a problem with leaving at five oclock because i have a class at five thirty but that is what i do in the summer i am still searching for a job i would have i would have done some more searching today but i have had a few problems with my say tang computer 

Recording: (8460/ 9621) 
uh yeah it would be just one more thing 

Recording: (8461/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8462/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8463/ 9621) 
yeah no problem 

Recording: (8464/ 9621) 
hi 

Recording: (8465/ 9621) 
i do not have a good opinion of uh columbus schools at all no not at all 

Recording: (8466/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8467/ 9621) 
oh it is horrible because you watch it and you think 

Recording: (8468/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age too 

Recording: (8469/ 9621) 
just because it is been three weeks now you know and not only that there is uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and then you and you have to pay their full wages for the work that they miss 

Recording: (8470/ 9621) 
right uh-huh 

Recording: (8471/ 9621) 
um-hum it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is good it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to to sit back and let other people believe whatever they want to believe you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (8472/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8473/ 9621) 
i just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like you know you should get out before you actually fail the class and um it was it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that is what it amounts to not that i was not able to pick up the data i was just um oh it is uh unwise and and whether or not it was worthwhile and i believe that it is uh unwise and and whether or not it was worthwhile i believe that it is uh horribly worthwhile now and yet now i am not taking classes so 

Recording: (8474/ 9621) 
to deal with 

Recording: (8475/ 9621) 
i mean the way i grew up is probably like back in the day like the catholics against the columbus publics you know like the richies against the poories that is how i kind of see but when i went to northland people are think northland is like a rich school but the way i see it is no not really i mean we do live in a big you know house area you know the houses are like huge but um um i mean columbus publics they they got some work to do too like the other night i was watching tv and uh an elementary school overdosed a kid on like some uh i think it was a drug to calm him down so he is not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom even overdos a name because he they are overdos a name 

Recording: (8476/ 9621) 
and we hum them at our what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested in books and 

Recording: (8477/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (8478/ 9621) 
yeah oh yeah the five year old just after the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know 

Recording: (8479/ 9621) 
yeah it is the brady bill did not really do it for america like they thought i mean yeah you wait five days big deal go out on twentieth avenue and pick one up in five minutes you know i have seen all kinds of people carry guns that should not 

Recording: (8480/ 9621) 
but eventually when away i just i i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy you know 

Recording: (8481/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (8482/ 9621) 
um and it was nice uh just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and you know and one of them had four children one had like six you know i mean it was amazing because i thought well i bet they are not still married getting right out of high school i just was not interested in that when i was in high school at all you know i was ready to go out into the world and these girls get married so young they just have no clue about life 

Recording: (8483/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8484/ 9621) 
i delivered the columbus to spatch in the morning too so 

Recording: (8485/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8486/ 9621) 
he sure was 

Recording: (8487/ 9621) 
very often i mean maybe like there is like one or two that come during the year 

Recording: (8488/ 9621) 
oh yes yes 

Recording: (8489/ 9621) 
we were talking about this at work one day and i said you know i am surprised you think that way because i tend to be a little left of center on most things sometimes far left but and i said now this is not i she said it seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is that they do not want to go back to cuba not to the communist sort of but people i have talk to even extreme conservatives and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that the ones i have i have not heard anybody 

Recording: (8490/ 9621) 
and my youngest dog when i was grabbing a van because they said i talked to them and they said well we are coming to ohio in a couple of weeks and i said oh good are you coming to see us um well no we were not we were not planning on i said well why well we are not driving uh do not he is renting us a car well all that amount was my sister was renting the car but he was driving the car i said well well then how are you going to get to these other places and normally i would not do that i would just let it go well uh i i do not even think about it so it is kind of like 

Recording: (8491/ 9621) 
well i believe that is where it was originally set up you know so 

Recording: (8492/ 9621) 
well i am not the mayor or anything so i am not going to make any promises 

Recording: (8493/ 9621) 
make it a bill for her 

Recording: (8494/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8495/ 9621) 
he is like this robot 

Recording: (8496/ 9621) 
yeah i am at the end of it all 

Recording: (8497/ 9621) 
but then uh it is like that some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle and then you go you can not stop and not watch that you know and you and if i was in church of it i would cut some of it out it is not that important 

Recording: (8498/ 9621) 
oh probably my family my kids are here i have a grandchild now so yeah i like to stay close to all them 

Recording: (8499/ 9621) 
why should i do it for a year i not do it for a year just go down for the day and then come back to the up arlington night and left i like to do that um 

Recording: (8500/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8501/ 9621) 
very slow very methodical and we take them to dog and my husband is taken them many times for when they had to have cat or that operations you know so he is involved with the girls too 

Recording: (8502/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know that is so controversial i i mean i mean to the point i mean they shell them out up with panama and bananas in public schools and it is like well are you promoting sex an the uh 

Recording: (8503/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8504/ 9621) 
well like i am a philosophy minor so like if you look at like different ethical theories and stuff like you like there is a bureaucracy kind of that is what i found there is a bureaucracy of things that are uh like the in it is animal rights for instance like i can not if you come in a my house and rob me and then run outside i am not going to i do not like to kill you for stealing my property like there is aierarchy there uh for stealing another life that is why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is an animal the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other it so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is inaltimeable because i did not give it to you i can not take it back you never fourfitted that you never gave me that right so that is why i feel like i could never want that in it to kill another person 

Recording: (8505/ 9621) 
but it kind of helps actually because uh you have all the people in there who are not owners and they do not know how to like the partyingers they do not know how to study or anything so 

Recording: (8506/ 9621) 
oh see 

Recording: (8507/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8508/ 9621)

not in not in rome county is it minnesota okay okay 

Recording: (8513/ 9621) 
um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (8514/ 9621) 
short uh essay for for a test and um but the way that i would grade those would be pretty scientific i think you know it would come up with a rubbock and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for your mentioning certain things yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher who is had to assign or grade creative writing i am not sure i would know how to do that yeah

um sector and i think that is a good sign but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a lot of like between the low and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the right direction we have a a nice solid middle income middle income in middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the like i visited mexico and seems like they only had the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that uh that that economy is coming along too and i mean it it it will be it is developing itself which is which is nice i took it to where we uh a plant on there because my my my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the quote of like seven bucks a day but they get they get bossed into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because they are they like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then they will not be thinking about our quality and they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (8541/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8542/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8543/ 9621) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are gonna have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends but they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (8544/ 9621) 
uh-huh i do not know that they would use the information that they had it i i do not know 

Recording: (8545/ 9621) 
i know crash or anything but with rather scared kind of shaken up why it but um no they are very very serious about does not need a driver is 

Recording: (8546/ 9621) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools on that issue then yeah it i agree with the gambling thing you know just as long as it is like social drinking in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i i bought a one dollars lottery ticket one three bucks off of it so i kept my one dollar and uh got a one dollar ad and one yeah there is and then then they and then then there is these um little bit more expensive cards you buy the lottery cards one of them is called battle ship that i have won one lot of money off of 

Recording: (8547/ 9621) 
did not hear about that 

Recording: (8548/ 9621) 
and work later that which was fine by me or he called me and said said okay if i work all night and would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that 

Recording: (8549/ 9621) 
oh gosh that is really going around a lot 

Recording: (8550/ 9621) 
you always had 

Recording: (8551/ 9621) 
they set different rules up fine give me to where i am israeli

Recording: (8555/ 9621) 
yeah i know 

Recording: (8556/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8557/ 9621) 
um actually it is more it is almost taxed turned into like selfbusiness um like you said it started out with my dad and the people would ask me what i was doing i tell them and they think oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and so i go there and they tell people and 

Recording: (8558/ 9621) 
teachers couple teachers i take a bunch of kids every couple years they go to different countries 

Recording: (8559/ 9621) 
that would probably change my decision a little bit 

Recording: (8560/ 9621) 
well yeah 

Recording: (8561/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (8562/ 9621) 
and they fly checks like if you write a check today and you deposit it in the bank well that check has to go from your bank to clearinghouse and that is all they do all night long 

Recording: (8563/ 9621) 
you are ground it 

Recording: (8564/ 9621) 
yeah so basically i learned with him you all have to do this do that 

Recording: (8565/ 9621) 
a little geographic would not hurt 

Recording: (8566/ 9621) 
that is that is their job is to spoil them so the poor things i like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground yep 

Recording: (8567/ 9621) 
oh yeah and you know i cook meat for my husband i really do not cook red meat because he is on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soup a lot of good soup for them with meat and it really does not bother me to cook it you know i am not going to sit home and make it roast every night 

Recording: (8568/ 9621) 
already learned an awful amount looking at your real thing okay so bellgum is a 

Recording: (8569/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8570/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8571/ 9621) 
yeah she just likes to write stories and she is real creative that way 

Recording: (8572/ 9621) 
yeah yeah it would be good though because i could take care of the books and everything and do all that kind of thing so 

Recording: (8573/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8574/ 9621) 
no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go out and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence was in front of amaybe rate 

Recording: (8575/ 9621) 
oh that is an fortune she 

Recording: (8576/ 9621) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade in eleventh they are a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they are going to have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know oh i am going to play in a rock band you know they all think they are going to be rock stars and drumers and and you know they could care less about anything and it has not hit them yet this is my real life yeah this is my one real life better not throw it away they waste time you know they lose the stuff 

Recording: (8577/ 9621) 
yeah and and everybody is going to associate with the people that they feel comfortable with so you know and fortunately as that guy this guy in particular was a center for the football team as he grew up older you know uh you realized that he was not as big as important as he uh he blew out his knee for uh oh you you know but i went to i went to school with larry hunter who is the uh basketball coach for uh ou now and uh and he had the same thing happened to him that he had a scholarship around you and both of his knees were shot and everything but uh and he was a good ball parker probably one of the best ones i ever seen and uh rival like a larry bird you know back in that day and everything and uh but one heck with north sky you know never let it get to her 

Recording: (8578/ 9621) 
yeah and it was like i do not know that that state is notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night 

Recording: (8579/ 9621) 
i think um the people who have already graduated they like to the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation like among adults it is just that the kids want to go it it is just thought of it is a somewhat party school 

Recording: (8580/ 9621) 
but i do believe if you know when you are in love and you love somebody you will not you will not cheat on them 

Recording: (8581/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8582/ 9621) 
that i wanted them to file charges on him and they said well no uh he is not met the criteria i said well he does not get to school sometimes the lunch time they said well he gets here just in time to not be counted um party or not party but 

Recording: (8583/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8584/ 9621) 
do not realize it 

Recording: (8585/ 9621) 
yeah that is what i that was your question are we going to have dune we are going to have a catastrophe we are going to get this thing turned around before we have yes uh i think we will uh but i do not think we are ready to turn around yet i think we are still well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four or five times i it is coming up on a so rapid they i strongly predict that in just twenty years and possibly ten each and every one of us in the world are going to be interconneed with one another but once again it is an impersonal uh interconnexion i will be able to contact you when you are over in paris and i will be over in in ogde ohio and out to our own farm and i am probably watching the geese women up and down to the little lake and you are sitting over there in paris having a uh coffee or something something yeah it does 

Recording: (8586/ 9621) 
fast a sucker on those braces 

Recording: (8587/ 9621) 
my husband here all my life um i uh right now i do not do anything uh i had a head injury in ninety three where i got hit with the hockey buck and uh had had a uh chill hockey game 

Recording: (8588/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8589/ 9621) 
uhi do not know if you know who she is uh 

Recording: (8590/ 9621) 
i grew up in massachusetts ohio i am the only to five children i have four children my own i am uh i was pretty i was married many years ago and then i have been married to my husband now for twenty one years and we have um three children together so i have a dollar twenty eight dollar nineteen as a sophomore to high easily and my older daughter is a graduate from high i am a graduate i have a son who is uhlet us see joe is fifteen he is a sophomore at high school and i have an eighth grade daughter at and um i am a homemaker i have a degree in sociology i have been at home since my uh second daughter was born with my second marriage and i consider it a luxury and a privilege and i just absolutely love being at home i do a lot of volunteer work um i am real involved with the school system with columbus public and uh i like organizing big projects for them um my husband is director of engineering for labor and so that is why i know what you are saying he i whenever i can plan about the weather in columbia he always says well go anywhere you want where would you like to live well i want to stay here i do not want to go anywhere yet until all my kids are ready and then my daughter is always say okay mom as soon as we are all done with school then we can all move to california but we have to go out with a group because i am real real close to to my children 

Recording: (8591/ 9621) 
yeah it is not like there is a face behind like the music but not so much too you know it is not like 

Recording: (8592/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (8593/ 9621) 
some of them transfer from up north and audis and indiana and just different walks away you know 

Recording: (8594/ 9621) 
and i just can not imagine i had dogs and cats we did and i loved it and i just think kids need that and it is just a different kind of love i think you know they learn from it and 

Recording: (8595/ 9621) 
um probably would have been about six years ago i ran in sixth or seventh grade 

Recording: (8596/ 9621) 
i did have a a parttime job i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go fulltime and i just did not feel like i wanted to go fulltime so i was working as a receptionist and uh answering the phone doing some light filing just a variety of task office type task and i really liked it i liked the hours but i did not want to go eight hours compared to four so i left 

Recording: (8597/ 9621) 
and it is it is one color tax that no pictures so you always ask you what things look like and then you do not can not tell them and too it is like the computers are all screwed up like you type in you know like type in computers and it will say we do not have them but we obviously do and like then you will look at it in a different way and you will be able to find them like it is uh that is really weird i understand 

Recording: (8598/ 9621) 
are you sure i 

Recording: (8599/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (8600/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8601/ 9621) 
i think there is a heck of a lot more to it than what we will probably ever know um you know they are they are really having checked into the background of the parents you know as to what their beliefs were and everything uh and i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something accidentally happening and where some kids shoots another kid you know and and the parents are are responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately went in to kill and they wanted to kill more than what they killed uh then they killed themselves so we never know from there in point why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you know uh from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down there they could have been making him making him do it you know 

Recording: (8602/ 9621) 
i am from here columbus ohio yeah 

Recording: (8603/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8604/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8605/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8606/ 9621) 
i think it should be the parents responsibility but i have no objection to them teaching it somewhat in the schools i guess 

Recording: (8607/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8608/ 9621) 
well i mean 

Recording: (8609/ 9621) 
yeah i know i know i know 

Recording: (8610/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is that is interesting 

Recording: (8611/ 9621) 
yeah he he uh was a a a great advocate of uh old woody you know so he probably learned quite a bit from the old general you know 

Recording: (8612/ 9621) 
no no i really do not i have done i have done a variety of uh different things and then also um just reading and and things that since i have been off and i wanted i wanted to go back to school i thought about that and i wanted to do something with kids i almost thought of opening my own day care center but then i did not know if i wanted to get into that and 

Recording: (8613/ 9621) 
i uh his wife is a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information uh that he works with well i think she maybe uh retired last year but she had a a top columbus for twenty years or something like that and so i think it is information is good but i guess 

Recording: (8614/ 9621) 
prodict certain things but they they want everything to be the same they can not be they can not be the same it is just a natural thing but the thing is let them do what they that is a god given town what you have there kind of nurse and how many refuse a nurse voluntarily do they have children why talking about your women why do you you have why do not want to you have the natural ability to give all the all the natural protein the amuseation things all that maternal milk why can not you instead of getting off the shelf 

Recording: (8615/ 9621) 
and then back of our house about i do not know five hundred yards there is a man made lake 

Recording: (8616/ 9621)

Recording: (8620/ 9621) 
well because you know 

Recording: (8621/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8622/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8623/ 9621) 
yeah what goes on in the community 

Recording: (8624/ 9621) 
i do too 

Recording: (8625/ 9621) 
uh it is a high school trip uh she is in eleventh grade 

Recording: (8626/ 9621) 
because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict for a while 

Recording: (8627/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8628/ 9621) 
it is so dirty i usually clean it up more umi really really hated one of these streets and once you get the hang of it they are a blessing because you are in downtown and all of a sudden thinking to you are thinking to you see like twelve green lights in a row you are just like you go as fast as you can and try and get through all of them all at the same time no mind you if you are doing that anytime during the day it will not happen because you have got cars all around you but at night it is pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right to the middle of downtown um improvements i would just say keep i would just say the same thing is place is dirty 

Recording: (8629/ 9621) 
something better high school 

Recording: (8630/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8631/ 9621)

Recording: (8633/ 9621) 
she is disabled uh she is got she is in a car accident she is got what is called myrofatial pain syndrome or something like that it is from she had spanked on giants when she was a kid and it was brought on because of that and then plus she is got a glass eye 

Recording: (8634/ 9621) 
it was we had a little gallery um we were in clintonville for a year or so and then we moved to grandview and it was just fine art we call it fine art crafts and it was hand made stuff from local people and we had a lot of jewelry and pottery and silk and painting that kind of stuff 

Recording: (8635/ 9621) 
you know he says that he equals nancy square and i say it is eagles nancy cubed because the world is three dimension it is not two dimension uh two dimension limits everything but you look at his stereo relatively all of our mathematical theor physicals physical theor on physics and things of that nature have been based off that 

Recording: (8636/ 9621) 
no i think we are only friends inside the class i mean a lot of them i have known from middle school and falling them up in you know they just all go to different places like the one girl i was friends with that apart i mean she was a great lower than me but when we would seen each other in the halls say hey with something and and we would talk and you know what is going on and we are doing this after school and that and high school i did not know anything i i knew she was bad and that was it 

Recording: (8637/ 9621) 
i know that is okay i i you know i just do not want to touch it they just 

Recording: (8638/ 9621) 
it was just like that i am telling you what and we would see you know they would put things on the on the screen for us to watch i i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very a very good experience i went through very good 

Recording: (8639/ 9621) 
well i do not really like the i do not i like i really do not like that job but uh you know i like the people there but it is like uh way too busy i think 

Recording: (8640/ 9621) 
uh the bb is due may thirtieth and graduation is june second 

Recording: (8641/ 9621) 
a two girls are used a little across the street from me we are gators still we are a good friends of mine they live down the circle guy across the street is gave i worked in a gave bar one time i was the only straight person in there every girl walking in her she would come right to me no offense 

Recording: (8642/ 9621) 
that would be good 

Recording: (8643/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8644/ 9621) 
oh i do not really think so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but i guess i do not i guess i do not i do not get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i do not yell and scream at them and i mean realize they did not ask to have a learning disability i mean and then they can not they are not some teachers think are just being bellgerant and if they wanted to straighten up they could and what i try to tell those teachers is they can not change their learning disability anymore you can change your brown eyes you know they were born with it is genetic someone else in their family has it they can learn they just do not learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way it is like teaching a math problem in two different ways you get the same answer but one way works better for you well that is how they are you know maybe they do not learn well by listening maybe they do not learn by well by looking at a chart or something maybe they only learn well when they are up moving around doing something you know you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours and totally some of them might be totally screwed up like they might hear half of what you say or they might jump a up what you say and you say turn a page three ninety three or and they turned to three thirty nine in their book you know and they think they did what you said it is just like something is mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk uh for one day in their shoes you probably have a lot of empathy for them 

Recording: (8645/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8646/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8647/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8648/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8649/ 9621) 
but they would not you know because my daughter was like um a real lovely out going you know people person and she got by with so much at school but she is you know worked it is worked out fine with her with both of them actually 

Recording: (8650/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (8651/ 9621) 
and just to shows the ignorance and so many people you know and so that really still bothers me and there is there is still still so much of that going on you know 

Recording: (8652/ 9621) 
well i know uh when she was about twelve or something like that uh when the twelve thirteen fourteen range you know she became real violent with her mom 

Recording: (8653/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8654/ 9621) 
it is not it is unifying and i just wish they but i guess there is a rule out there i have asked uh abc news why they can not promote the uh these uh you know they they show the restaurant here here is their great point average engineering major fine tell what the majors are tell what these kids are what they plan doing they are not all going to make it to the professionals then what to do do afterwards they get token jobs because of connections 

Recording: (8655/ 9621) 
i would say for the most part that that not is not really true 

Recording: (8656/ 9621) 
go out and have fun person 

Recording: (8657/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8658/ 9621)

Recording: (8662/ 9621) 
yeah that was a little late though when i got here well 

Recording: (8663/ 9621) 
uh maybe maybe i like i said like it is really weird most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because i have lived in ohio for so long but when you are little is when i think you learn loyalty like i love the old detroit tigon from the eighties and like that is what i learned to to like 

Recording: (8664/ 9621) 
i grew up in climas

no thank goodness or if i did i would blanked it all 

Recording: (8670/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (8671/ 9621) 
uh brass feeding there was a lot of that i think it is all these programs it is like oh we need to talk about this you know they are all kind of uncomfortable um 

Recording: (8672/ 9621) 
no one to like check up on you in your dorm room i mean you are pretty much in control of your life at this point 

Recording: (8673/ 9621) 
yeah and i do not know what else is set up like yeah they might connect us they might not 

Recording: (8674/ 9621) 
what are they like 

Recording: (8675/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8676/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8677/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8678/ 9621) 
they believe in him they power that that fear of him and power his existence when you got like minded people around you know you can create a spirit 

Recording: (8679/ 9621) 
every time she thinks she is got a fully staffed and everything covered somebody quits but uh and that is what the main problem is been 

Recording: (8680/ 9621) 
uh the little girl sitting there going well i mean you need to go help seven like seven nine times nine sixty three you know for time table and stuff you know so uh yeah she like younger kids to with kids you know and you know man you are just the only way to you you you screwed up your life you are going to you are also screwed up your kids you know i was twenty well i was thirty one when devon was born so mine actually was twenty eight so we were both older not that it really helped as far as 

Recording: (8681/ 9621) 
yeah yeah and you do not wanna listen to any music with words because then you will start singing the words and then you will not be able to read 

Recording: (8682/ 9621) 
yeah one more thing to deal with on the other hand it beats it is you know growing up in fifty foster homes or an automobile 

Recording: (8683/ 9621) 
that flipped me out now i could not handle that that i am not ready for that i mean that was crazy she was twenty three the first person i have ever dated is older than me and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like dead serious she was hundred percent sure i was the person she was going to marry and i will see her at church every so often and she will come and give me a big hug she is like i miss you i am like well i miss you too and not probably the way you miss me but i miss i miss you you know oh uh she is in lubbock no no no no no no i mean she is a she is a great person she is a good christian but there is some things about her that i would not want in my wife x now and that but uh i have been single since uh um probably march and i am probably going to stay that way for a while mainly because i do not like anybody enough who likes me i like it that way i do not 

Recording: (8684/ 9621) 
i usually do not have trouble talking 

Recording: (8685/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8686/ 9621) 
uh so uh that is what i did and i went to some uh foster homes and things like that and uh lived in delaware for a while you know got out of high school and got married 

Recording: (8687/ 9621) 
talk to people yes 

Recording: (8688/ 9621) 
why people 

Recording: (8689/ 9621) 
exactly um-hum 

Recording: (8690/ 9621) 
oh

Recording: (8722/ 9621)

Recording: (8723/ 9621) 
humum 

Recording: (8724/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8725/ 9621) 
uh-huh right there 

Recording: (8726/ 9621) 
you know to get a a four or five dollar a year tax cut 

Recording: (8727/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8728/ 9621) 
uh should be but there are needs the students that are at the other end and need to help to a lot of people think if you have a child that is gifted that all your problems are solved it is not it is a different set of problems there is personality works that go with that emotional issues 

Recording: (8729/ 9621) 
i will raise them the best way i can 

Recording: (8730/ 9621) 
during the depression my grandfather um moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (8731/ 9621) 
ready willing to do that again 

Recording: (8732/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (8733/ 9621) 
yeah it is like the uh the woman that used to live in the apartment where we lived before us see she had a husband she was married too for quite some time he got on ohio is number one dewi list with eighteen dewi is man can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you think your first ti offense would be about a thousand dollars fine in weekend in jail or something but eighteen of them and you are racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (8734/ 9621) 
civil rights um um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an allusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal and fair society um maybe somebody left as positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where where in the social stradom you were born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these class i mean i i do not want to say class lines because that has so many like historical connotations because it is not the exact same as say class was in the marxist sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual 

Recording: (8735/ 9621) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and and with um my husband he is it is he is the oldest so for everybody 

Recording: (8736/ 9621) 
i do not know where i am going to fly into honestly i am thinking it was between a career flight 

Recording: (8737/ 9621) 
so yeah 

Recording: (8738/ 9621) 
or limited very limited 

Recording: (8739/ 9621) 
it is an island but it planned it together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show the show and this happened with deep space night too and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspect of the stories do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects um but uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know i i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh blyan and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (8740/ 9621) 
but other than that much dirt so uh whenever they we heard any firing like that was coming toward us we we had for that whole 

Recording: (8741/ 9621) 
we have a five hour course the first term of summer quarter 

Recording: (8742/ 9621) 
yes yes you might make millions you could retire young really 

Recording: (8743/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (8744/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8745/ 9621) 
i did not know that 

Recording: (8746/ 9621) 
totally left that part out no one felt me in about and i was throwing up or anything that that really made me mad 

Recording: (8747/ 9621) 
i just think it is a different time now i do not think uh i think everybody is living more for today in talking about the future you know hoping it to future is there i think there is a quote unquote uh in time aspect to life you know 

Recording: (8748/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8749/ 9621) 
okay good 

Recording: (8750/ 9621) 
like trying to cram organic into my head and 

Recording: (8751/ 9621) 
what did you spend most of your time doing besides snorkeling 

Recording: (8752/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8753/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8754/ 9621) 
but you understand what i am saying it is you are going to have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to concealed 

Recording: (8755/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8756/ 9621) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about you know i mean what is to prevent them from going to find out what some companies doing what research is and that is a that is a threat on the web too is that you can connect it in somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you can you know it is corporate espionage and i am sure that is going on and i have heard cases of it yeah well and the thing is people are real sharp no matter what you do they will find a way you know that is nobody is found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (8757/ 9621) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (8758/ 9621) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked by arranging my life around her so that even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with them 

Recording: (8759/ 9621) 
well they were none of my friends that were pregnant and i am not sure they you know i just remember a couple girls that were pregnant i do not i were not was not friends with them and i am not sure about who their boyfriends were or anything like that 

Recording: (8760/ 9621) 
a building or some car that that we could see 

Recording: (8761/ 9621) 
yes um we are both i have gotten kind of bad uh but my husband is a marathon trainer i try to run with her at least two three times a week because she is he is too fast for her um but we go to like hoffman farms up and off of costneride hilliard i am not sure if it is in hilliard but um we take it on to the toyota park 

Recording: (8762/ 9621) 
my father moved here yeah 

Recording: (8763/ 9621) 
um-hum but the third trouble is we do not fit the horse with the proper carryage load and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a team there is no sense having having five yards in a basketball team if you do not have a uh can tip it off and rebound 

Recording: (8764/ 9621) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (8765/ 9621) 
well i i starts with with allowing uh how there has two mommy is 

Recording: (8766/ 9621) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunchtime because that is the big meal of day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (8767/ 9621) 
it is just a rule 

Recording: (8768/ 9621) 
there was this one guy and uh so i do not know how many several hurts were you you know higher uh i think they were mexicans 

Recording: (8769/ 9621) 
so it is very parttime and i am a full time student so i was working somewhere else before but it was i needed somewhere on campus 

Recording: (8770/ 9621) 
where she works and this is just the way she is breast cancer place so 

Recording: (8771/ 9621) 
you just keep going that is part of life you pick up something and you learn it and you keep going 

Recording: (8772/ 9621) 
eating away 

Recording: (8773/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8774/ 9621) 
does not have anymore than like exhaust or bait or undrowdedly i will tell you that 

Recording: (8775/ 9621) 
um yeah across the street is a dental and a hospital so people were really loud down there 

Recording: (8776/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8777/ 9621) 
basically they did not legally adopt him or anything but they are the ones that he considered his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad but it is always kind of a challenge for 

Recording: (8778/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8779/ 9621) 
why are you doing it now but and then my my by youngest one she likes to dress totally different she is sort of like uh a little bit of a preppie but she uh does not understand why people want to have like eyes out on their shirt or you know a name on their pants and she says i just think that is stupid she says you can buy nice clothes without that so she is neither one of them pressured her me and uh the one thing that was really odd when they were little is we would go like to toys her us and up and down the rows and i see kids that is like you know and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walking and it is like you know i told you i says you know i feel like i am an oker because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goes no she says they do not want it she says they just want to see what it is like you know because their favorite toward when they were little is i would go to um what do you call it lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofa and the chairs and take a knife and cut doors in it and they would play with that for weeks you know until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident and then they would go well we have to build a new house but you know they just reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoy it you know so 

Recording: (8780/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (8781/ 9621) 
sure 

Recording: (8782/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8783/ 9621) 
so i was like in shape very well i was in very good shape 

Recording: (8784/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8785/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8786/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8787/ 9621) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know 

Recording: (8788/ 9621) 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too um uh i never i never did it and i you know wish i could have waited until i was married but uh you know you are going through that whatever you go through when you are a teenager so you are like so what well most kids i am not you know some people some kids still do that but i think i guess i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (8789/ 9621) 
i work at uh company plus i help out at the bva and on betters association 

Recording: (8790/ 9621) 
yes and no i mean in high school there is a bunch of little things here it is not so much a lot of things 

Recording: (8791/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (8792/ 9621) 
everybody needs to know that information 

Recording: (8793/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8794/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8795/ 9621) 
now this most of my painting were completed uh before uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before it came back out it was more of a thing like image from my childhood coming back out and now it is suddenly uh you hear about it more often so that is not a little funny about it used to be probably i have painted star wars 

Recording: (8796/ 9621) 
high on their horse yeah some of them are too 

Recording: (8797/ 9621) 
yeah i can i can imagine 

Recording: (8798/ 9621) 
i know exactly 

Recording: (8799/ 9621) 
yeah uh-huh 

Recording: (8800/ 9621) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to um enforce that so 

Recording: (8801/ 9621) 
hopefully 

Recording: (8802/ 9621) 
no no i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes it is the parents it is the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before before the health class did but if the parent is not going to get there it is the only way they are ever going to find out 

Recording: (8803/ 9621) 
that is what we figured a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean this times when we did not know where he was for a week or a week at a time he i was driving a uh a lane avenue once and so i am baking money on the street and that is it is it is pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (8804/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (8805/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8806/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8807/ 9621) 
in the meantime you know you got to pay the bills so i you know i am not sure what she wants to do she is had so many different kinds of jobs parttime jobs though hm you know i when she was younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show 

Recording: (8808/ 9621) 
but you know with people coming back later and saying that uh you know you change your mind and stuff as the adopted parents i would be concerned about that but that is not going to happen in this case i do not think and the because it is for age and the six and there is sense to me the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so that you know they are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not want to take the baby home because they are afraid of being too attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic uh they 

Recording: (8809/ 9621) 
because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (8810/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8811/ 9621) 
no 

Recording: (8812/ 9621) 
actually you can have well they usually go together some kids have learned disabilities without the eighty eighty and some have eighty eighty without the learning disability and some have both and you can have eighty d without having the hyper active part you can have attention deficit disorder with what they call high pro activity and that is the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they are kind of like out of touch with the audi and they are always looking out the window and like the other one that says i did not hear what what was the question and uh they are they are edd and they can not quite focus and they can not screen out the distracted but because they are not hyper they are not always doing this and they are not bothering people they are kind of the they are the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle those are the kids that are real cooperative and they are always smiling and they are kind of spaced out and daydream and and takes a long time to realize and this kid can not focus but with the kid that is all over the place and doing the tap in this kid is chair and the kid goes make him stop having my chair you know you you can see right away that he can not focus because when you are he asked you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he is like all over the place while you are explaining he is not listening you are trying to show him something he will not look at it you know it is like people often say add kids can not focus or can not attend anything but what is really happening is they attend to everything 

Recording: (8813/ 9621) 
five stars what is your major you know needle painting finger paints journalism and uh medicine okay crosswords okay i guess our uh younger people old cementors look after does not it and where are your scores and those are oh i am uh gee i am just barely getting by curse words yeah but that is a problem we have lack of standards no that is their right keep a private but no i wish those guys would just spell hey i am i am majoring in accounting i am majoring in finance i am majoring in business and i got three point five i got two point six oh and whatever the criteria is to play on the the team why are not you playing this week well i am practicing i am still required to practice even though i can not play this week why can not you play it is it is a rule what rule well if i do not make certain things during the week which is academic i still have to perform uh sports wise to make that commitment but if i do not fall if i fall through that then i will have the team period but those are things that need to be uh publicized more and they say well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and you got this scores and this percentages and that we need to expand more on that so that the younger people have better role models to look at and not just playing round ball or the the spro we need to get them out there and say how you are going to perform in school you know i am sure michael reds got some mentor out there you see guys were number five and where were number is at eight and whatever it was okay they there is a reason for it but what is what is what is the other part of it we do not do it because why we do not want to bring it up and we do not want to bring them so long it is embarrassing possibly or but that is part of life when they get out in the real world i am talking about these guys some will be successful in terms of whoever and some will be successful in other people eyes but the thing is show the kids air watching them hey there is more than just sports sports is a by probably care of the high state 

Recording: (8814/ 9621)

Recording: (8880/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8881/ 9621)

Recording: (8887/ 9621) 
by the minor league hockey team the columbus children or they do not have it now but uh because of blue jackets came in but but i think it would be good if it goes but i am just not sure that columbia is going to support something like that that is basically a high state you know and they are not even support the uh hockey team we got for the high state you know and yet they are good 

Recording: (8888/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8889/ 9621)

Recording: (8903/ 9621) 
well i mean most of it was me going over it with him and just you know i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and you know just doing the things that worked for him as an individual 

Recording: (8904/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8905/ 9621)

um-hum ten thousand dollar fine oh man talk about cutting a coupon there rain 

Recording: (8907/ 9621)

Recording: (8908/ 9621) 
difficult to find 

Recording: (8909/ 9621)

have you ever heard him speak 

Recording: (8913/ 9621) 
is that right 

Recording: (8914/ 9621) 
you know i did not realize because i used to love peanut butter you know on toes and crackers i go home you know it is because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and that you know it kind of satisfied me but uh this doctor took a couple test and um he realized it was the peanuts which i would never thought of that because i ate it for so long all my life 

Recording: (8915/ 9621) 
two years of senior in high school i mean there was not anything too serious it was just more i guess a test off your own trip or something 

Recording: (8916/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8917/ 9621) 
yes it is still democrat 

Recording: (8918/ 9621) 
yeah by then it was junior year when we were wrestling versus d and everyone just figured it was two more years left they could just struggle through it 

Recording: (8919/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8920/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8921/ 9621) 
because they would not let him when i was there 

Recording: (8922/ 9621) 
yeah talking about all these under age kids thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen even up to eighteen years old to column by shooting i mean all those just relate in one category that you know it is getting out of control here they will do something 

Recording: (8923/ 9621) 
and fired him 

Recording: (8924/ 9621) 
uh-huh yeah it is an old an old eyesore that they should have got rid of years ago but 

Recording: (8925/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (8926/ 9621) 
so the the original father did not living around for the kids 

Recording: (8927/ 9621) 
um-hum right 

Recording: (8928/ 9621) 
yeah it is a good idea 

Recording: (8929/ 9621) 
the court 

Recording: (8930/ 9621) 
but then again i feel like sometimes i am so naive i mean a lot of that was not introduced and it was just like well should i have known that 

Recording: (8931/ 9621) 
yes they do 

Recording: (8932/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether owned it or not he is never said anything if he is but uh i think money attitude would be uh do not tell them you know uh the the guys that come out very vocif just forciferously in favor of uh publicizing it and all that i do not see what they expect to gain i mean it is they they do not think that they do gain anything by uh 

Recording: (8933/ 9621) 
yeah so a new grandma 

Recording: (8934/ 9621) 
i think the one of the things that we when when you are baptized is that you are really supposed to help other people to like if if somebody gives you a gift you want to give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weirdos you know they do not wear a makeup or whatever but we we can wear a makeup if we want but so i think for a lot of times people do fall in just sort of but i i was not raised at mormon so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i am just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so and i am also not afraid of people who are not mornings because i think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be a more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught uh i think a lot of the you know we do not drink alcohol we do not there is a lot of restrictions i guess you would call them restrictions but they are out i feel like they are were not just health codes just keep you healthy and so um it might be it is like if we if america you know we are we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might want to get to know the chinese people but you might not quite be a little timid about you know same kind of thing but i i am not i do not have any of those barriers 

Recording: (8935/ 9621) 
wow i mean 

Recording: (8936/ 9621) 
peddling but uh 

Recording: (8937/ 9621) 
a couple that are adopted to be able to get counseling for her 

Recording: (8938/ 9621) 
when you are fifty five or or is it sixty two whatever age is it age limitation or you base one age or disability or being out of town uh you are allowed so routinely we have do done the out of i mean done the uh absentee over the years no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have uh i think the vast majority uh are truly good honest people they try to mean well i am i am concerned always that uh people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start but the tremendous influences are brought to bear that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there and they are just overwhelmed it it i do not necessarily think it is a it is a a dishonesty it is like a title wave they get caught up and they can not resist the direction it is being put or they are being pushed 

Recording: (8939/ 9621) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular so we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixties sound like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we have got these problems 

Recording: (8940/ 9621) 
i mean you need me to 

Recording: (8941/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8942/ 9621) 
whenever it comes on i roll my eyes that episode where they were stuck out in space and uh just if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes 

Recording: (8943/ 9621) 
and then i am probably going to be working on my portfolio of the second term 

Recording: (8944/ 9621) 
or northland 

Recording: (8945/ 9621) 
and uh so i got some of the inside dope on the area from him but uh they had they are uh i do not know whether it had been a large greenery or something that had a concrete floor and some industries ti had chipped a whole about so big around and that 

Recording: (8946/ 9621) 
yeah okay yeah it is only it is still ten till seven yeah 

Recording: (8947/ 9621) 
well yeah where we are just send a if you get sent to one of the tv rooms and have like uh oh for one first time we are gonna get it all over the world you know over the united states or something so people really hear it but maybe it would might do some good if people would begin to speak up you know uh why do not they start some type of a television program with questions like this and much people really think it would help to do instead of having things like oprah ryan who is because there is other couple guys that get on asked the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (8948/ 9621) 
which i have never done i do not want to but to me some drugs should be legal some drugs should be illegal but to me alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs 

Recording: (8949/ 9621) 
hom uh sexuality i guess 

Recording: (8950/ 9621) 
no i mean 

Recording: (8951/ 9621) 
but at the same time i do not think i would really hold it against him 

Recording: (8952/ 9621) 
my gosh it is one of those that i like you know falling out of trees 

Recording: (8953/ 9621) 
and we would uh adjust the guns called down shifts till they could come within reasonable close to that 

Recording: (8954/ 9621) 
uh because she has been known to help herself to bread we were like brain dead after this raise and my husband took her and we know about her but we were like you know after you run you are kind of like good and she actually jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread and i am like oh my gosh 

Recording: (8955/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8956/ 9621) 
you know 

Recording: (8957/ 9621) 
yeah and i i get to argue about stuff there here i am just kind of sitting around 

Recording: (8958/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8959/ 9621) 
you like the university level 

Recording: (8960/ 9621) 
actually being able to to recent the funding but still i mean it is a it is we do not like to think about these things happening 

Recording: (8961/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (8962/ 9621) 
and i do not know whether i am a i do not think a second sister ever went to school out there but uh things were so tough that and mom had taught school in iowa where she grew up and uh got her teacher is certificate so i guess in dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with i skied through the day she could teach 

Recording: (8963/ 9621) 
no not really i do not know what even is to eat down here obviously is 

Recording: (8964/ 9621) 
well um let us see i got divorced when my oldest was three my youngest was about six months almost a year so i have i have raised them basically myself yeah so i did go back to work 

Recording: (8965/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (8966/ 9621) 
it is just like bingo numbers 

Recording: (8967/ 9621) 
um it is kind of funny you are allowed to drink before you are allowed to drive 

Recording: (8968/ 9621) 
i was baby you know under one 

Recording: (8969/ 9621) 
there is too much information and too much change uh libraries is you know this is against probably what the image of libraries are they are very very eager to him for his change uh internet came out and you know when it and when it got out of the area of it was being used by universities or whatever for research that sort of was at first libraries were right there and they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they can do with it uh when pcs yeah we just you know it was it was revolutionary when we announced that we were going to use ibm pcs to access to the system and we would provide you software you can do some of the work that you are just doing with us in your computer and it is like it was incredible and and we had trouble with the demand it was you know like triple what we expected librarians were ready for it 

Recording: (8970/ 9621) 
and uh it it is great we have been re engineered last eight years old out downizing and trying to fit the uh uh fit the i guess the attitudes the person brings to work as opposed to uh one of the problems we see as an as an employer or at least as supervisor manager and a lot of times we have to promote because well the bureaucracy says you have to do this and order to go up there they do not take the consideration the attitudes the person has and so now we are saying okay if you bring this attitude to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you is that put you over here in let us say a man is jury jury opposition which you we do not have any call for but you are there because of the money only okay so we are trying to fit the attitude to the person and compensate them accordingly which hey i think we did that we would probably have more teachers 

Recording: (8971/ 9621) 
and why do not people use their time you know and it is free you know rather they get all ten stuff and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of their way because they got to get there you know 

Recording: (8972/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8973/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (8974/ 9621) 
and the house smells wonderful you know it is like cakes uh birthday cakes you know i think but my i think my wife was was the last one i i make her one and you know we we tried off and i bought a um uh what is that betty crocker at odd lots it was twenty two cents the iceing was twenty two cents i made it and everybody goes this is really good it is like a sour cream ice thing and i am yeah they go boy this is really good and they go did you buy this and i go no i made it and they go really and i go yeah it cost me forty four cents 

Recording: (8975/ 9621) 
there is no need to attack students over it and i have read some article in the lander and i do not know why i read that but um i hate that paper but anyway um i have read some article that the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get a noise so they will go fine to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment and 

Recording: (8976/ 9621) 
but like if you said i we will have a bus service we will go and pick you guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse me car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them a like does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you run three shifts you just you know here is a box of doughnuts and some milk or something you know and that does not cost the company that much 

Recording: (8977/ 9621) 
no i i am just a player you know i mean they lost uh four or five different uh top notch players that went to the pros and most of them are starting or you know so uh old cooper is thing is we do not rebuild or unload you know well sometimes it takes a couple years to unload you know but i have never been a guy i was thinking of cooperier so they just said some stupid things sometimes i was listening to uh uh not corby uh some show on wtv and i listen to talk shows and everything and uh he supposedly has said something to uh he had got rid of two assistant coaches so it is supposedly said something to one assistant coach said that you know i would like to hire you and everything but you are not the right caller you know i mean that is not something that you would think ahead to coach at a high state would say you know 

Recording: (8978/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (8979/ 9621) 
and the tubes and all that i mean i have never seen that like in eighth grade and look at that thinking that is me you know 

Recording: (8980/ 9621) 
uh-huh i learned about them from uh somebody i was working with who liked them and listened to a lot of their music and he loaned me some and i taped it and i saw their video their wall street corolla video i do not know if you have ever seen that it was fun it was fun 

Recording: (8981/ 9621) 
um i helped them set up different things helped them you know clean them up afterwards prepations all kinds of different things there was a lot of blood and stuff but i do not know when you when it is not you it seems a little easier to observe i guess you know when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning to you i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and you hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know she works she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that and that is a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there is so many different factors there you are you know it she says it is so hard to see somebody thirty years old and they come in and they have a breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says you know two or three times a week you know your your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and now you are going to be going for chemical therapy radiator all this stuff you know and it is unbelievable how many it is just hard to believe how many people go through there they are talking fifty sixty patients a day 

Recording: (8982/ 9621) 
you know and i mean it do not matter to me whether you are black or white it matters me whether way you treat me like when i first got out of services when they really started a third year of action i was going to get a job in the truck industry and they could not hire me because that was when they first come down on a man date that they could only hire blacks 

Recording: (8983/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (8984/ 9621) 
the risks in what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone the high part of it 

Recording: (8985/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (8986/ 9621) 
and it is interesting that they advertise that when you go there though if you get that room that is what you get 

Recording: (8987/ 9621) 
so and they they they they could tend to but they will they will eat all day cats yeah you just you just you just that you just you just put a bowl of kidding jow yeah that is all that is that is that is their life you know 

Recording: (8988/ 9621) 
i went that went there for career center in high school and that was something that was exciting for me but that is totally all the question for me now because i have a kid and there is no way i would do that 

Recording: (8989/ 9621) 
so like thirty of them will go out at one time and thirty will come back well that is not too bad but they are mixed in with everybody else that is normally flying like all the airlines and stuff so and they want to get their asp so you know i i just do not feel comfortable doing that much at one time i mean not that oh she was not a was not a uh dead place you know it was very busy it is like the third busy is in ohio but uh yeah it is amazing and they are only open sixteen hours a day 

Recording: (8990/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8991/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8992/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8993/ 9621) 
um actually i guess it is something that is always sort sort of been there i have always been real big on just building things i mean been real big hands on and last summer i helped my dad uh build a garage into his house um like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything like build everything up from there and it turned out really well and i mean it was really fun to do i mean it is i like it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time 

Recording: (8994/ 9621) 
gun control i am not really too interested in i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns on the street big huge guns and they are one of the safest nations in the country then you look at england they have no guns at all and they are relatively safe so you mean 

Recording: (8995/ 9621) 
yeah get my loan sharp control 

Recording: (8996/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8997/ 9621) 
oh yeah that is fine thanks 

Recording: (8998/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (8999/ 9621) 
she will be nineteen september 

Recording: (9000/ 9621) 
um i would not know that long 

Recording: (9001/ 9621) 
you know because everyone what did he have to hide and then like the fact that he did not know like i think on international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president he did not know the three leaders of the world thing and then on top of it like texas is a fairly big economy but still like to manage an entire you know an entire economy 

Recording: (9002/ 9621) 
oh definitely definitely well i have never had a dog and i have always wanted one 

Recording: (9003/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9004/ 9621) 
and it stays with you for years they do not realize that nobody tells them until after the 

Recording: (9005/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9006/ 9621) 
like i am not i am not really sure like how they how the interview works to become a teacher um i do not know i think it is like a lot of times they are really desperate to find people and so they really just take whoever i mean they are lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place and they are doing well enough i mean the kids are learning material i mean sort of i mean i mean it is working well enough i guess i mean it is uh like people are learning things and like wanting to go into college and stuff 

Recording: (9007/ 9621)

Recording: (9021/ 9621) 
well 

Recording: (9022/ 9621) 
i mean uh not who was not picked on you know 

Recording: (9023/ 9621) 
and she got divorced when i was three 

Recording: (9024/ 9621) 
you do not you do not use coupons 

Recording: (9025/ 9621) 
which is not really not a lot 

Recording: (9026/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9027/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9028/ 9621) 
and you can go visit what the empire is that the big thing like the stature liberty 

Recording: (9029/ 9621) 
it is yeah because pediatricians are able to dispose it and um um i just you know felt like trying to avoid as much as possible you know growing up 

Recording: (9030/ 9621) 
but when you look at home and he things there was a point where they they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (9031/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (9032/ 9621) 
i am i am been impressed i am like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look anything 

Recording: (9033/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9034/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9035/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9036/ 9621) 
yeah i think so i think so and like they neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me you know so 

Recording: (9037/ 9621) 
it is probably family by family i mean that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was there there we have got two coworkers one um has her child with the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and i am listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she is dropped off at six am and not picked up until six thirty pm and she is fine with that i mean personally there is no way because somebody has totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you under that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and she is gonna go she is she is gonna quit her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (9038/ 9621) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she is still that she lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i did love to cook 

Recording: (9039/ 9621) 
i think society uh today uh today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being violent but back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down in the south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks and there are bad whites too you know so but not all them are uh you know are that wet 

Recording: (9040/ 9621) 
um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally number one it is really hard to and secondly it probably will not kill them like a gun can um and you have to use your brain so i did not come from a hunting background um but my husband does work for the state high patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um in a lot of them they respect them if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people where you do get guns it is the problem it is the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9041/ 9621) 
so i am sure that probably creates the right in public schools for 

Recording: (9042/ 9621) 
um i do more summer sports but um he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer literer i have really never had a job yet it is always been working with food or plan 

Recording: (9043/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9044/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9045/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9046/ 9621) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign uh in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who who voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that had not and i had people waiting at a phone bank and i would call them at work or at home and and i would offer to take them to the polls if you do not have a ride uh we will take you to the polls if you are worried about you know someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and we will babysit for you while you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are rounded from their home or their office you know and to remind it to go vote we will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was as a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is roberto i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and though by the way uh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school level and if you need a ride let me know we have got them set up for you and but you know that is very i mean and and that is not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that is a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is important maybe because we have had it too easy my my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there was a king and queen and you know he had no right to vote so when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him you know and that he just passed it on to you know his daughter my mother my father i do not know how he it was important to him but it was always important to him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes we talked about issues and he said you know it was important to to be heard so i do not know if it was that it got passed on parent wise or what it was 

Recording: (9047/ 9621) 
uh about fifteen minutes my mom and i do not go too far from each other so but jameson is going to take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (9048/ 9621) 
that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i have been cross trained or however you want to say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raises and i have seen me get two percent raises when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (9049/ 9621) 
i do not know to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what is true so 

Recording: (9050/ 9621) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised um which classes is i think this was in the better introduction to the arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty note at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at the school before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her average was going to be ruined and she mean i was grading on it pretty much of a curve too i mean i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was that was attempting to do the work i think i flunked one person that was really goofing off and uh but in terms of a curve i had a is i had b is i had a few c is yeah so yeah oh well 

Recording: (9051/ 9621) 
well when you get into the black population you will sometimes see some 

Recording: (9052/ 9621) 
whether they are play a video game where they are shooting people i can not say say that it is being something that affects them 

Recording: (9053/ 9621) 
that is uh 

Recording: (9054/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9055/ 9621) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (9056/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (9057/ 9621) 
just get me a couple of shirts or something you know she always bought me clothes anyway so since getting me a couple of whatever you think i need you know i will be here drinking beer watching sports 

Recording: (9058/ 9621) 
little girl i i always think you should name a kid i have opinions about everything see i think you should name a kid something that will fit him at eighty three and eight and in between like we named our son robert so when he was little he was robby now he is eighteen he is robb when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert paul you know and in kindergarten all i had learned to write was r o b or r o b b y so that it you know i have a hard time picture an eighty three year old woman as a tammy 

Recording: (9059/ 9621) 
it is actually not that difficult but 

Recording: (9060/ 9621) 
i am the only one on my whole block 

Recording: (9061/ 9621) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a little if you are exch hours for money or time for money then you have a fine amount of time and that is 

Recording: (9062/ 9621) 
uh well i think only because i went abroad i had basically one extra quarter beyond four years 

Recording: (9063/ 9621) 
so that i guess i do have some family by marriage but they live near bloomington 

Recording: (9064/ 9621) 
in option 

Recording: (9065/ 9621) 
then 

Recording: (9066/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9067/ 9621) 
that is how i feel that is that is what i believe i just believe 

Recording: (9068/ 9621) 
so i you know i i just think the more you are open about things i just think that is the best why you know when you put things and do not talk about it that is when the problems start 

Recording: (9069/ 9621) 
hum 

Recording: (9070/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9071/ 9621) 
eg it 

Recording: (9072/ 9621)

Recording: (9082/ 9621)

tests one two three four five five four three two one 

Recording: (9115/ 9621) 
and i think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh is is colored by the fact that i collected data for twenty years from employers uh i am a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing um yeah i just a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 

Recording: (9116/ 9621) 
and my own civilian terms i said why would you want to give up an original you know why would you want to give up an original and have a copy because all these others wanna be well in other words you can follow christian day 

Recording: (9117/ 9621) 
the people who who really like my work happen to be the people who are vacationing from columbus so 

Recording: (9118/ 9621) 
they wear those tomatoes or do they wear like a like a is it like a way real 

Recording: (9119/ 9621) 
and i do not think that it is just executed properly so i would almost rather have it not at all 

Recording: (9120/ 9621) 
no the problems are only given out that day even the teachers do not know what they are going to be and it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood or it might be something as specific as when you were little what toy was your most favorite and you have to write five paragraphs on it so 

Recording: (9121/ 9621) 
i do not know what he pays but i know that he parks clear out over off of oldentalia river road and has to take like a bus in 

Recording: (9122/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (9123/ 9621)

Recording: (9126/ 9621) 
studing music for a while and then studying chemistry yeah no i i i did not think of any projects where i can use both 

Recording: (9127/ 9621) 
pretty well they are 

Recording: (9128/ 9621) 
it is it is amazing and that is something i know my husband we always joke about he talks tells his guys at work you know like um you know to take flowers for no reason you know like like one guy was telling he was saying some of them were ever in virginia and peter said well i can take flowers home and he kind of goes oh i do not know and he said trust me take some flowers 

Recording: (9129/ 9621) 
well they are supposed to do more too but by the time they get the fourth grade they are so busy trying to be the class clown they decide it is a lot more important to impress your friends and it is to fill your mind with knowledge 

Recording: (9130/ 9621) 
it it would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving first of all how much are they earning how much they expect to pay for a house and all these other things you know they they say to you well i will say the temperament church then you got oh gee five dollars here or made twenty cents and twenty cents an hour here you go this you figure all those up all these campaigns you hear during course of year i thought that would be great for marketing take all those figures and add up and see as it adds up to a hundred percent and if it does then where are your goals see when i bought a house the finance here came in and i went to his office and he said oh i said no problem no problem you can get that house i said a can yeah you are professional and your wife is professional i says that is how you are evaluating it on both of us yes i said i do not want to do business with you why i am going to give you a loan i said i do not want to do business with you because you did not ask me about my goals my goals was not to have my wife work because nowadays it takes children to work it takes children to work i am just wondering when they are going to try labor law to be able to that because but to them working i am wondering how many more hours a day you can squeeze out a couple personal life so they will have sanity at sometime in their life to enjoy life when these people start realizing hey it is we are chasing our tails then those two that that couple got why is it said hey we are going to do with less and we are going to go for quality when that when that couple reaches that mentality mister knowone officer you are going to have a greater society to work with and you will not have as many of your possessions sorry it goes against your goal but it goes against it it is more positive our society and that is been it my wife is been working parttime all her ten years that is fine keep her license up she is nice but the is i do not i did not want to i wanted to be home with the kids i did not want somebody else from your kids and i do not know if our kids realize this or not but i do know my my my brotherinlaw mentioned to his uh parents that gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us and he is just turned fifty and they do not have any kids and he says well i do not know how you do it well for one thing they probably did a lot of sacrificing and when you sacrifice it becomes you makes you more humble 

Recording: (9131/ 9621)

uh but thewow the only reason i get thewowpatch is i do one that what is going on locally 

Recording: (9139/ 9621)

Recording: (9140/ 9621)

Recording: (9145/ 9621) 
yeah it is ridiculous i mean plus it is a nationally recognized school so a degree from a house state i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone is at least going to recognize because of the big big big name ashland it would be more of a cell i would be like okay we it is small it is private it is credit but still 

Recording: (9146/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9147/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9148/ 9621)

Recording: (9151/ 9621) 
wow

yeah if they want if they you know choose i am i am sure there is you know women that are lesbians that have been with men also you know they have been with the men and then they have been with the woman now now they have got a girlfriend so obviously you know and i feel like that was because they they had an attraction towards a woman so now they think they are a lesbian i do not see i do not that is why i think so i do not think that but if that is their choice that is their choice so i do think they could change 

Recording: (9169/ 9621) 
totally like the directions and the homework and everything is all one hundred percent injury 

Recording: (9170/ 9621)

Recording: (9174/ 9621) 
not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was living there ten years before she married and uh got involved in a youth group and i think that that was very influential on her decision and so she was not married in the church all my other children were but you know she is she is going her own path and that is fine with me she is very good girl i am she is very conscientious and 

Recording: (9175/ 9621) 
we like teach english to little kids or or help clean or work at libraries or different things 

Recording: (9176/ 9621) 
it is 

Recording: (9177/ 9621) 
they they go out there and there was a i suppose in a county seat town and they flail a claim on a certain area of of land uh it was surveyed off and marked off in sections a section of land as uh six hundred and forty acres that sounds like a lot of it is a good size area 

Recording: (9178/ 9621) 
have you really have you gone to see all the shows 

Recording: (9179/ 9621) 
and then we would go do what we wanted to do 

Recording: (9180/ 9621) 
and you know i just really think they need to make that an uh an option for a young girl i really do because there is just you know there is just too many men when had children there just is and that really bothers me that we do not have another option like another country um we are a lot more right wing here in america but i just feel that is got to be an option you know for these young girls it just really does 

Recording: (9181/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9182/ 9621) 
chancees or shreve whatever from alli female so that was her name from alli she thought boy they are nice in this country they even named my baby for me people are so stupid

right 

Recording: (9186/ 9621) 
and they leave and you get either another ass whole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good 

Recording: (9187/ 9621) 
that and the people that enjoy you think what are you why are we hiring these guys you know what do they what do they think 

Recording: (9188/ 9621) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school than you know just recently i guess it was not in the biggest numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kids would die even more than you know seven or whatever and i think that the media is just made it into something that they have glamorous it and some of the kids i think they are screwed up anyway and they are just like well hey you know i can do that and i will be on the yeah i do i think that is the big part of that because they want their name known and they do not care if they die anyway uh-huh uh-huh 

Recording: (9189/ 9621) 
actually they are they are working on it i am sorry did not mean to i am trying to um they have they have um just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty let up level i think is considered um thirteen thousand pounds a year um and if if you are below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonus beyond yeah so there is a bonus for back to work you mentioned earlier about like how this would affect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system there for for whatever reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but um there i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really you know taking care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like their kids see none of that money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered you know and you know there is you know a lot of there is there are documentaries on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your face than it is here that that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if if a kid has bad behavior or you know bad tenants that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighborhood shoplifting buying you know hot wiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do not know i think i do have sort of very strong opinions about people you know who are having all these kids and do not take care of them at all 

Recording: (9190/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9191/ 9621)

Recording: (9206/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9207/ 9621) 
as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it is yeah i mean when it when you come down to these things there is uh people with mental illness and with the disability are trying to plan off a responsibility on to everybody but themselves you know well the medical doctors if they would have seen this guy and given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody you know she would have would have cut him in if the guy stopped taking his medication of his home free will that was his responsibility to take the medicine every day just like it is mine to take mine every day and when i stopped taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there is a there is a some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case they bought a house or signed in to some kind of contract that they would not be liable 

Recording: (9208/ 9621)

Recording: (9218/ 9621)

uh and at least it gave you a lot different few 

Recording: (9222/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9223/ 9621) 
it it might i mean good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity base teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at doubleen schools which was supposed to be one of the better schools in the area and i thought there would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read to chapter to write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence from the media uh and i say media broad based and you would be at print media or tv uh that has this culture today of um stars and you know media of uh phenomena and and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is where it comes from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they are not you know again i do not know what the the answer is um but it is very scary what is going to happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me is i think about this is that i will not be here to see the disintegr of the democracy although i have great faith too i have great faith in democracy um there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue i think kids would get if there were kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people did not think was important or had no real relevance to their lives i mean i think the kids would would rally immediately the issue right now is that there is nothing there 

Recording: (9224/ 9621) 
i exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home in high school and i was too busy with college prep and you know what good did that do me

his mother died um the week after we got married she had diabetes um uh juvenile sometimes in society each eleven and just over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and and make it through the surgery my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (9234/ 9621) 
you know i certainly would not and what i expect my mom to stay with with that in that kind of a situation you know way i would want her to be happy and i would want my dad to be happy also so ultimately for that situation i think it was much better um they got married kind of young too you know and i think that i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more careful i know that that now it is a lot different than it used to be people would get married and they would just be expected to stay together and there is a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they are miserable 

Recording: (9235/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9236/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (9237/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9238/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9239/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9240/ 9621)

is in the same way here 

Recording: (9244/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9245/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9246/ 9621)

some different types of of courses and those types of things 

Recording: (9249/ 9621) 
one of the bathrooms right now is the jacuzzi um that is not really too hard but the hardest thing to do is electrical work i think it is just because it is more intimidating 

Recording: (9250/ 9621) 
or then they had to after that they had to lottery number and that was not but they were you know if you got your number was picked i mean i do not know what should be worse knowing that you are going to get a nose and being able to prepare for it or uh because i have had friends that gotten uh numbers and everything you know and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my gosh so 

Recording: (9251/ 9621) 
right right but during the rest of the year a lot of times we will play really really uh challenging and interesting band music and you do not always get the opportunity to do that in in uh musical groups yeah sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator what they expect the audience to want to hear 

Recording: (9252/ 9621) 
you know because i just think it looks so awful when you can not you can not even admit to what you what your opinion is 

Recording: (9253/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9254/ 9621) 
clumbus it seems to be i mean it is just like whoa 

Recording: (9255/ 9621) 
yeah and uh she is adorable 

Recording: (9256/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9257/ 9621) 
yeah i hear about suicide rates and they do not get in 

Recording: (9258/ 9621) 
me too 

Recording: (9259/ 9621) 
well i heard housing was tied out there but that is crazy 

Recording: (9260/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9261/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9262/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9263/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9264/ 9621) 
but people coming from other cities like chicago new york you know and places like that where they were treated poorly by whites you know they um they tended to act differently towards you and everything until they realized that you were not liked at it you know uh we only had one reason why i was in the service uh where it was we were predominantly weight uh platoon and uh because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so uh then the security cops were up uh above us and they were predominantly black you know and i do not know what happened to something happened one time there was only like twenty people and our whole uh platoon and everything was in the same barrels and uh some guy said something off color to one of them or something like that you know and it uh it got kind of out of hand for a while but you know saying god nothing really happened 

Recording: (9265/ 9621) 
for fun we have been playing a lot of pool 

Recording: (9266/ 9621) 
yeah they do not pay you for any of that stuff 

Recording: (9267/ 9621) 
right wow 

Recording: (9268/ 9621) 
that was too young 

Recording: (9269/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9270/ 9621) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and them reacted like there is this girl that just got in there today and and her parents are like flipping out because she is pregnant and um we were telling we were all telling her about how you know um it if always starts out that way and they will ease up later on 

Recording: (9271/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9272/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9273/ 9621) 
i know 

Recording: (9274/ 9621) 
at that time and they uh thirty is 

Recording: (9275/ 9621) 
do you want this doing or be this this and that some people will some people some people will say that i feel sorry for those people i pray for those people because prayer is the most powerful thing you can have it is going to get you through nothing else okay what kind of challenge you are having from you you put in his hands and you have enough faith to practice it and it may not come through the practice it he will come through it may not come through it was the way you think it is you want to do but somewhere along the line you are going to say ah for some reason i am supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are always looking for reasons you are asking me i am looking for reasons but a lot of times you can not give a reason it just happens why did you marry your husband why did you how would you meet your husband how would you come about how would you pass him into to explain that to your all spring some day 

Recording: (9276/ 9621) 
to help him 

Recording: (9277/ 9621) 
those are as i think you were implying those are needs to those people but they are not uh so how would we correct some of this you have got to i think we have got to cut out a lot of this luxury we have got to slowly bring quote that family back home uh and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares and today is work uh we are far less agricultural uh we are for more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation uh so uh a man and uh uh or what my main three phrase a woman can do most of the work as being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as agricultural people uh and once again though that would bring people back to this central family up just has to be communications communications as it is going uh it is ireversable uh i i think it can be redoneed and much in the matter she is speaking uh and and where does this start i think it has to start back here in in first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to uh with this common uh you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participate with participate and or assist uh today they have these assistants but they are hired directed assistants they are not in their portraying or passing their their values of the community to the students uh so i think that is i i guess i i will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be come back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis 

Recording: (9278/ 9621) 
because they are they are they are saying you are still a kid but yet 

Recording: (9279/ 9621) 
okay 

Recording: (9280/ 9621) 
but maybe if it if it would have stayed small maybe maybe i could notice some kind of difference that way but but i never i have not noticed anything 

Recording: (9281/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9282/ 9621) 
i i like to watch football i like ohio i have never really gone into anything else but now he is like he likes uh denver and so i will watch that with him but i do not really know much about it so 

Recording: (9283/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9284/ 9621) 
that is weird 

Recording: (9285/ 9621) 
i do i think they you know if you are open with your kids nowadays you have to be with everything that is in the world and my parents never talk to me about drugs or anything 

Recording: (9286/ 9621) 
yeah probably will yeah 

Recording: (9287/ 9621) 
uh-huh and i remember when i was married my uh back said do you want to go uh shopping what 

Recording: (9288/ 9621) 
no i thought my son 

Recording: (9289/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9290/ 9621) 
um you just i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say you know we we want to give you this option we very prefer you do not do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 

Recording: (9291/ 9621) 
yeah

Recording: (9303/ 9621) 
she there is our wonder left right there she travels all the time 

Recording: (9304/ 9621) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9305/ 9621) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (9306/ 9621) 
especially with kids it is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (9307/ 9621) 
really well i just because it is close to japan 

Recording: (9308/ 9621) 
i was more comfortable here than in high schooldo not see like the big click like the popular abracramby wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together it is a big mix of people and everyone is doing their own thing 

Recording: (9309/ 9621) 
well i am very much in favor of guns control very strong gun control uh uh i i it they just seem to be too available uh i have done some of the things that the schools are doing about it you know the kid that comes to school with a paper gun gets suspended that is a little much but 

Recording: (9310/ 9621) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a down side and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really do need it and but you know as long as they have you know created a system whereby you know it will not be obviously as good for those people as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployed but you know i think depending on how um sort of focused they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it is divided up i do not know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in whichever direction they are most suited for you know as far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you would think that you can you know there is something you know hopefully that i do not know 

Recording: (9311/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9312/ 9621)

Recording: (9322/ 9621)

Recording: (9339/ 9621) 
i have not i know i did that they had so many beaches i mean i know that i had a good reputation you know for for like just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back from a country that oh yeah place is terrible you know weather was bad you know that that people were people were rude and everybody is are there just said oh you got to go you got to go you know it is a long five that is well what the time 

Recording: (9340/ 9621) 
where 

Recording: (9341/ 9621) 
whatever you know and uh you know he is pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because uh i was right 

Recording: (9342/ 9621) 
my answer to your question is has this eroded i am going to answer with the word using the word respect uh yes i feel that uh this has eroded over time uh there is not the respect for our elders i do not necessarily mean elders in terms of the uh crime logical age but i am talking in terms of generations the uh there is less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents uh i would almost give you a first hand example uh i just had a uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty uh she will come over to my house grandpa is house and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair uh and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it uh i do not ever tell her uh to to do things and i have pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa or greatgrandfather uh if the if we sold weeds out in the garden we went out and we hold the garden if we if the chicken house needed to be cleaned uh and they had not gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned the chicken house we would say grandpa is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken out well of course you knew very well it was going to be okay but a matter of respect though you asked is it okay for us to do it and uh now with her uh i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are left there for from breakfast and maybe at lunch and uh she she will walk out there i do not say well grandpa how come you did this you are not done and then she may then go ahead and say well now sometimes she will ask us something like that but let us assume she did she asked is it all right if i have some of this she goes ahead and gets the dishes out and she puts them right in there and i think uh with those other dishes makes no effort for her to clean them and and i i i have seen this in many many many incidents but i am living through this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today so yes in my opinion definitely it is eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question uh from over the time that that this kind of thing is eroding and based upon the word respectsoumhumuhhuh uh-huh uh but i mean i never did uh and i just well i will not give you any sense but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try them that is where think of what that was and i know that uh i would try very very hard i got twelve months on it or watch a little more of her if she do not know any of those girlsuhhuhyeah i do i would apologize to my mom he was bad and all i did that i got to put an mouth on kind of thing well well no no i mean now i have only started finding funny about the tv but i have seen a pie and i will fish this pie out of a pieohuhhuhi was sitting there for a while i got out i think my husband was talking about it well instead of that we are i guess that the long distance over or other that uh-huh yes yesshe she does not room up she with the uhyeah yeahyeahuhhuh uhhuhshe just used a word penalty uh penalty has a lots of different definition each individual has uh mental picture what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences uh i want to take just an you say penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left let us come back to about the middle i am concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely and i feel it is absolutely essential that we have penalties we have for everyone for everyone really across the board uh we we are getting away from panel who we are getting away from panels uh there is so many people i just to give an example uh talking about adults i just read uh a statistic the other day right here city of columbus where uh was in the extremely high percent i can not quote the percentages of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequence they are in they are going through red lights and there are many many accidents taking place uh i and it we it used to be that you could place the uh an law enforcement officer at the corner if it happened and you they would uh penalize you by giving your ticket and you faced the court as if a case may be well now we have passed so many little orders and laws and changed the enforcement policies and this kinds of thing where the poor police officer he can not even do that any longer he is got it is somebody it runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody and then be accused for going through the red light he can not justalb either be there because that is called oh i think the word harassment plays a part you are harassment that individual because you were standing there waiting for him to commit this problem well now let us just get what are we from that example you can talk about whether you you were carrying uh well i do not want to get into the guns and knives and stuff in the school with enough 

Recording: (9343/ 9621) 
yeah well i think a lot of times you know people are not real rational as far as as who they they go for 

Recording: (9344/ 9621) 
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent in exchange for having me all the way myself 

Recording: (9345/ 9621) 
not at all 

Recording: (9346/ 9621) 
their ideas i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 

Recording: (9347/ 9621) 
i think because of the movies and i think of nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does spark things in little children is minds and even you know like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that you know and there is just so much violence in when we were growing up there was not any violence on tv we were allowed to watch it but you know i mean i mean the comics were not violent um now which is too open for kids the parents you know they say the parents and monitor them 

Recording: (9348/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9349/ 9621) 
and um from downstairs we broke into my computer 

Recording: (9350/ 9621) 
they just i am not sure really what they do 

Recording: (9351/ 9621) 
i do not know 

Recording: (9352/ 9621) 
yeah my kids were both two two weeks late so i know how that is 

Recording: (9353/ 9621) 
um 

Recording: (9354/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9355/ 9621) 
it is kind of a neat place is not it 

Recording: (9356/ 9621) 
i guess so i hope that they can keep the schools somehow for kids and but it will not be him running it 

Recording: (9357/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9358/ 9621) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (9359/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9360/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9361/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9362/ 9621) 
somebody must have been watching over me 

Recording: (9363/ 9621) 
anybody sees that 

Recording: (9364/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (9365/ 9621) 
there is a lot of uh i do not know how how the training is done with some of these animals and you know some of them are treated very cruelly 

Recording: (9366/ 9621) 
i have not seen any fights i have not seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the land but the only thing that i was really shocked about was the people begging on high street 

Recording: (9367/ 9621) 
no uh it was just the usual things and she touched my things you know because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and you know so that an interestumshe is breathing on me in the car he is i mean too loud i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have i mean you have been through it all yeah there were five of us and a lot of that 

Recording: (9368/ 9621) 
but you know what i mean well he was about nine years old but he is known me all my life so you know what i mean it was not no big shock 

Recording: (9369/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9370/ 9621) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game and then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora you know a hat he looks so cool you know because he will be turned out he always wears a tie i do not know he just he he is a great coach 

Recording: (9371/ 9621) 
yeah um and this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working as a freelance for today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (9372/ 9621) 
oh really 

Recording: (9373/ 9621) 
yeah it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9374/ 9621) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (9375/ 9621) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9376/ 9621) 
you know we will go places you know 

Recording: (9377/ 9621) 
i am not that old yet i might look at 

Recording: (9378/ 9621) 
they do not have babies 

Recording: (9379/ 9621) 
yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to hear to find that that columbus is in so out of shape um but i am in the uh well you know in the circles that i move in uh everybody is for middleaged and they all quit smoking in there all all of a sudden trying to beat off the reper and um uh so you know mean well and of course they were always hippies and eight sprows and a twigs and leaves anyway you know so that you know that is the sort of circles i move in but i know because i have these parttime jobs from time to time i see a whole different group of people and i can say it is probably true 

Recording: (9380/ 9621) 
huhuh 

Recording: (9381/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9382/ 9621) 
just 

Recording: (9383/ 9621) 
so once you convince people there is nothing to be scared of here there is nothing to be scared of there nothing then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (9384/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9385/ 9621) 
and and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9386/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9387/ 9621) 
we did not know you know anything about what he did or we found out more um after he died 

Recording: (9388/ 9621) 
yeah and 

Recording: (9389/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9390/ 9621) 
yeah yeah that is another thing i hear about that 

Recording: (9391/ 9621) 
you know they never asked for extra money and uh they had to cut back on everything and it i think it just set people back now were trying real hard to catch up and at some point were going to uh you know have to put a levy on again and and uh who knows what is happened we are keeping rose a smith right now because she is so good pr with the with the business community but the business community in columbus does not really support the schools and they do not i mean we have got two new uh stadiums and we have not got any increase in school for 

Recording: (9392/ 9621) 
yeah but my oldest she is the oldest um she is got three kids one her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her because they she never sees them um and then they got two other girls and they live together they got a house you know they are on they are going through marriage they have been together for like five years and they are not going they are not doing very well right now but hopefully you know they will get over that and then i got a older brother who um him and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby 

Recording: (9393/ 9621) 
so they i have always used insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they wanted to admit me they told me they were going to make me wait two months before they did anything and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital and i crawled out of the car and crawled in it a hospital until the either met me or i would crawl out the door 

Recording: (9394/ 9621) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and uh close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just as exciting it is still just as good yeah he i am one that all this will not last forever but you know and he is like well when we are nine do you you know you will know so 

Recording: (9395/ 9621) 
so uh he finally decided uh you know after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway you know 

Recording: (9396/ 9621) 
why i mean it is part of the script that you say you believe in a hundred percent and why do not you why do not you talk about it and the problem is that they do not they do not know the answer and if they do not know the answer if they can not give a firm this is the answer then they avoid it i try and find i try and find for me what has become the best answer you know if i do not if i do not if i do not believe something or i do not know what to believe about something i will go and i will find an answer for myself i am not going to take somebody else is answer and if i do take someone else is answer they would better be able to back it up you know yeah yeah yeah yeahyeah yeahbut i know a lot of people that do not uh-huh uhhuhum do younot out i mean i go to the vineyard church it is up in it is up in uh um west braun and there is about there is about probably six thousand of us it is one of the biggest churches in ohio and um if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything it is just a matter of finding it and within any within any denomination or within any religion you go as deep as you want to go you know there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people just go on easter there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday and sunday nights and saturday nights and are very very very into that and i mean i am not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type but i am pretty involved i am pretty involvedumhum the community the community um the church is designed as a community of other christians it is not necessarily designed as um uh i heard this in a service that is really good um it is not designed as a congress comes in and says wait to go past your u go do it we are going to cheer you on the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ that is the job of a christian and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what the original you know that is what the that is what christian is supposed to do and that is what our church does 

Recording: (9397/ 9621) 
wow 

Recording: (9398/ 9621) 
and that is actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back you know and moving all my stuff out of storage i have just been on this you know i am getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it is you know it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded down especially when i have spent so much time just living out of a suitcase you know i just really realize i have so much stuff that i do not need because there you know everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes you know there is not stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive but it is like you know picture frames or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know they are five dollars apiece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (9399/ 9621) 
and that is what i am saying a tone and for sin it is quite a hypocracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in gainesville where i went and buried my grandparents and went to all my life over the door the church is a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary appraised and all this men with his sore drawn a dead native american and his feet and three more at the side looking on and fair now i asked the priest cold hard question 

Recording: (9400/ 9621) 
i get whit that is it 

Recording: (9401/ 9621) 
so uh i had some family responsibilities we were always my brother and i and my sisters were active in the four h club 

Recording: (9402/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9403/ 9621) 
that is awesome there is there is lots of stuff to do down there if you like outdoors i bet 

Recording: (9404/ 9621) 
yes 

Recording: (9405/ 9621) 
the university never has money that is like me when i first came here the university was not paying me nothing i were two year or two jobs for ten years while i was here at the first ten years just to make a living 

Recording: (9406/ 9621) 
and he did that too uh 

Recording: (9407/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9408/ 9621) 
simply because it is not too much of a change from the status quo 

Recording: (9409/ 9621) 
um and like even the people the maybe their apartments did not look as impressive but they were making money 

Recording: (9410/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9411/ 9621) 
things you know collecting but it is hard with my sister is cats because she has a little girl and no she does not go home back every day you know but um 

Recording: (9412/ 9621) 
in the 

Recording: (9413/ 9621) 
yeah and i think it could work but i do not think people are ready to accept it and if the people finally giving the information are not ready to accept it then 

Recording: (9414/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9415/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9416/ 9621) 
well you are in a high texas idea most people you said you are from new york right your family is where 

Recording: (9417/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9418/ 9621) 
i mean i 

Recording: (9419/ 9621) 
i think so 

Recording: (9420/ 9621) 
well they only keep them there like for you know a day or so and then they um try to intervene with their family put them back with their family or um maybe call in children services and i and i just really do not think much children services so 

Recording: (9421/ 9621) 
yeah i do not know where they are going now but 

Recording: (9422/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9423/ 9621) 
see it marl i mean hold them feel the warm of the body uh hear the conversation quietly rather than uh hearing okay time to get out of here you know with a bigger rust saying but it was a pleasant sort of remark these kind i can be elaborate i can write a whole book on that on this on the entry of your quiteters uh but it is these kinds of things are very elementary really they are very elementary i guess to our age group but maybe not so sure maybe the baby boomers that would not be elementary at all at going back to your question about the baby boomers i still think they were i do not think they are causing about that i think it was a happened to stay in with that group with a massive group very 

Recording: (9424/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (9425/ 9621) 
oh i think that is good 

Recording: (9426/ 9621) 
i can see that uh you know like i said for me i kind of i kind of stay where i am so it is not that i really travel out into some of those other areas more so i mean it does not really affect me personally i mean that is bad i do not know maybe that is still guilty about that but 

Recording: (9427/ 9621) 
that is all i understand is money 

Recording: (9428/ 9621) 
my thesis is on the suitate in germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia uh before the second world war and uh specifically i am looking at how they perceive to their condition switching from being part of the australian empire uh and the germans being sort of the the majority uh even though they were not the majority but sort of the the uh the master nation within the eastern hungarian empire to becoming uh a minority within czechoslovia 

Recording: (9429/ 9621) 
there is very definitely 

Recording: (9430/ 9621) 
yeah they he is burning couches and uh over by perot alley they are actually rolling a volkswagen down the alley and there is all kinds of people doing it 

Recording: (9431/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9432/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9433/ 9621) 
uh north end of the river side hospital 

Recording: (9434/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9435/ 9621) 
right well why do you have to do anything with it 

Recording: (9436/ 9621) 
and that is really old and i am just ridiculously like seventies it is ridiculous and he is giving them out but the only thing is if you take one you have to finish you have to um install a disk drive 

Recording: (9437/ 9621) 
my mom teaches there so it is free tuition i get a tuition waive her 

Recording: (9438/ 9621) 
you know that is a possibility you do not you are you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you because you know the the word has to get out that we do not have that much money it does not pay yeah 

Recording: (9439/ 9621) 
you know always something going on 

Recording: (9440/ 9621) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet uh you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and call and you know things that we you know when i was growing up we just there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was into you know lafay and tom and jerry i mean you know these but you know they were not violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i just think i do not think it could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (9441/ 9621) 
no the lifestyle was you know very easy to fit into and i have always been you know interested in you know sort of liked to the whole european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and you know studying english here as as i am in those in in studying english in or in england is you know sort of i do not know more sort of elitist which i did not realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and it there were a few classes that released it out where you know there was sort of you know you i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh you know what what does this american know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes i mean not directly they would never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of 

Recording: (9442/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9443/ 9621) 
so they got more by by him power if they got there okay 

Recording: (9444/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9445/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (9446/ 9621) 
and it was threatening kids with it and so they suspended him 

Recording: (9447/ 9621) 
yeah i mean 

Recording: (9448/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9449/ 9621) 
he does and he is he he his music is extremely good he um himself he buy you know sixteen he is playing eight instruments very well uh he just and he can not do that now where he lives now he lives with this and another thing in my was my mind his uh girlfriend is mother she is he is afraid her girlfriend his girlfriend that her daughter was going to run away so she let them sleep together in their house when she her daughter was fourteen 

Recording: (9450/ 9621) 
and he was one just for one minute my mother taught me that um i do not stay i do not stay in him in the corner 

Recording: (9451/ 9621) 
that is huge 

Recording: (9452/ 9621) 
really 

Recording: (9453/ 9621) 
but i want them to do that to me i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a lot of place a lot better place and along with the politicians they stopped saying now what is really best for the general public and that what we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (9454/ 9621) 
there is lots of of uh theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants 

Recording: (9455/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9456/ 9621) 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you yeah 

Recording: (9457/ 9621) 
i am retired 

Recording: (9458/ 9621) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like the traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an operation type thing like like it is more of like uh it is not like an mtv type thing you know 

Recording: (9459/ 9621) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (9460/ 9621) 
she is she is wonderful but you but back then they were they were the sixties and they were hippies and you know my mom is got long black hair and they are wearing their army outfits and their whatever you know everybody is got bell bombs and my dad is got like here down here and everything so they lived like seventeen thousand you for a while and we lived um like i said on summer until i was about three years old and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was which was which great for me i mean everybody my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom and i would do fun stuff and it and and i do not i never remember it being negative 

Recording: (9461/ 9621) 
um i definitely i mean i have think i went to like kindergarten in a public school so i do not really know too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do but i know i mean as far as going to a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that that i am doing now stuff already covered in high school so already have a basis for it 

Recording: (9462/ 9621) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i know it is like i mean it is the same proportion i mean there are more old people there but it just seems more apparent just because of how but you can not like go outside all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (9463/ 9621) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look how i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (9464/ 9621) 
i think the news media have hypered up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba this says anyone that is trying to escape from cuba united states that is found at sea is immediately returned to cuba whether you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is that is the premise operating on uh you know in the news media they have not really been uh they just have not been real objective about it i mean uh you know like there are two fisherman that found him and cia you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just briefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should get back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay in miami the other one thinks he should get back with his father you do not hear about him as reading about a newsweek or someplace uh so i think the news media is not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (9465/ 9621) 
uh you know stuff like that it is like it is kind of neat because you do not have to pay well you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (9466/ 9621) 
but we still need to have property management records that is very essential and a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it uh they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it is been uh installed or removed relocated where it might be but we need to know that how it has an impact upon the design of a particular uh facility voice and data 

Recording: (9467/ 9621) 
yeah i mean like it just it provides an a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 

Recording: (9468/ 9621) 
three years i have um usually i have them six seventh and eighth for those language art subjects unless they get some miracleous cure and they get phased out like right now i am phasing the an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still a terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he is supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspelled something you can figure out what it says from the context you know so we are in the process of phasing him out so that he will not have to he is had help i think since he was in kindergarten that is the other thing that is really in the stigma about these kids ninety percent of the time they are i cruise like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean they are very bright but yet something is not 

Recording: (9469/ 9621) 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know it was kind of appalling to the to the parents and everything i guess maybe this where i am coming from i mean uh the way some of the uh case dress you know a retel back to and with the bell bottoms and everything to us and they uh the pier things i just can not get into that you know and and some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my god they are that fourteen to six fifteen years older they look like they are twenty some years old you know and that is what they want to look like plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv and you sit there and go uh i can my my daughter do not do that you know which is around me no uh which is away from me i do not know what else she does 

Recording: (9470/ 9621) 
he was only fifty six 

Recording: (9471/ 9621) 
huh 

Recording: (9472/ 9621) 
because i have become in popular if i have like any time away from my girlfriend 

Recording: (9473/ 9621) 
there is uh you know just uh it was i had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that that there was it was no accident it was supposed to happen and uh there is a word called sink christity 

Recording: (9474/ 9621) 
well and and especially in my situation you know that uh i think about it quite a bit you know if i were to had uh more of an opportunity to have a oneonone uh relationship with her i would probably uh uh being a girl you know could have probably helped her out in uh in a lot of social social things you know about yeah because i i kind of get the impression that she is you know really she still is not very interested in men you know so which is the first thing you know so 

Recording: (9475/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9476/ 9621) 
just you know just let people make their own mistakes and then but do not make me pay for it yeah 

Recording: (9477/ 9621) 
like like what is the other if you had time and money and you would you would be able to you know do the do the terrorist things 

Recording: (9478/ 9621) 
oh yeah i was never going to get married again i had my house with kids you know i had already done that i was financially secure and i did not i was not even looking one of my best friends though at the time uh she saw this guy she he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing and i talked to this girl every day and she was like oh you have to meet him you have to meet him well it was like oh you know call me tomorrow i do not want to meet anybody so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were she was right i mean and we were like newborn from probably oh two weeks after we met we just i have not been without him so

yeah 

Recording: (9480/ 9621) 
yeah he is got energy yeah 

Recording: (9481/ 9621) 
exactly right yeah yeah and you know a lot of people i work with do not see that and you know they think i am a real cheapskate you know because you know i well i spend money you know and well i i am very selective i mean like uh i would love to go to disney world and there are people work that would not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in you know now i drive there i do not fly because i am really that cheap but you know i love to fly but i just go oh my gosh and you know but you know i will do that but you know like um like at uh thanksgiving time we do not buy a butter ball turkey we buy amire and it is like it is just as good you know and you know we make do you know

yeah well we did not we did not find out we had a um i do not know we figured we just wait and be surprised is that what you guys did 

Recording: (9485/ 9621) 
i think so i mean there is enough open minded people in the country 

Recording: (9486/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9487/ 9621) 
they are but it seems like they are going out yeah instead of having we do not do things in hotels and things because they have inhouse

Recording: (9494/ 9621) 
i just have not enjoyed it right yeah before that i was fine if i if i i made a mistake by playing for that one job i just wanted to get something different because i did not want to go back where i was why i would have been better off back where i was i would have been better at the job for one thing and i knew knew kind of insanity i would be dealing with there 

Recording: (9495/ 9621) 
that is fine 

Recording: (9496/ 9621) 
i do not get on it but i mean it is there 

Recording: (9497/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9498/ 9621) 
uh one of my friends who had the apartment in arlington

Recording: (9503/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9504/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9505/ 9621) 
which they have to 

Recording: (9506/ 9621) 
if they had a way to cure it then fine but leave that up to the people 

Recording: (9507/ 9621) 
i tried falling volunteering you know picking them up doing a volunteer thing and i would get calls all during the night to go pick these kids up because i thought it was doing something to help but you know you know not helping them 

Recording: (9508/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9509/ 9621) 
i wanted i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up picking up that child and coddling it and and having having that baby touch your skin uh and uh uh teaching uh what love is uh uh you do not necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother or the little brother and the little sister all of those now you say teach that well my god did not they know that when they first came into this classroom no not today not today i i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i am not being laboratory uh students in high school today probably have not had their mother or their father truly hold them and hug them rather than just saying hi johnny bye 

Recording: (9510/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (9511/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9512/ 9621) 
you are talking to people all over the country i mean you are becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world 

Recording: (9513/ 9621) 
the lawyers the judges everybody that works in that system i do not care who they are there is not an honest one in it i do not care there is not an honest one they might think they are but once you expose yourself to corruption you take that in with you 

Recording: (9514/ 9621) 
right 

Recording: (9515/ 9621) 
so i just with that terrible thing that happens in montana and 

Recording: (9516/ 9621) 
yeah they started in two thousand three 

Recording: (9517/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9518/ 9621) 
oh 

Recording: (9519/ 9621) 
i mean i i mean that probably can be proven i do not know if anybody would do any decent studies on it i would just bet you a million dollars that you know it would that is what is a tv you know the and then and another thing that well tv is in uh where it comes from but like the kids are all into book them on right now 

Recording: (9520/ 9621) 
yeah i have been everybody pretty much around where we used to live just you know it gets worse and worse 

Recording: (9521/ 9621) 
you know go in there and find out you know if the kid is being abused if the kid is being abused you know take them out you know forget the parents rights you know or um you know you know if they are using drugs put them somewhere you know and get them you know get them and rehab you know and keep them there you know just do not throw them there for three days and then throw them out it is a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing is getting accomplished 

Recording: (9522/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9523/ 9621) 
does not bother me at all 

Recording: (9524/ 9621) 
um going to be interested for myself i need something to sell and selling my own time does not actually seem to be worthwhile and ever i have done it i have already done independent consulting uh where in i signed up the contract and said hi you are paying me i will do this thing and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that probably as you get taxed up something like that because you are having an employer paying off your taxes for you and um there is other bunches of overhead involved and there is the cost it is like of marketing on self and it all depends on how much you want to market yourself marketing yourself is easier for some people than for others and it is more fun for some people than for others so so far i do not know if i 

Recording: (9525/ 9621) 
that whole thing 

Recording: (9526/ 9621) 
yeah i guess they do i do not know what where where it is or how many they have 

Recording: (9527/ 9621) 
i think it is too late i do i 

Recording: (9528/ 9621) 
and call her tammy when she is little 

Recording: (9529/ 9621) 
back there black so it is right near like a lot of other student housing 

Recording: (9530/ 9621) 
no they always have a way to get you out of the car and you know like they will order a pizza for some place that is dark they will be waiting there yeah yeah so that is yeah 

Recording: (9531/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9532/ 9621) 
yep 

Recording: (9533/ 9621) 
oh no no i do not feel that at all in the you know we do not have to take or to get together with other friends and take our kids places i do not remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or you know i do not remember things like that and uh it could have been there maybe but 

Recording: (9534/ 9621) 
right that is good 

Recording: (9535/ 9621) 
uh 

Recording: (9536/ 9621) 
i am gonna let him choose i really am i think as long i mean i really do not care what religion he is i mean with my husband i really did not care if he turned catholic or not i do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people i think that is important if he wants to be catholic great if he does not that is okay too 

Recording: (9537/ 9621) 
but i mean that is just sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they obviously they are gonna get into stuff and things like that and i mean it is not always the parents fault i mean i there are a lot of people i mean i think just in the news a few weeks ago they had a shooting that happened a couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it and the parent like left it in the top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and ended up shooting himself with it i mean as far as that because i mean there is really nothing more he can do i mean 

Recording: (9538/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9539/ 9621) 
oh projects were right for emphasis where i was designing the projects first of all we had to find out what we had with the best year and as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house the telephone company does not provide the service to you anymore well we had know what we had throughout the state of ohio and some eighty eight counties and uh wherever else the facilities we had and so we went on a scupper hunt 

Recording: (9540/ 9621) 
the lack of discipline at the home 

Recording: (9541/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9542/ 9621) 
right well that is something i have noticed in the local news particularly later they say exclusively on our channel and stuff and it is usually not that big of a deal what they are talking about but they are making a big point that you heard it here first and i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station another what difference is it make 

Recording: (9543/ 9621) 
um but yeah i do not know yeah i think it is like there is like a real like either it is it is old people or their retiring or whatever and where it is uh more of like a younger people there i do not know you do not see a lot i do not know there is middle age people there but it is not so apparent like it is here i guess 

Recording: (9544/ 9621) 
um it i mean it was a pretty good place i mean looking back on it i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there 

Recording: (9545/ 9621) 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had absolutely they would lock you in the closet throw at a key and we let you out most of the parents i have seen uh to me i would rather see the kids with a stepparent 

Recording: (9546/ 9621) 
i worked for a company called high lights for children 

Recording: (9547/ 9621) 
uh it is 

Recording: (9548/ 9621) 
yeah no no oh man i 

Recording: (9549/ 9621) 
both uh to one uh 

Recording: (9550/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9551/ 9621) 
they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one death and they were giving him three deaths 

Recording: (9552/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9553/ 9621) 
right right 

Recording: (9554/ 9621) 
yeah my aunts do 

Recording: (9555/ 9621) 
i have no idea 

Recording: (9556/ 9621) 
right well 

Recording: (9557/ 9621) 
right and and you are not as close to your family and the traditions and the and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up and worked and moving that i do not think kids have the center based of the family that they used to have and i do not know the the culture is just so fast paced that i do not think people are maybe it is not honesty maybe it is just they do not have as much time to get attached and they are ready to move on again you just do not get as close to the people as you used to 

Recording: (9558/ 9621) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so 

Recording: (9559/ 9621) 
helped them yeah 

Recording: (9560/ 9621) 
that is just ridiculous too but yeah to me that is really weird i do not like i said i do not know what they are what they are thinking it or what their thought process was but i am thinking maybe it is just social because a lot to me our high school is real social 

Recording: (9561/ 9621) 
well that gets back to what you are saying almost in the family life hey what is a you do not need a husband all you need is a burn bank that is what you are saying are not you are not you 

Recording: (9562/ 9621) 
well um that i do not know how to explain that especially if anybody is gonna listen to this um i had a friend that taught classes human potential classes was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement so um a a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett uh who really is the father of the human potential movement moved out there and he was going to have a group of people work out there and uh and he said that you know i was qualified well when we got out there just fell through you know and we all just lived our lives but i was glad that you know that he got me out there because i adore it i i just loved it out there 

Recording: (9563/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9564/ 9621) 
i think um-hum 

Recording: (9565/ 9621) 
i think in the case of tie it should be used but you know like if there is a black woman who is very well qualified for a job and a white male is equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it 

Recording: (9566/ 9621) 
they uh 

Recording: (9567/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9568/ 9621) 
and and the data they collect is just i mean well i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but the basics data is essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself but 

Recording: (9569/ 9621) 
right right tremendous demand right now 

Recording: (9570/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9571/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9572/ 9621) 
he is from ohio and 

Recording: (9573/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9574/ 9621) 
it is up to him to resolve it 

Recording: (9575/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9576/ 9621) 
try and feed eight children and if you are here in this country and eight children why do you have eight children to start with 

Recording: (9577/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9578/ 9621) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (9579/ 9621) 
exactly 

Recording: (9580/ 9621) 
and then they physically died before they got a chance to live and while their spirit wakes up and finds out that they are physically dead and they can not do anything in a physical world anymore they want to draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person they want to draw them to the brightest thing 

Recording: (9581/ 9621) 
they think that you get paid and i have not made the first number yet that if you live in this house you could trip it your share you clean up your room you help with the dishes you take your plates in the table once and a while i am putting it there by the thing you take turns doing the dishes if if mom or somebody is busy and can not do it you help and you do your share around the home and you do not do it because you are going to get paid for it well that it gets paid well yeah but daddy is the one that is supporting the household you know has got to pay for the all the utilities and the uh the finances and the food we bring and everything else but everybody else is got to help here to make the home and i think that that is one of the problem too many people think instead of just getting them to lovely andly help each other because we are supposed to help each other and this goes all right back to way it said you said beginning in school or kindergarten i think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a ball and rock it and sing to it put it to bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up teach them how to tie their shoes and take them off teach them how to do whatever thing they are supposed to do and oh that reminds me of a joke i got to tell this and maybe this is off the record but i read it in reader is digest the other day and they said about this uh little uh the mother was trying to teach a child how to put the clothes away she would go put it in the hamper and the kid looked at her like as criss hamper hamper well you know where uh where daddy and mom never before our clothes when we when we take them off and the kid immediately took clothes when not to not need to on down beside daddy is bed 

Recording: (9582/ 9621) 
yeah he just used that rainex stuff 

Recording: (9583/ 9621) 
um-hum 

Recording: (9584/ 9621) 
yeah 

Recording: (9585/ 9621)
