right but the ones that raicing are the ones that are the standards in the fields but right and but more and more of those are also available on the web but you have to subscribe to them so it is still an institutional subscription i mean that is a constant problem for the serials people everywhere i an it just it is incredible what is happened with the costss you know i mean i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year 

Recording: (9/ 9618)

Recording: (11/ 9618) 
yeah and it makes it you know fun so you can actually see what you know youare studying these teams does you know you can go a whole season you knowit seventeen eighteen no and nobody is pretty much coming close to your standard and when you win all that money it is just like yeah when you lose all the money it is like that is it  i am going home  but i have knong people o gamble you know compulsively i mean it is like a gambler is anonimous level i could not really get into that number one i am not the richest person in the world and number two just a little money here is one thing but when your out there spend in your car insurance money one it or rant money then you got a real problem there i have seen guys do that too got down to sider to downs and bet the bet the farm on one hourse and would not even do anything for them 

Recording: (12/ 9618) 
i have learned a lot about cooking lately 

Recording: (13/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (14/ 9618) 
so just trying to take my time do what i want to do yeah 

Recording: (15/ 9618) 
i am a senior and i just started the my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (16/ 9618) 
it is it is 

Recording: (17/ 9618) 
yeah it is projected like  six years to take to finish some of these projects it is an real well i know wen we drove through georgia you actually see people working on the road there is a whole bunch of people and they are all out there working you know and you get to ohio there is that i do not know something on david david letterman had a picture of this and i think i have seen it before that big sine a says you are tax dollars at work you know and there is the construction guys smoking a cigaret leaning up against the side kind of thing  ke great hit is at kind of funny 

Recording: (18/ 9618) 
it is just the way it is i guess but it is like you know she says if the mother is in the house the mother is on duty 

Recording: (19/ 9618) 
yes 

Recording: (20/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (21/ 9618) 
rig right but at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested and and there was a lot of i have always loved to travel by car yeah it is it is fun and it is probably because of that early conditioning  i have been i have been in forty eight states 

Recording: (22/ 9618) 
no it was his mom ran away is what happened 

Recording: (23/ 9618) 
oh yeah byt 

Recording: (24/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (25/ 9618) 
yeahat is curious is not it 

Recording: (26/ 9618) 
i do not know um like yi said i mean it is something i basically see it almost as being the same thing its like cigaretes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of torand it things like that but as far as what it the effects it doese to you it is no worse than anything alcohol can do to you um so i mean i do not know i mean it i am not sure if they should actually go so far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to control drug problem wise the thingis coming in i mean i know i think it is like switcerland or somewhere like that where they have legalized drugs and they basically do it government based where the government actually gives them out and the government gets the money for it um i could almost see that as being almost a good idea here i mean obviously like  said people are going to do it no matter what i meant same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on it  does not matter what they have to do to it the wih they will come buy it um i mean i i mean i coult see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to a better use of some sorts if they did the same kind of thing 

Recording: (27/ 9618) 
because not only is he a shovin is pig but he is a big get too  arisa is yeah so 

Recording: (28/ 9618) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a formufil out and how much you have if you have taken any depretiation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is the percentage that goes on to your schedule etheat goes in the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (29/ 9618) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (30/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (31/ 9618) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government telling me what to do 

Recording: (32/ 9618) 
and most of them think the freshmen class just ride along i think the freshmeni would be a little bit tougher you know it would be tougher to be walking around know in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million halls around me and just stopped once and i said were is lazamby and they that way i ot too far from where i parked 

Recording: (33/ 9618) 
and that is the way i felt about it not i am not saying that that is not a possbility but 

Recording: (34/ 9618) 
yeah well like the catalog is real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and like the catalog has like a hundred of them so that is relly annoying too because then people call up with all these like things that we like do not know if we have and our computers are really really old like  it is like an old style mainframe 

Recording: (35/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (36/ 9618) 
tell you it is mine now 

Recording: (37/ 9618) 
oh i yeah exactly i was just wondering how could i get a job doing what you are doing 

Recording: (38/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (39/ 9618) 
or take me to court again you know they got the money i do not 

Recording: (40/ 9618)

Recording: (41/ 9618) 
yes she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (42/ 9618) 
o 

Recording: (43/ 9618) 
actually i was not even that sure that i wanted to do it until um like senior year and the opportunity came up bat i said ooh this sounds cool you know i had thought of myself as a uh chemist for a long time and but this opportunity came up yeah i woad applied to like other places and i got any university os chicago and i wanted to go there and then this came up here and also u it is justt ridiculously cheaper here i did not want det after unded thit is just pathetic um my counseler just kind of found it and he wald poasted it and he especially um tried to notify the national marit people about it and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school they all one of them is at princton right now you know they are all off at their ivy leagues like basically working their butts off to get in when i murred youand  i do not totally understand it 

Recording: (44/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (45/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (46/ 9618) 
uh it is all over they contract with dominion homes and dominion is seems like it is going up everywhere nmi so they are all over uh they have projects all over 

Recording: (47/ 9618) 
she just wants to get it overwet 

Recording: (48/ 9618) 
even harder 

Recording: (49/ 9618)

Recording: (51/ 9618) 
i know i o i do not want to go i do not want to touch he computer when i go home 

Recording: (52/ 9618) 
that is true 

Recording: (53/ 9618) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is com it is jost columbus it is jost columbus im maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here um do not realize how it i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not sanfrancisco there is a lot of places thit is not but it is n uh you know it is not a backwater either well they need to get out more  i mean you know all this oh we will never be a major league city until we have major leage sports it is well i you know i guess uh getting out more i would not help those peop it is um uh that that would be tha you know that would be such a small part of oh civilization anywhere for me and um i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i i i really do think people do not take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (54/ 9618) 
really umhum i think it is really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago all these women i know 

Recording: (55/ 9618) 
so she is very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that uh so she is basically disabled and that goes when they do that it is because of your education and also they take in consideration everything 

Recording: (56/ 9618) 
which i think is kind of nice so i mean it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable i mean my biggest thing is i just want to have a room to all myself you know i do not want to go some place whr i wan o have to leak deal with somebody tin so i mean it looks it looks nice but i would be more comfortable at home i think once igo

Recording: (60/ 9618) 
well i often have to write on papers i believe you turned in the wrong paper i believe i got the rough draft ind stead of the final copy do you have the final copy somewhere at home 

Recording: (61/ 9618) 
yeah ella in tat laine avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean i was really lucky to run across her 

Recording: (62/ 9618) 
it does 

Recording: (63/ 9618) 
and he could not have any kind of cafine other ways he would get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills 

Recording: (64/ 9618) 
yeah so that is taking some runding around 

Recording: (65/ 9618) 
um i think some of it was nhat i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any frends ore you feel totally different i mean i stil go throug that i think we all go through that to some point or other even yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody yeither in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind ey i think that is part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrong doing and your child is eyes you need to really admit it um i mean you do not want to do that but 

Recording: (66/ 9618) 
no no i am i am interested 

Recording: (67/ 9618) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in ah setting in school if they had a a man earlyer on rather than having to wait until they are in middle school to relate to a coaach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (68/ 9618) 
mean this one dkota di so 

Recording: (69/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (70/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (71/ 9618) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principalis like yousee hewould saye mis you know i am i am her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mises you know she is like you know the average student uh she is the type you know that she is going to get you know she is u going to get through college you know she is just one of those you know that just moves right along you know she is not the brightest you know but she is bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today and i it was just like well i just want more help for my daughter you know i just went somebody to you know juirk her down 

Recording: (72/ 9618) 
that is great 

Recording: (73/ 9618) 
they had to they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital whell they said to me will you stay while i said yes but then uh uh when it got into two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it is like i am sorry i am a substiute substitute i am getting sixty dollars a day i can not do this anness you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am sorry i mean if i  if it was my own job i would have struggled with it but i was not my own job and i did not know what was going to happen so if they would have gotten some help in there for me i would have stayed perhaps but no i i you know you can work for underpay and understaff and ever you can not do everything so 

Recording: (74/ 9618) 
uh threahtening her and stuff like that and uh wat all i would have to do is get on the phone and sit there and say you know i can to be out there in about two hours you know so i do not know hat your problem is but you need to get eve to talk to me about talk to your mom about it or go see somebody else and talk to them about it 

Recording: (75/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (76/ 9618) 
and decided to go back for their jobs i if you noticed the first time that they voted they voted down this proposal the proposal that they are voting on this week is the exact same one 

Recording: (77/ 9618) 
and i am just using that as a example you know i mean youare other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (78/ 9618) 
they could do it my gran my one granddaughter uh they live in springfield they just moved to springfild and she goes to kindergarten only a half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper watching the news she told me a story aboutchristofher columbus uh discovering america that was so deep and intense i could not believe it was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (79/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (80/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (81/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (82/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (83/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (84/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (85/ 9618) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home uh my dad uh had to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities and uh she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (86/ 9618) 
i think it is probably too though that a lot of people ave are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in collumbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they are from the south or something like that so theynd then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in collumbus so 

Recording: (87/ 9618) 
oh okay that was c 

Recording: (88/ 9618) 
nd he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (89/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (90/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (91/ 9618) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but to hell with all the other laws so is that really fair 

Recording: (92/ 9618) 
that is great 

Recording: (93/ 9618) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (94/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (95/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (96/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (97/ 9618) 
yeh 

Recording: (98/ 9618) 
um he he is a sub contractor and if uh someone is got a job to do i at their house e he will do it you know like we we just went and toored the cabinets out of a a house that was on fire and because of the smoke damage 

Recording: (99/ 9618) 
the hours with because jasan works during the day too so it would probably work out pretty well for us 

Recording: (100/ 9618) 
all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on except the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that 

Recording: (101/ 9618) 
y 

Recording: (102/ 9618) 
boy that is  that is a really tough one i had not had not thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touchy about sexual identity and and so likely you know so insecure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a has a different orientation and i  i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (103/ 9618) 
i went to a um the just about just a little uh east of here high school 

Recording: (104/ 9618) 
he works in a factory 

Recording: (105/ 9618) 
uh all those years after i left at the school here was he te buro of employment services i worked t uh twenty years with uh research and statistics labor market information uh federal state programs collecting information on three different programs and that time d then i worked for ah about a year and a half on a special project uh they were autimating the employment services iactivities and they were going a complete differetwer direction to match job needs of employers and applicants eh to get more placments for interviews and that sort of thing and i developed that method theh the meconisom that checkallists and stuff i worked on that uh and then i worked for the last three years in jobs training uh for economic disadvantage youth adults and dislocated workers 

Recording: (106/ 9618) 
and one of them they d loked at in collumbus was uh how whill he was doing it school well gt children off have the ig one of the highest dropper outrates in schools and they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money tomy my feeling is you know there s a lot of programs in school that sponswered by the federal government particularly uh to help the students are that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (107/ 9618) 
hen they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three undred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars tha will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it

Recording: (110/ 9618) 
ou have a preference at five or six but by the time you turn eight one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it is going to be the one that runs a show well then that is when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture sohum

ht that is the amazing thing about this country is that there is enough space in the united states and north america that you can have all these incredible monstrocity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them h 

Recording: (176/ 9618) 
mhum 

Recording: (177/ 9618)

Recording: (180/ 9618) 
umhum yeah because i could not imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (181/ 9618) 
um i got into painting somewhat recently uh have always done a lot of art uh my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to art as a child uh did pretty good two but i never got in to painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing and just uh you know three or four years ago i thought i am going to learn how to paint and i learned how to paint 

Recording: (182/ 9618)

Recording: (185/ 9618) 
well yeah u under certain 

Recording: (186/ 9618) 
no kno but that bu thatis what am saying  but that is that s wat a m saying an the same thing as happening when we had the busting we took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment oh they they got the taste of it and then went back home ohum and we did an very unjustice thing to those kids and to the families and then when we broke them up we did something else you know tok them our own we lost that community involvement so now the parents can not follow theur kids to their activities  geti them splitting it up ey we do nthemwin n we do not want at families that is a misnumer they said the fam the community raises the family the kids yeah that is how they want you think but the thecommunity will not e replace the family 

Recording: (187/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (188/ 9618) 
yea 

Recording: (189/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (190/ 9618) 
yeah say i hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter 

Recording: (191/ 9618) 
oh and 

Recording: (192/ 9618) 
rit 

Recording: (193/ 9618) 
s the way i feel 

Recording: (194/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (195/ 9618) 
right after high school i think there was probably i will say six and amazingly uh well three were still together 

Recording: (196/ 9618) 
are they but they all look a lot 

Recording: (197/ 9618) 
no no but 

Recording: (198/ 9618) 
geana we just had a van who took time jos 

Recording: (199/ 9618) 
o okay 

Recording: (200/ 9618) 
uuh that is nice yeah i am sure 

Recording: (201/ 9618) 
eh 

Recording: (202/ 9618) 
that is true 

Recording: (203/ 9618) 
uh they uh stopped federally funding uh osu that was the federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people move like to arizona and california and and i thought well since i onlly have like two and a half years util i retire and i really liked collumbus and i thought i do not want to  uproup my daughter is out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port collumbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (204/ 9618) 
so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i would call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that crying spell but he did go ho that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (205/ 9618) 
i try to be as much as possible to i think it is very important that both parents they see both 

Recording: (206/ 9618) 
take this area from southeast london 

Recording: (207/ 9618) 
city council of dagon and had higlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line and should have gone to collumbus at the same timere interesting 

Recording: (208/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (209/ 9618) 
yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready 

Recording: (210/ 9618) 
my dad seems to think i should go unto law because there is law and everything you can do anything with a law degree 

Recording: (211/ 9618) 
well personally i voted that the thirty three should pass i think they should the way i undertood i they have ways of wording those things jhat you have to read it very carefully d ot kno whether you should say yes or no on  thing i said yes because i u uh annalized it tosay that they are repealing something that was passed i think  one or two years ago thate was allowing things to be done up around the polarius area like new roaads and this and that and i want that repealed because i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things 

Recording: (212/ 9618) 
oh my god 

Recording: (213/ 9618) 
eyre justm like it a little less or dislike it a little more when when it it looks like it is going to come to some it looks like they are it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience and  u i that is not something i feel teased by particularly 

Recording: (214/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (215/ 9618) 
kind 

Recording: (216/ 9618) 
ould not even think about asking 

Recording: (217/ 9618) 
yeah i i thought in the beginning i missed mary lake cafe so bad i st have the good subs and all that i do not i do not know why i miss them i do not i go back and ow i just do not like it anymore 

Recording: (218/ 9618) 
yes 

Recording: (219/ 9618) 
whenever he runs well i thought he was going to be ellected uh mayor too but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but um uh you know he is got his constintuats and they are going to reellect him because he stands up for the minority i thinke what he makes a mistake as san labeling things races that are not necessarily races but anyway 

Recording: (220/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (221/ 9618) 
yeah it is just like uh having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicting it could screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors 

Recording: (222/ 9618) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because your black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your haritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same thing with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know you are roots and where you came from i mean i ont can not see it being a problem of any sorts um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (223/ 9618) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation you kn mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his and he said his dad told him about condums you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus what the inornat and everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents still if you are going to be a parent you need to be responsible ind i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (224/ 9618) 
i know 

Recording: (225/ 9618) 
um in general i think i think the united states has i a fairly well developed like not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class 

Recording: (226/ 9618) 
yeah and 

Recording: (227/ 9618) 
lower that is right you have been to astala yeah

Recording: (244/ 9618) 
and then like let us see a lot of it was i mean most of it was was like prelabor and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video it was mostly lakelabor related

Recording: (249/ 9618) 
i i do not think so in new york it might be ima like i say it is a lot more competitive there here i think i think columbus is and the midwest in general i think is much more open 

Recording: (250/ 9618) 
yeah there is uh some people there just get lazy and then you got the college students they i do not know how many of them work but most of them there is just from out of town 

Recording: (251/ 9618) 
no it is just uh regular old rentacop with a zone van he l hop in i will give you a ride and drove me to the corner of the middle of nowhare in acordence to where i live and then i had to walk all the way home 

Recording: (252/ 9618) 
um one of the requirements is we have to be in the ounnerso college during undergraduate and le fulfill all the requirements there 

Recording: (253/ 9618)

Recording: (254/ 9618) 
oh yeah they were more settled 

Recording: (255/ 9618) 
yeah yeah they are pretty good where i live um ll last year when we had that really really high snow um i shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over so it was like what is the boo um but our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk

Recording: (260/ 9618) 
it is funny because i studied russian but a lot of the people i have served with were fluent and spanish or something else sois like i do not know why they got sent there but it is i i mean we have really believe that there that it is inspired they send our your name in a picture and your application to the profit who is the head of the church and um they pray over it and they decide where you go 

Recording: (261/ 9618)

i feel like i should be staynding out there giving  money because my bills are getting behind 

Recording: (287/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (288/ 9618) 
i am not sure i am ready to go back through all of that 

Recording: (289/ 9618) 
absent for the whole day which would be considered truent so they said i what i had to do was go down to juvinile to the certain gentleman in juvinile and have him file charges so i took my son down to him and he said it was ta school should have did that so in the meantime he wis telling me that my son in getting ready to go aleventh grade and neither side is going to do anything about it somebody should have did something about that because then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him you know get in line and uh so he knew he could get by with it 

Recording: (290/ 9618) 
and the fact that i recognized all that and could not waite to get out of there and when i was gone i was gone and and even now we still have this on linge thing where my  in fact hiy have been real unhappy about them latly because um i have we have lived in our same house for twenty years and my pharents they they live in florida they u i mean they are not well to do by any means but they they are not lacking for anything and they can afford to take plaine trips and they can afford to go to cali fornia twice a year to they spend a week with my brother at cetera at cetra and they cime heare a couple times a year  and they stay at my sister is house they have only come to my home three times and twenty years and it is because they do not want to get off the free way they will drive through collumbus from florida to go to visit people in and acckran and maslon and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfille with my sisters and they will not do it because it is just too mc they do not want to have to deal with that traffick they do not like that and it is and just recently i have finally sthaid you know i do not understand why you can not do that you know i have actually calle them on i am fifty two 

Recording: (291/ 9618) 
would say there would be certain life application things that all kods should know but not i do not a think that you caud say everything you know you have everybody has to do this because you know people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration i think so 

Recording: (292/ 9618) 
i know 

Recording: (293/ 9618) 
yeah it was 

Recording: (294/ 9618) 
well i really think that is happening right now because i think that i do not know what the divorcestatistics have been recently but i do  see that more people who are getting married are staying married because thorse that do not those that would have gotten a divorce they are not bothering to get married to begin with they are just living together and tt t they separate so what and i think that 

Recording: (295/ 9618) 
um i talk to them every now and then 

Recording: (296/ 9618) 
you know white napkins and you know we go there for lunch you know youd dress nice and uh yoau know i i like that and i would uh like you know my greaand kids to be able to go downtown with me like that you know rather than have to drive off to a mall 

Recording: (297/ 9618) 
eah that part was no different i am no 

Recording: (298/ 9618) 
they had a tuby for on the door for over a month 

Recording: (299/ 9618) 
now that  tha would go over a whille here would not it 

Recording: (300/ 9618) 
so thca 

Recording: (301/ 9618) 
i mean he would have he would have been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there and uh while while i was down there he had me sleeping in a truck a moving truck and uh oh i mean it was it is a hillarious story i mean thirty foot moving truck a i am sleeping in it and i get uh 

Recording: (302/ 9618) 
now who does he work for 

Recording: (303/ 9618) 
and some of that is controled with medication now but not all of it because he because of the drug and alcohol they will n put him on some of the medications so but as far as i can tell he is been pretty clear and clean on that and uh you know once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking she is taking very good care of herself she uh she lately has been going with him to the sychologist and u u we have been paying for er but we do not have a problem with that because he is going he likes the sychologist so took a long time to get to that point but uh so we have been tal king to the sychologist about it and he said  she he said most people thatre raised in that backgroundd he said diy e go difdifferent ways ones they they just fall into the same uh pattern as a parents or theira surviver and she appears to be a surviver uh she is never really had what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us uh which i am glad uh and she we really like her she is really we enjoyed being with her but sometimes moe with thim being with my son uh 

Recording: (304/ 9618) 
so i i try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk 

Recording: (305/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (306/ 9618) 
and just took it and wripped it 

Recording: (307/ 9618) 
oh it is possible but i can not imagine it would  i not knowing how big it is going to get i guess i can not imagine 

Recording: (308/ 9618) 
i o knowi 

Recording: (309/ 9618) 
h 

Recording: (310/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (311/ 9618) 
suck down ta hill kind of by the horse yeah yeah so that is where we go and i do not have student idea so i just sneak in but it is the summer they do not even care they never 

Recording: (312/ 9618) 
itink i think they shod um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation or that you can be converted to homosexualidy and i personally do not believe that so it ih you know i am not afraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this co comes from but since i think they are wrong  i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it you know dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessible to the kids 

Recording: (313/ 9618) 
yeah yeah i heard something about that 

Recording: (314/ 9618) 
i retired about uh four years ago from this state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state wheni was school here i worked here and that counted those five years cound of towards retirement so i was able to retire early and then u last uh about the last two and a half years i have been working at the symphony in the box office started part time and then i was full time for a while and then i requested it to be cut back to part time again because uh 

Recording: (315/ 9618)

Recording: (316/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (317/ 9618) 
umum 

Recording: (318/ 9618) 
okay so is it like a kind of snobbish or are they u 

Recording: (319/ 9618) 
i not really uh big fan uh i think one of the big problems is going to be uh uh initially just the uh uh the monitary thing ofbut you know the people that supported the uh basically supported the uh uh monorly teams that they had here you know wt were like blue collor people withat you go for twenty thirty bucks and have a good time good drunk throgh beerd and and up there you renw you are not going to be able to do that t is going to cost you uh u minnam of a fifty to a hundreed dollars probably to take a fanmily a couple kids or something like that you know 

Recording: (320/ 9618) 
oor anything like that i mean that is something that i do not know i would sort of make known to them but not something that i would really push on them 

Recording: (321/ 9618) 
ye 

Recording: (322/ 9618) 
actually i that is what got me interested ind so i went to the library school and 

Recording: (323/ 9618) 
umhum

Recording: (325/ 9618) 
since i have been on both worlds 

Recording: (326/ 9618) 
it was not publiciso theh degree that it is now it seems like anymore nothings sacred i mean as far as the papers are concerned and uh as something else that i aguess i am old fationd but i do not think we need all thes poblicitly about all the sexual escapades of all the people that are notorize and have notarious lives uh ey just uh a say maybe i am old fasioned but i and e i can hardly concieve anyone being a genuan homosexual i mean evidently they are but uh it is so against human nature i think are against conventional human nature anyway 

Recording: (327/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (328/ 9618) 
she helped a lot 

Recording: (329/ 9618)

it is regularis enough for me in that and i did not have i could not schedule the howners 

Recording: (333/ 9618) 
we took um or i took uh military ethics as a pilosophy course and that was really interesting because even though in even in that higerarky there is still certain contects within the contects of war for instance if if we both know if wed knowingly go into it as combattants and we are fighting for whatever cause but if we both are willingly going into it 

Recording: (334/ 9618) 
no every once and a while with my grandmother she always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school han she died and sometimes i think boy she w really liked it that i was a nurse because i still use her blood pressure cuff and everything she had given me her blood pressure cuffh i mean it is very old 

Recording: (335/ 9618)

Recording: (336/ 9618)

Recording: (337/ 9618) 
yeah my grandmother is from ireland my grandmother and grandfather are both from ireland 

Recording: (338/ 9618)

Recording: (340/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (341/ 9618) 
well that is the other thing they are a lot of times they are good in the arts they are either an artist i have a boy right now that is an eighth grader that is painting a huge canvas for me for my living room because i have not been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture and he is ndnlarging an an painting it for me and his freetime and it is going to go in my living room and i mean it is it is i mean he is really quite the artist and music arts u literature acting i have had kids that have been like really top noch actors in the school plays it it is just not necessarily a school cine tha thing that they are going to be good at but i tried to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently is no reason to think they will not be successful in life marks sfits one an olimpic gold medtal he has a learning disability shar bono can not remember a phone number without transposing two of the numbers e she says that herself um inestine did not learn to read untill he was twelve um winston churchill he studered until he was like seven or eight uh wallt disney was told by a manager a wol worse that he would never have a creative idea in his life 

Recording: (342/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (343/ 9618) 
um i it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it you know we are very strict as far as what games they have no you know it is so wild you know when we were kids cowboy and indians averybay had guns everybody you know if you had the best death act you were the best you know and and nowadays so oh do not let him have a gun you know do not let him play with you know even a squirt gun you know ands uh you wonder whether it is over exagerated or you know none of us grew up shooting people or thes you know we do not own an firearms but we played with guns and played col all these games and so i just wonder whether this is really you know but society is a lot different now 

Recording: (344/ 9618) 
yeah they are going to most likely raise it up to twenty one since all these uh the kentucky and maryland colorado all those schools shootings and can not believe me i mean there is articles in there you would not it even believe if you have not read them 

Recording: (345/ 9618) 
most of my friends 

Recording: (346/ 9618) 
umhumand they should and very rarely do doctors even ask you about alorgies and i more and more and people do not even realize hand they get sick so often they need to ask about alorgies or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people when they can not figure out what is wrong with them because a lot of times it is alergic reactions to things they have eaten 

Recording: (347/ 9618)

Recording: (392/ 9618) 
they uhwhat they 

Recording: (393/ 9618) 
tho i have not been paying a lot of attention to it just because o know 

Recording: (394/ 9618)

Recording: (396/ 9618) 
o 

Recording: (397/ 9618) 
now well he right now he is really interested in eastern religions i am not sure where that came from you know when they go to college and tey are gone an you do not see him much uh that is what he is interested in right now so i do not think it it it it really took

Recording: (401/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (402/ 9618) 
and theirs needs were immediate 

Recording: (403/ 9618) 
it is so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is going ta happen to me eventually 

Recording: (404/ 9618) 
i was going to say ie i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to they still do not want ta go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is allamoney and all that kind of thing and and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know 

Recording: (405/ 9618) 
areyouom 

Recording: (406/ 9618) 
um i think the fact things like responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know thinks as far as people getting pregnant and and then this person goes off and and youh tend you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and it is just it is more socially acceptable to to be able to do these things now than i think it was a long time ago i mean people is families when and when novor stand for something like that they they look you need to take care of thus you need to deal with us and now it is just i kind of moramile and everybody just kind of goes along with it 

Recording: (407/ 9618) 
aall all the kids in the world all that that will happen to that that influence all the kids 

Recording: (408/ 9618)

Recording: (426/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (427/ 9618) 
yeah that is true well we went all whays yeurs they have got a nice facility i mean they have a uh uh like a labor ind delivery room tit is got like it is weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this worldpool baffing your room it i do not kow if yu have hard tho se commercials or not but therve there is only one oom that is like that

Recording: (470/ 9618) 
when my son startedyou kno y son startedn public school for kindergartand and he just my son is my son is a very social child we will say he is the one that talks too much as the teacher say he is a social child he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured i he needs the time to run around but he needs something very structured yeu get himg yeu nr a bunch of  i thef kids when he was little and it was like he would just run int scream at them because he was ready to play well yeah and yeah my and my daugh my daughter is the opposite of that uh but he would do that and so he was not he was very  he was not learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble and it is like an i do not kno we would be told he was a problem but he did not ender stayhim what was going on and iere  if there was not a structure he would go to school every day and not know what to expec ecause there was not like thist we will do this and thend we will do this and we will do this so whe checked out the catholic schooland they were orgeng nice that way and it is just was a better better match for him and then when my daughter went to school it was just easier to take him to the same schoolyo now and and tdhad goms back t andemight e of another thing i wantd to say about my the discipline and and behavior may be different inin the catholic schol is yeu paying big you paying bucks you know it is a fourut forty five ender dollars a year for us to send her to school uh yoa n if we find out she is not doing her work it is a very different perspective 

Recording: (471/ 9618)

Recording: (472/ 9618) 
is it oh that is a good day 

Recording: (473/ 9618) 
yes for attention and uh yeah 

Recording: (474/ 9618) 
umhum umhum but i do not know if that is i think the the divorce rate has gone up because it is more socially acceptable i am sure there is plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have got a divorce had that been an option um i i think it s just i think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it you know how you how you handle it after after theh divorce is final i mean not do you see what does that make any sense at all 

Recording: (475/ 9618) 
i well you know i i do not see how we can say i mean i mean we can refuse to to see certain classes of movies or or watch certain classes of shows but i you know without getting into that first amendment thing i can not i you knowi do not see how we can have a code of conduct yeah yeaw wey i do not know i i you know i havehae never seen it happen in in my life time you know so i do not i do not ow f it could be but then f course it can not go on the csame way wori you know i can not keep progressing i do not think 

Recording: (476/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (477/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (478/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (479/ 9618) 
uh essentially dying and so we were dealing with all of this at the same time and it was i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we would heard from him uh and got a message that my motherinlaw had fallen and she was in a emergency room the same hospital fortunatly so we went down there then on the way home got a phone call on the sellphone uh from the hospital that my fatherinlaw had had some bleading so we had to go back to the hospital and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was and this was not unusual ita horrible period and uh i think what made my wife and ite angry us was he is the only one that really could control his behavior the others could not 

Recording: (480/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (481/ 9618) 
that is not a shocking surprise i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they do not understand mauth either even though it is very concrete 

Recording: (482/ 9618) 
government does not seem to work too swiftly 

Recording: (483/ 9618) 
yeah it is a really disciplined school but it is a lot of rebellion an at the same time 

Recording: (484/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (485/ 9618) 
sometimes i think that it is just like math sox and it is like 

Recording: (486/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (487/ 9618) 
exactly huge 

Recording: (488/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (489/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (490/ 9618) 
it is just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 

Recording: (491/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (492/ 9618) 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the the girls shouldw both of them should love their bodies and not you know give it to a boy that is you know violent all over you and youare you you feel all good in this and that you should respect yourself and love your body and you know do not let do not give yourself to somebody just because you are feeling you are feeling good um and the boys i should  the boys meed to calm down  um  i i mean 

Recording: (493/ 9618) 
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 

Recording: (494/ 9618) 
xtac es there are a few people that i know that use it 

Recording: (495/ 9618) 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can not really answer that question how they would have voted because i did not think that mike colman exactly had corisma either 

Recording: (496/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (497/ 9618) 
we are buying it yeah and we should have ta paid offi about five years sod then we are talking about moving to some place a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (498/ 9618) 
do not know like i think u i think uh high school ind general like the i people a ways talk about raising the standards you know for for high school tings but um i think um it is kind of like it is it is really hard to to like i havethought about before just what is wrong with like the education system in general like i do not know i think it is more of uh more of like uh it is college is a little bit different i guess but it is more of like this whole like the teacher the teachers talking iai like it like the information goes from like the like the teachers uh mouth to the students to know it is with like out go without going through either their brains you know it is like just like real manotonous and like you know dates and bbbula about you know just like it is it is  it is real structured but it is real hard to think about what the what ike what to do to change that  it is kind of like more like i donot know i mean i had really good like there was acouple o relly good teachers like my history teachers ande english teachers were really good um 

Recording: (499/ 9618) 
was she where is she was from ot in america 

Recording: (500/ 9618) 
no 

Recording: (501/ 9618) 
yousee 

Recording: (502/ 9618) 
and you do not the problem is as a youngster as you grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably until you are about thirty five forty yo do not realize my goodness myam dad you made a sacrifice because now i am learning and litle moran what you did and then by the time you are uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you guy take care of take care of your parents if you had the morals to do it otherwise you just ship them out to the farms 

Recording: (503/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (504/ 9618) 
the three ars you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (505/ 9618) 
all rght and they were actually able to select a couple from a they talked to a lawyer who rangees options and she had a file and they you know through kind of bunch of questions and the answers type thand we ere able to limit to u the three couples and they liked the first couple they met so 

Recording: (506/ 9618) 
go along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (507/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (508/ 9618) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (509/ 9618) 
and a lot of it was the the bitterness of the divorce 

Recording: (510/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (511/ 9618) 
yea 

Recording: (512/ 9618) 
hey do not do it today unless tha person is a scholler i mean a you kow three point eight road scar or anything hey okay 

Recording: (513/ 9618) 
so it i it is been very difficult for us particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was between the time my fatherinlaw died and my motherinlaw died which was in a five month period so my wife is had a lot lot to deal with uh and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (514/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (515/ 9618) 
just 

Recording: (516/ 9618) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him uthanized 

Recording: (517/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (518/ 9618) 
no i would not av 

Recording: (519/ 9618) 
getting them some place stable 

Recording: (520/ 9618) 
i think it is the right position to take um but it  like abbortion that is one of the the big issues that divide people very quickly uh i think it is moderating somewhat uh as the gay activist continue their campaigns um but that is one worda candidate has to tread very carefully um i was proud that colman said it and did it and and did not back down on that u they told me a little bit about his character um i do not know that i can answer your questions straight forward because i believe in gayright i believe in anybody is rights in what happens between concenting adults and a bedroom is their business not mine 

Recording: (521/ 9618) 
yeah it was like yeah uht was five weeks early delivering so it was really you know unplanned as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (522/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (523/ 9618) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with um chief jackson and the whole mayorial candidates how they are getting debates over that and i know this is something new on top of that um and it was a front page on sunday is paper i looked at it briefly um i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (524/ 9618) 
well i would say in springfilled ya 

Recording: (525/ 9618) 
right rightand i think there is i onw there s so many small communities like even though osyu is really obviously it is own it is own little community and then you have got you know dublen and they have got their own parades an their own different things so i agree i mean i think that that there really is a lot of things to do in tha own individual area that i can not see somebody from doublen going over to the west side to to do it you you know what i i do not and and maybe also i i feel safer where i live too and and that is something that is an issue for me i know when i do travel down i cleveland aveoit makes it does it makes me nervous so i just kind of stay away fo um 

Recording: (526/ 9618) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (527/ 9618) 
i was forty eight when i retiredit s uh it is great it was terrific 

Recording: (528/ 9618) 
now well it is like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping the fun part you gout pick out wall paper and cabinets and all this and tat andthen yu has some body else do that far but i do not do like major gutding or anything i just like to get something that needs that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen that bba bobabbaba so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (529/ 9618) 
um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see over there that prevents it you know there a sort of middlof te line dress that would be like it the limited here or something is you know seventy five pounds you know i like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them and limiteded and you think whatever the price is expensive but you know really if you buy that you are not really going to be buying f you know more than one or like anything else for a while and i think i mean here there is that sort of like you know you has the mosto wins or whatever that you know prases and you know there is that wit cds and whatever but i do not know i mean even with the food and everything else i mean it is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big becaus the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there you know the portions or a lot smaller it is more expensive you just yeat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean  the obcity problem here and everything else i mean it is getting worse there than it wase but i mean it is nowhere is it anywhere ner and that is a large part of the like problem with that people work constantly on me about aare americans so fun like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (530/ 9618) 
no 

Recording: (531/ 9618) 
i get a job at at highde park so that will i mean it is just amazing because the money is so good you know you really can not bee at i only haftr  work three or four and nights a week and i nt leve my whole day free for classes and whatever um highde park grill it is ah it is a restaurant s up in doublin so i do not know i mean i i did that all through high school and college and after i actually after i graduated from high school i ammoveed ta restaurant for about a year and a half

Recording: (534/ 9618) 
has to be a longstanding kind of thing yeah you know and that that worries me more than um i i undersand a lot of the objection is because this is just uh this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know uh you know one legal step leads to another legal step and then we will have gave marriage and all those things but i do not think that would be a bad thing either 

Recording: (535/ 9618)

answered an ad ind the paper uh but i have sung in the well shan sings in the symphony courus too i have sung in it for sixteen years 

Recording: (673/ 9618) 
yep 

Recording: (674/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (675/ 9618) 
yeah i just renewed myirtificut last year so i may get back into it part of the reason i renewed my cirtificat was i did somec chome instruction with acolumbus publics schools lass year and thatis kind of like a tutering job where you can go inarrange hours with the student that is at home for some reason uh i had one that just had a baby  and uh they it is an interesting job because they looked for somebody that can cover the most technical li guess subjec that the student is taking in my case at turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry onc and it it was uh aljibra to another time  but they expected us to at least they expected me uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was englis and there was history  so it really requires you to be well rounded  and i i like kind of liked that uh i have taught in a couple of other places uh ommunity colleges  college in new werk i tought a chemistry class there and  community college which is in hillsborog but i taught it ther branch and i taught ah introduc an introduction to a collegy class there an an introdction to uh inroduction to the arts was called  and that was interesting it was  thether it is kind of an under class of teachers they do not payy you know enough to do that they pay you uh perx student contact hour and  ind my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty dollars an hour  so 

Recording: (676/ 9618) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is your perspective in that sense 

Recording: (677/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (678/ 9618) 
okay it was kind of uh it was different when i cau see because when i went in uh me you kno i never had any problem with ha black person or or i do not really care you know as long as they uh did their job and everything i am basiceally the same way today uh 

Recording: (679/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (680/ 9618) 
that is not enough uhhuh 

Recording: (681/ 9618) 
what they do uh they have like up to four or five months the first four or five months of pregnancy they are alowed to maintain once they start to show they do not let them go to the school anymore just for the uh health of the baby 

Recording: (682/ 9618) 
umhum pussh i guess hoam many different students and well i like just walking over here today you know i just kind of thought you knowuh i monder how many of these people i walk by you know are going to be here in january because  you know a lot because i did you know i thought l this is cold maw you know 

Recording: (683/ 9618) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people um bitch ang complain all the time but then when you askd them if they voteed they go know it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political action consulting for the ohigho education association i used to go around a try to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is import and jon kenedy won if if if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per per per presinct one vote per presinct you know  thre i just been one additional vote either way and any of those precings you know he would have lost uh and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohigho education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two ceven eighteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9618) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i would say he knows more than most kindergartdeners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedual right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we will go to different websight sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometybes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is he listens to everythin 

Recording: (685/ 9618) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposly tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from hilard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad 

Recording: (686/ 9618) 
and he said even in  when he was in high school that they had they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people w like nives adyouwould have people with fist fights but you ld like guns it was unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh ther people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it you know like i do not i was i did not feel that way but i would like in retrouspect i looked back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day it was like so tramatizing to them like that would be like for four years every day you are just like teased or something like horrible and yu like no one talks to you i damot not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (687/ 9618) 
and he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure in a situation like that things are going to come up but weil we will deal with it 

Recording: (688/ 9618) 
no 

Recording: (689/ 9618) 
umhum yeah mi mom are real close 

Recording: (690/ 9618) 
i do i do um art fairs 

Recording: (691/ 9618) 
you know and and it is just i think that in that happens so often there is so many people or even that whole thing with bok it an when you are talking circles around yourself but you never say anything 

Recording: (692/ 9618) 
yeah and i told them i was gong to call up the tv stations so they could fil me cralwling out the door as an osu employee 

Recording: (693/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (694/ 9618) 
i checke my fax machine the neext day itcids my mother is decided to except yhour offer and i thought a said i h wa visit and we one goyn going to do now so i ended up talking to him and i i just explained to him that um he had caught me off gard and that i would had more time to reconsider it and that because if and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said tat that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me he was a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it 

Recording: (695/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (696/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (697/ 9618) 
well one thing you know being uh uh i came from basically a poor nr ppor uh uh life style in early life and everything you know so uh uh if anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh towards people  that had inphiuense an had money in did not do any thing good with that you know i am a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with uther other people i do not always practiced what i preached but you know that is that would be a good philosophy to liv uh uh and people of other religions and everything uh you know i  learnd a lot about religion when i i was raised baptist basically but uh i  practiced more catholic than anything else now uh but iam generally pretty nowlegeable about judeisom than muslins and everything just because i as prin i interesting 

Recording: (698/ 9618) 
friend who her name t she is not really a friend  she was a teacher when i was in college her name was misis cosy and she got pregnant and she said everybody said she came in one day and said it is a girl it is a girl i found out it is a girl what are you goin to name her rosy rosy cosy you have got to be kidding she is um just putting you on uh 

Recording: (699/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (700/ 9618) 
i do not think it is really i do not think it is really affected me ith i mean obviously there is amate or places to go shopping or to eat orou there is more traffic which i do not particularly care much for um but it i do not think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood it is it was where you you went to school with the people once at least once i went to high school i went to public school 

Recording: (701/ 9618) 
what deparment 

Recording: (702/ 9618) 
and anymore you are lucky if you know youre neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the peoplet you are hearing about it on tv or radio or buy a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (703/ 9618) 
very very much so now wety fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would c we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we just defined socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are no longer a  democratic government as defined back there then uh yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition it is developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but 

Recording: (704/ 9618)

Recording: (720/ 9618) 
i think it was a a nice thing about wha we had uh we had uh grandparents that weere not necessarly they were out of state in some cases we did not see them that much we made a part that uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly and when we did it was a special timeh we uh emphasize the fact that uh uh you know the kids wanted to do certain things okay they saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to work for that uh aspect we uh asked them that they wanted to go on uh a project with the class of worth fine but you gotto participate in it too wel we will match you with what you come up with we made them part of the owner we gave them a responsibilities they grew up with that aspect they learned by being around some older people uh which uh i think it was good 

Recording: (721/ 9618) 
um yeah 

Recording: (722/ 9618) 
pretty much yeah is he come easy go follow leader monky in the middle whatever 

Recording: (723/ 9618)

and it was just whene drug culture was just you know starting we leaned about it in school and stuff but now my parents never sat down with me or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but today with teenagers and everything sow out in the open you have to talk to them about things and just say you know i want to help you and i you know be there for them a hundred percent obviously  those parents were too busy with their own lives to realives what their children were doing so i think they are the ones to be to blame i do 

Recording: (733/ 9618) 
yeah that was pretty bad i think they i do not know what happened 

Recording: (734/ 9618) 
only the only can do it i mean seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that but people who have guns and in their home and not have them locked up or in a you know in a place that no child could find it they are to blame they are they are to blame um that whole thing with the um school out in colorado um i forget the name of it it yeah but when they said that those boys were making those guns an the garage and then parents did not were clueless i just find thot really hard to believe if a child goes into a garage every night and you hear clanging and and they are buying gun mettal and you know i then they were totally um not in tune with what their kids were doing it is one thing them having a sighte on the inter net 

Recording: (735/ 9618) 
i 

Recording: (736/ 9618) 
yeah i have got i have gotm plenty of people it is funny jacon is mom asked me so is your mom going to come and stay with you for a week i said no i telld my mom she started laugfing because i mean of course for her to come over and help out as terrific but if she actually stayed a bya house for a week i think we u jid skill eachothe 

Recording: (737/ 9618)

Recording: (738/ 9618) 
yeah yeah it might be umhum um 

Recording: (739/ 9618) 
four parties so because it is actually a market it is all done outside like tonight we are going to the uh gobborth pavilion which is um it next to the highe theaterd it is really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (740/ 9618) 
yeah it is real it is like one of the closest bires and we go there because they have a huge pateo and so you can just sit out and talk and and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too like we just bought acxcess and alis me and my roommates 

Recording: (741/ 9618) 
well i grew up with just my mom theyre she had four kids and i was a very quiet and did very well in school 

Recording: (742/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (743/ 9618) 
credit cards 

Recording: (744/ 9618) 
that is what you want 

Recording: (745/ 9618) 
um so i just you know it was something i was a little familiar with anyway uh and i was just looking for something part time 

Recording: (746/ 9618) 
um i guess that would be slightly different part of men i am not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but i mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 

Recording: (747/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (748/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (749/ 9618) 
well no actually my mom did not she was a very bad cook 

Recording: (750/ 9618) 
um and that hurt her to go she thought she wasing you know neglecting me i ink 

Recording: (751/ 9618) 
plus i do not really feel like the republican party represents the popular said a whole like at their last political convention like in uh the last presidential election i ninety six they said one and ten of the delegates that were  attending  the convention we are millionaires great an i know more than ten people and not you know at i mean so to me i just feel like that is not a good representation 

Recording: (752/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (753/ 9618) 
mhum 

Recording: (754/ 9618) 
yeah so 

Recording: (755/ 9618) 
and because largely because of the fear of not knowing and not knowing how to deal with the unceen 

Recording: (756/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (757/ 9618) 
i mean  dothy teters obviously been around for a really long time and i i would tip i my views are typically a little bit more democratic but iam not to say that i certainly would not vote um for the person that i thought would be the best job 

Recording: (758/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (759/ 9618) 
umhum at this point um i am not a uh i am not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i would  move to a suburban area until collumbus gets their act together they are in so such bad shape right now that i do think the state will take over the collumbus public schools in two years yeah they have threatened it um and if they do not pull their scores up um they will you know 

Recording: (760/ 9618) 
and i have you know i have  got a couple in chicago and and i have a couple in uh the washington area 

Recording: (761/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (762/ 9618) 
once they turn to adult whood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i do not think that has anything to do with it 

Recording: (763/ 9618) 
the runnaways uh well i think the youngest that i met was maybe twelve but that is you know still young 

Recording: (764/ 9618) 
well you know it because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else but i am sure i am sure that i did not pay more than three thousand on it and it you know i did not cost me more than three thousand and so if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy 

Recording: (765/ 9618) 
i do not know that is kind of a tricky question really because one one hand obviously the kid definitely will get uh made fon of atise  things like that 

Recording: (766/ 9618) 
well the thing is there is things you can not explain 

Recording: (767/ 9618) 
my sister is last name is goodnight and when she had her first little girl she said she is going to name her dan and good night but she did not she did not 

Recording: (768/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (769/ 9618) 
i mean i i  i had parents that everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i could not do this could not do that and and so what i try to do is when anything comes up i aways think of how my parents would handle it and i do a hundred and eighty degrees so you know because you know they just i do not know how i got i sort of feel i am mentally okay now but i do not know how i got here because i have been the other way you know and it is you know 

Recording: (770/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (771/ 9618) 
ell i think sometimes that it is because tha child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown i have always been he cine a persson to uta l  i never told my kids not to do something that i am myself was doing example smoking cigarets or taking a drink a beer or taking a whine with my dinner say now you r noy older y bhat i can now there are some things that the kids can not do at this age at somebody can not at another age bossiblet i go out on a date for example well who is going ot but pory waker and i well he is already sixteen yearas old ad a way to yoear sixteen years old and you wiul feel lot to go to par is but was by that ti am all expecti  bigebue you know  knoy what to do uh but i mean i never did uh and i know well i will not give you any exsaamples but anyway if if i told them they could not do it i would try am swearing is one of my bad habits and i know that uh i woul try i very very hard i got taught one time that i wa btter watch d a lite more carefuly by my on little girl uh but anyway i would always and i would appologize if they did catch me doing something tat i hav ben telling them know you cannot do i would appologize a saying momme was bad a momme did that i got souop in my mouth one time becouse well well oh know i mean now if you want to hear the story in punny  ovr tv just teeny bit i was bicking a py and i was taking this pye out of the oven i was a cherry pier and aple pi one of those that can get juicy sometimes and i had not put any a limlen n foileor an thay y ythir to catch it and just as i started to get it out i spilled it and i said i  would wored you know and just as i said that wored leanyng down here here is two little shoes 

Recording: (772/ 9618)

Recording: (782/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (783/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (784/ 9618) 
yeah and that well it is it is just the same as when i was a kid

Recording: (790/ 9618) 
but they said all along they were gay they just fought it and they they did not want the pressure from their families 

Recording: (791/ 9618) 
i think so i think so um it is it is so sad to see a girl you knowm have so many options closed off ou know i do not mean it is by any streatch sthat it is a tragedy to have a baby but um somebody in high school is is making a lot of decisions she does not intend to make 

Recording: (792/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (793/ 9618) 
because uh again i said you bring up you get wisdom from tha as long as you are listening to them uh some people iod not care what their age ar they just blew them off uh so that plus you have the i think an understanding of um the schooling they came from um 

Recording: (794/ 9618) 
familiar with sarcoviesoh 

Recording: (795/ 9618)

l i am i am sure i am sure australia you know welcomes all those dollars but the they have like little like a like a like a wetting industry 

Recording: (804/ 9618) 
a famous one 

Recording: (805/ 9618) 
i have never heard anybody go on a shooting rampae that were high on pop most of them ware sitting home waiting on a pisa 

Recording: (806/ 9618) 
gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh i know where yo are coming from and being confronted with that when i was a high estate and so forth and um so i just slated down the line to her 

Recording: (807/ 9618) 
i got on birth control probably when i was like sixteen or seventeen but still i did not take the pills all the time and you know that was not very good for me either 

Recording: (808/ 9618) 
it is like you know like some of these places in florida kind of like a ruind by tourist you know like fort laudadal datona you know it is like after after the kids get done  you know  they just like it well you know forget it it is like i because um i used toi when i was in and um like a freshman um i heard it i hard it like domean go to florida bcaus like they they do not want students  you know bt they want your money but they do not like it they do not like you are they do not like you know tha that the trash and and the whatnot that they bring 

Recording: (809/ 9618) 
yeh umhum 

Recording: (810/ 9618) 
depends whon who is the manager is at the time every manager is got a different adgentaon what they want you to do 

Recording: (811/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (812/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (813/ 9618) 
know she sort of knows this is what she has to say at school if she is asked ong to test because she needs the points for the grade 

Recording: (814/ 9618) 
the one girl had um showed her er her altrasown and then that is one is like ol thi s is cute and like well wait a minute i thought yhou was against it they are not always against it though 

Recording: (815/ 9618) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or you know something like that you call the contrary i will be in thursday you know if your air condittions so they are always going to have to have people here so i just feel they are either better to down scale the amount of people that have and get highly qualified people then havetwenty people that half of them know what is going on hap of m do not so but that is tough to do when you are starting people what eight dollars an hour and stuff so there is you know win tese a mcdonaalds there is he places that you can make that money soff umhum my you know to me the thing that hurt me the mos tauto is they want to put caps on our salary so i am at the highest scale i can go right now as far as job tigtle there is no other job i can move to intil less i move into supervision or someth up and that and i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are going no put a cap on that where you cauld only make so much money  at ha point which i am almost there right now i am only like fifty cents away from that cap and if that is the case if ie retire in six years i will be capped out right nowso that in other words i am going to retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i mahke now which that whas my wors feare of it all but that was not even on the negotiating table they were still worried about this two doll theres an get this os yeah that is what they weare fighting for was the low end and try to get the hospitale on the main campus the same 

Recording: (816/ 9618) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to doi mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traft or who could not you would be a millionar because thegovernment would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean i are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then te other people uh that i know of one that i work with  on a regular basis he is got a master is degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on and overceas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weakest ones you know and it is uh 

Recording: (817/ 9618)

Recording: (824/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (825/ 9618)

it might have been where the president lived they sometimes have like a mission home 

Recording: (836/ 9618) 
for whatevte reason 

Recording: (837/ 9618) 
that and i i imagine that is about half an half right now or maybe it is more on this side i do not know so i think that that really is ev a at and neve olution at this time tell you the truth what is going to cause the world to end i think what they really mean but by that i hope what they mean by that is that it will in the way it is being run or the way itis being acted out today and that people will be more compastionate toward each other and jus be happy and content and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to reay be lieve ming there is a god and believe mg that you should take the other person into consideration and my sound very bastic but it is very the very hard thing to accomplish especially when they have gotten into this like you said me me me and i got i had this and that status symble stuff and really if we older people could get out there may be and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids because i know i myself in my own home i have been a collector now i take this back to the depression years when i did not have anything and my father one time when he wis out tof work i guess what i do not knwhat whell of her agens ee it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first dall baby i ever had and i remember when i tryed to warch a thing off that little dall was one of there is ae sort of melled in the water and my my mother said well if you do notknow ht to take care of but any beter not  never bouy you another one and believe me she did not

Recording: (943/ 9618) 
yeah they are very quantitative as upposed o like the quality and then so the analesis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that is what i do not like like i like business and i i enjoy my business classes but some of the people in my business classes i cannot stand because they honestly they are like oh it does not matter how you treat people and then it is all about the bottom line well tel in in my opinion theywill end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire new employee and if you have constant turn over things like that then and if you have a product and that because obviously people are not going nto care you know so and they theyre they seem very close minded like like this is the way business has to be but the professors do not seem to be necessarily like that maybe i am coming too far going to one extreme 

Recording: (944/ 9618)

really 

Recording: (949/ 9618) 
and you have been going to a hih state that whole time 

Recording: (950/ 9618) 
and people do not seem to understand that uh it is not like you are collecting data for the entire population or the entire universe youar working with a sample trying to represent the entire universe well sometimes it is good and sometimes it is not 

Recording: (951/ 9618) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (952/ 9618) 
um i mean 

Recording: (953/ 9618) 
even in the package of informatiion 

Recording: (954/ 9618) 
take them to the grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but and i do not do it as regularly now because of the advance and age you know 

Recording: (955/ 9618) 
yeah i um well and that was really um struggle you know a struggle for money and everything so i would take whatever would come along and when you work insecure jobs like that i mean ou i had a different job every year i mean ta year it would come up and i would say o okay here we go you know they are either going ta downsize or they are goin to do something and they always did so i was never really shocked and i did not panic or anything and i was never without a job and never had to i never missed um you know i would say it would take probably two weeks at the most before i would be working again yeah 

Recording: (956/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (957/ 9618) 
yeah you w a lot of educated people who are not out to just make a bunch of money so it makes for an very intellectual interesting environment but people are trying to live simply there and i kind of agree with that 

Recording: (958/ 9618) 
yes you are you are saying you do not need to have a leader in a family and if i am going to be a leader i am going to be the one i am going to be the one not the sprim bank oh you came from this little tube here ohokay that is the principal vant no i have to be because there is no father here well

Recording: (962/ 9618) 
umhuh 

Recording: (963/ 9618)

Recording: (964/ 9618) 
nd like the social aspects o the we ware the problem so

so they are kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent anit is kind of how it is divided out between the projects 

Recording: (969/ 9618) 
that uh that is an interesting question because he was a a serious contender last time i have not heard his name this time um what people say they would do  you know that they like him because he is um intelligent carismatic u all those those neat things that you need to to be elected today um and a lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in poles iy do not know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could i think the right candidate could and i think mihke colman this year uh in the columbus raceshowe that i mean he crossed gender lignes he crossed um party lines he crossed over into all of the city and winning even dorthy teater is precinkt which surprised meyou know and n and not by just a little small margine i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial 

Recording: (970/ 9618) 
umhum

Recording: (974/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (975/ 9618)

Recording: (985/ 9618) 
how do you picture i 

Recording: (986/ 9618)

Recording: (987/ 9618) 
oh yes they are getting better though they really are they are much better now thand they were twenty years ago because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible so teachers are having to learn to for example

Recording: (999/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1000/ 9618) 
eh 

Recording: (1001/ 9618) 
i think what them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and you know look all over the place for different e you look on the screen it is different you say well i would have done this in asnis but you know down on the field they have to think that they are going to be doing this you know

something like that i do not i do not know much about it 

Recording: (1010/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1011/ 9618) 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of uh ou in the in the first three months of t first quarter so uh then i got my notice in january so 

Recording: (1012/ 9618) 
i mean theye are people whot think cars will notn 

Recording: (1013/ 9618) 
yeah getting me to pay the rent and  that is yeah 

Recording: (1014/ 9618) 
so we have even been known to lately start pulling out you know let the garage door go down i would sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she is on the couch and she is like i am cat  i tellher 

Recording: (1015/ 9618) 
and then i got my master is in seventy five so it took me four years that way no i never i just was smart enough to do it before i had kids 

Recording: (1016/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1017/ 9618) 
and aparently that is away of endisteuing anta conversation uh one of the guys i usually go clubbing with he is going to got meu in to the low stick dancing and he said uh he says that is lke a sige that says come hit on me ou  i am like oh great that is that is just what i need not does not bother me noes not bother me i just i jus i sort of just i am jut like not you know i am straight if they start if they start getting really you know really push you about it i am just like i am straiht but a lot of times it is really funny because i will gttingithe conversation with them and they will bel like you are straight are not you i am like yeat theyre yeah they i do not know how but they must  it is just ben i must guess it must be the way i talk or or or something but i think i keep a lot of them away because i do a lot of really i do a lot of rally robust movements with my glote stics sometf like flailing about and you know it is like this you knw i got this wide birth around me yeah it it is not one of these it is when of these and yeua know int is yeah umhum hum yeh 

Recording: (1018/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1019/ 9618) 
oh not very right o and i twenty twenty years first twenty years i worked at the buro i was worked in statistics so i learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they are misinterpreted and my wife as  has been a director of institutional research at the university uh at data research uh they do not really have other kinds of research there uh 

Recording: (1020/ 9618) 
you know or uh conversation piece you know or some kind of trophy well here is my here is my dog my labradoor uh yeah full and uh a lot of these people were uh the dogs were reacting and uh they were objective you know and they were because they were not being paid attention to and they were o pissing on the carpet and making messes and jun things up and and these people would bring them in and uh u have them put to sleep 

Recording: (1021/ 9618) 
so that is why she is trying to get it out of the way now because you know the the the husband he makes you know fairly decent money so you know she does an half to work right now but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know after the baby cumb she will need to work i have custody of another grandchild uh my son when he was in high school had a girl  elittle girl friend and she was a see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i guess she uh had a baby and uh believe my son was a eleventh grade when that baby was born and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and uh she uh you know my son lept to move ing to the dorm here at a ishue and she uh moved in with me i think the baby was fifteen months old and i traid to help the young lady and it just turned out that the you know the young lady was not ready to be a mother my son would not yeven now is not ready to be a father so uh there was a you know whole investigation through childrens services and uh they gave me custody of the child temporarily and e she is still theren she is four and a haf the mother is married and has another child now and and then the little oneis still with me 

Recording: (1022/ 9618) 
well no they do 

Recording: (1023/ 9618) 
not as an individual uh w i see that is a problem i have it is hard to find a balance between sensorship and you know free flow of information uh and as long as people i mean some people like this information uh jerry springer is still running wich i actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while w tikit it it is kind of interesting to watch these people uh but i mean and where do you draw the line what people should see and notsee i do not know i do not want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me wat my kids can see uh i that is my job nd if i do not want to see something on tv i will tourn it off if i do not want my kids to see something on tv we will have an argument  it used to be easy when they were little you know now you know you you  if ther twenty one and a year old and an eighteen year old it is not as easy 

Recording: (1024/ 9618) 
or likea summer project or something 

Recording: (1025/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (1026/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1027/ 9618) 
yes 

Recording: (1028/ 9618) 
if they want to get married that is their business i do not think it is mine or anyone else to say that they can not 

Recording: (1029/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (1030/ 9618) 
i think more of along the lines of like physical abuses things like that um would be probably crossing the line um like if he got there were alleged aleged uh excuse me if he was allegedly beating his wife or something like that obviously then you know than that would cause a problem with me i l i can not say that i would vote for anyone like that but i mean just like small things like that where it does not really threatn the nation or anything and i mean it is something that happened 

Recording: (1031/ 9618) 
and i have one at northan high school she is uh sofhmore there and the one at ou is a freshman and uh i am married and u what dallus i live in uh northeast collumbus by seventy one and one sixty one and that is about it 

Recording: (1032/ 9618) 
yes umhum 

Recording: (1033/ 9618) 
exactly 

Recording: (1034/ 9618) 
getting married having kids you know and have n a nice place to live 

Recording: (1035/ 9618) 
o 

Recording: (1036/ 9618) 
yeah all my family still lives around me pretty much yeah 

Recording: (1037/ 9618) 
and it only took um less than two months 

Recording: (1038/ 9618) 
donate so much  okay well ha you remember back sometime they were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave 

Recording: (1039/ 9618) 
people graduate get degrees from ohio state working here taking one course a one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them t ten years or something you know but it is like why not it is free 

Recording: (1040/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1041/ 9618) 
where i live now i have lived there for eleven years 

Recording: (1042/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (1043/ 9618) 
i thought maybe you would like crash one of the with their wedings in 

Recording: (1044/ 9618) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (1045/ 9618) 
but i have been in situations where people have told races jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick the time to to challenge someone very carefully but in other situations i have said i do not find those types of jokes funny pleas do not tell them any more in my presence you do what you want when you are with your other friends but do not do it in front of me i do not even like blond jokes i find those sexsistan racest in a way and in i no one will tell them to me one day when i was still working an in an office they were telling fifteen or twenty of them in the row and i just kept a stone vase but at one or two i did goo smile but they were trying to get me to laugh and i would not but um 

Recording: (1046/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1047/ 9618) 
okay how do you how do you get back to the original without being part of the original 

Recording: (1048/ 9618) 
i think a lot of people do not understand a lot of people do not it is a mind set u uh they do not want to deal with numbers and a lot of people or they want something easy and simple and that is what they are looking for they do not really want to know what it means uh and a statistic under any any definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind 

Recording: (1049/ 9618) 
yeah it was like freshman in a sofomore yeare 

Recording: (1050/ 9618) 
while saying wall papooning everything and saying this is dum and stuff as as far as bringing the two together like socially i think that is just a rough age 

Recording: (1051/ 9618)

Recording: (1093/ 9618) 
i got them sounds like i bought a dog

Recording: (1097/ 9618) 
you know so it is you know if you if you have a problem if you want to talk to somebody well if if somebody you know personally does not they know somebody 

Recording: (1098/ 9618) 
ou know not that what you wear makes you but he just he is a good role model 

Recording: (1099/ 9618) 
exactly 

Recording: (1100/ 9618) 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but um with domestic animals um

umhum 

Recording: (1105/ 9618) 
yeah i guess i am just so secure about who i am that i do not have a problem with it and i was in the mensgali club for a while so there is ta small percentage of the people in there that are  that are gay as well and that is and and i really made friends with a lot of them i guess i mean i guess it is just because of my personality i i i really do not know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey yout be my friend i am cool i am all righ even though i am not even thoughi am not one of you i can still be your friend which just sort of what i turian eminate because i am i am very very religious and the christian community is very is i am noke gong to say can to be i say they are chrisian community is very very mean towards homos sexuals and that is just not right i mean they are people they are makein i am mistake in my yes es but that does not mean i am gn to look at them any different way as human beings they deserve my respect oh yeah but i see everyone is engaging in cinful behavior because in my in my religion everyone is sins om i am a i am a christian i go toi am non denominational church um i do not like thenominations i am not 

Recording: (1106/ 9618) 
i a lot easier to market yourself 

Recording: (1107/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1108/ 9618) 
yeah he  he and three other people well a lot of them had signed the union they have to have almost everybody signed for it but um he was one of the people that had really been yes and so he fired them but not for that because you can not do that i is illegal so he but he sent a form letter withverybody it was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names were changed for the these like basically made up reasons 

Recording: (1109/ 9618) 
eah i have two other sisters  um one of them is well it is funny because we are all divorced uf the five of us we are all on one of them is on her third marriage and we are all on our second except for one she is divorced and she has not been married and then my oldest bi told you an actr and i guess  she is not re married

Recording: (1113/ 9618) 
but she is yelling that everybody is prejudiced against her and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 

Recording: (1114/ 9618) 
no that is not what i mean no i do not i do not mean it that way but i just mean i think i think it is better that if people areare get to a point where they can not work it out i mean i think that that a lot of times you can do things like counceling and those types of things and and maybe there is some way to work it out 

Recording: (1115/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (1116/ 9618) 
u woul be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bugs

Recording: (1119/ 9618) 
uh essentially all the big academics most f thei amit is actually all over the world it is international 

Recording: (1120/ 9618) 
uh once  she was thrug with her pregnancy but she did end up just going to a public school

i have seen the uh big ampa theater and was that that hat what is that the opera house yeah right right on the right on the ways of the ochien or whatever it is gorgeous 

Recording: (1123/ 9618) 
i would say it is not any different than having a man i mean it is a person youo just have a different way of going about it  probably 

Recording: (1124/ 9618) 
yeah and uh i had the prerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money you know but the bad part was is the universiti is trying to do away with civil service civil service is a good thing and a bad thing you know you do you had step raisers and everything so at least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 

Recording: (1125/ 9618) 
yeah  that is it 

Recording: (1126/ 9618) 
well i was uh i was pretty well established about responsibility in that sort of thing before i went into service i was the oldest son and a family of ten 

Recording: (1127/ 9618) 
without going into too much detail um one of my best friends from high school well he stayed at home and i went off to come ombus and i found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrin and theological beliefs and i believed that stuff now and he dos and and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heritic and he just went off to allaska with another friend of ours and before helefht for allaska i  actually took the time to to uh i did not want to but he was sort of pushing me into it because we were iaming each other and uh he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and i told him you know i am like a lot of the stuff that you have talked about h you know talked about not liking i beliefe and i and i told him i aid i can i can understand if in our minds there is a problem but we axcept the fact that the other person is wrong and beleve it at that but that is not what you are thinking you are thinking you ware looking at me and you are knowing within your mind he is evil he is wrong and i said that is not right oc uh i i honestly do not know um people get really scared there is certain i mean like t there ire certain denominations that will take one it is sort of like the outer limits they will take one book or one scripture out of the buible and expanded to christal clarityand they will just run with it and that is what my mom came out of um her her denomination that she came out of she is not part of it any more but denomination she came out of it um some of them ere devout churches within the appostolic christian church we are talking men sit on wone side women sit on the other women weare little thinkhe is on their heads d now jewelry the cerman is read and three different languageshes are really wacky stuff 

Recording: (1128/ 9618) 
ou know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting in any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports 

Recording: (1129/ 9618) 
uum 

Recording: (1130/ 9618) 
no no but he has a daughter and that was from high school um his girlfriend uh got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work things out and they never got married and that was when he lived in canada so she lives in canada now and he goes you know he talks to her all the time and then they are real open about that i mean she is real good about letting the little girl come and she will stay this summer with us and you know he will drive up there and see her too 

Recording: (1131/ 9618) 
like i told you i can be an idiote 

Recording: (1132/ 9618) 
so i you pretty much have to be you know can not be middle class ind no york you have to be ether to be richer or not 

Recording: (1133/ 9618) 
uhum 

Recording: (1134/ 9618) 
no no sh 

Recording: (1135/ 9618) 
no he did not he did not 

Recording: (1136/ 9618) 
nless you get stuck in traffic 

Recording: (1137/ 9618) 
nobody oh she is really playing smart i mean 

Recording: (1138/ 9618) 
umhum yeah um i think they could hav i think shou av get a better education out there uh now i sant lewis chool public schoo to since you probably district you probaby ught to o had the same tn tis here but by being curkwood you know and rather teay smallori h i think we maybe had uh a hundred and some kids in our graduating class you know so uh i felt i get better attention when i wanted it you know uh than i would have had a at a bigger school 

Recording: (1139/ 9618) 
yeah i mean getting a gun does not i mean i was surprised like  i  i have never owned a gun but i am i think it is pretty easy to get one actually 

Recording: (1140/ 9618) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them one and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live ind a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look at like well moyof my friends have to do ands ta wm to do in you know they look at it like it is a big pain because they got a run over to the nurse and get their pill at lnch and generally the long acting the time released ones there is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what i isuppoe to do so they go back to the six hour doasage you know one the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pil and thend their lake to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i gess they are in denyal just like we would be they say what does not help me i do not need at but when you sit down and say okay what are the things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yeah 

Recording: (1141/ 9618) 
i think so yeah like their hair cuts are certain way and can not you have to shave and um you always have to have your tiye and your jacket if you can unless it is really hot there is it is different also depending on the climate 

Recording: (1142/ 9618) 
and that is true uh so that is the most powerful thing i can do when i can turn it over to god and say god it is too dam big for me to handle do you think you can work on maybe helping change this person is heart or ther mind because i can not do that um so you know i did not mean yo i na acanit there 

Recording: (1143/ 9618) 
when i did school levy campaigns uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the viggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the eginning of a a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i do is register parents because many of theme do not vote u and i wread a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i hauld known that when i was in college and work so hard to get tho vote changed to eighteen because i could not vote until i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote fore certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had to wait until i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that you know worked and det some volunteer worke to get that whole thing changed if i would known that they were not going to vote at eighteen and we ere going to wait until they were almost forty i ware n to i wern to wasted my time uh but anyway um ou you get parents who were usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age 

Recording: (1144/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1145/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1146/ 9618) 
and then it is different businesses like white cassle or pisah one of the pisa places and uh some of the super markets and things and they are advertised you know troughout the community so these kids when they have problems they might want to go to huckleberry house and they do not have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a you know a group of volunteers that go out and pick these kids up take them to huckleberry house which is not far from here so i did that for a while but uh was not very uh satisfying because i really did not feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at hucleberry house 

Recording: (1147/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1148/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (1149/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1150/ 9618) 
well i am staying on the whole world a they are and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me i think that maybe he is found it the same way but maybe not as much as i have i thought when i retired it is going to get this done and this done thand this done and i wonder now how i went to work and still got soms done when i got home and i am sure i am doing it just as fast because over and over again people o say i have never seen anybody  wish as much energy you are always doing something but and i think it is just that we do not have the time 

Recording: (1151/ 9618) 
oh sure 

Recording: (1152/ 9618) 
right so they do not come see me and i guess they should not care because i i would just lke them actualy i would lik them tojust come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have that is all we care b i just want to show it off 

Recording: (1153/ 9618) 
yeah it is a lot smaller than collumbus toh 

Recording: (1154/ 9618) 
and  ithink there as an article this last wendsday in the dispach and business section as to how the psel can not regulate it and because that they want tou de regularlate tellacommunications uh and so for the past months we have not been getting telvon bills for usage we had the backbone we are paying for and what is going to happen now this whole thing is hit offers us a a a lot of lato where werth uh we can now uh if we have a contractor let us say over in daton and we are calling from zaines ville office i would rather make a long distance we can go on our pipe and if we have a line going or datn we can make the call as if it is a local call avoiding a all long distance 

Recording: (1155/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1156/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1157/ 9618) 
do you have one now 

Recording: (1158/ 9618) 
kind of balance the brother out a little bit 

Recording: (1159/ 9618) 
um i do not really think there is any huge difference u i can not say from what i have seen the people that went to the catholic schools um they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 

Recording: (1160/ 9618) 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the wekends with my dad and i spent the week with them 

Recording: (1161/ 9618) 
uh lik because there is not like uh like a like a defined lead lead person because e s just one person doing itn most of tnd most of the time i mean like people do have groups that play like technobt or in music but it is not like a lead singer who like you know it is like that it is not like that at all 

Recording: (1162/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1163/ 9618) 
xtremely difficult to deal with 

Recording: (1164/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1165/ 9618) 
oh yeah we have probably been five six times allready and 

Recording: (1166/ 9618) 
talk to them like you know thi o be nice the um um 

Recording: (1167/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1168/ 9618) 
um not really i mean i have been with a few people that have just i mean just randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they did not steal anything they just beat them up for no reason or what not 

Recording: (1169/ 9618) 
yeah i was cutting twenty pounds in three days 

Recording: (1170/ 9618) 
white women who wad actually had it don then uh  then um is pan a ore afferican american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about the governmend i mean at least in that case theyire still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is it is not so much money that it watd ratically change er life in knha sort of you know it is not thousands of dollars it wase two hundred i believe and and that is you know i mean if if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i do not know i think you knw there is the debate about ten years down the line but wh you know is they are going to be something that is going to make themmen chainge you know what is e you know what is hyre going to be in like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i mean ad n know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up there act or anything like that but i meank i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot different than you know the goverenmend saying okay this is your cut off liment but i mean the statistics they were get giving ond um the average number of children that these whomen we are having and you kno you kno the average knumber ofe children that we are just taking to the hospital and left there or you know just dropped off whereever and and the state tha these children were in and their life span and everythingk else i meang you kno there s the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the the child is life you know i meank i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and you know the same is t in england you know everyone sayng oh because they were talking about you know i mean again this was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of you know some how sort of forcing these young girls to lease be on birth control you know in whatever way and and againd that every won was up in arms but it is sort of like you know what is that childis quality of life can be when theyir mothers just you know 

Recording: (1171/ 9618) 
it took us ten years to have and i think my mom generally thought i was doing birth control and we were not but you always knew the suttle oudertone undertones you know is she or is not she it was just like well i am not going to discuss it with her because i knew that that was an ono to her but i was not but she did not evn to know the 

Recording: (1172/ 9618) 
and too much prejudic there really is still in its side but it there really is 

Recording: (1173/ 9618) 
because now they are getting to the age where they are fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know it is 

Recording: (1174/ 9618) 
i know 

Recording: (1175/ 9618) 
in what they would say about americans and american culture like at that discussion group you know in front of you you know so 

Recording: (1176/ 9618) 
one thing uh okay go ahead well uh one thing uh  i was thinking you know that i have a perspective on that maybe lots lots of people do not is how columbus has grown up 

Recording: (1177/ 9618)

Recording: (1235/ 9618) 
no because i think there is the ideal and everything and if you can live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do and i think that is where i was coming from i mean even now um i mean i i could never agree with abortion let us say i i would stand by the church and and most most of the church laws i do stand by but i guess the birth control issue became so personal and um it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with at what i thought was a clear conscience and what i did i do not have any regrets for it what about you 

Recording: (1236/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (1237/ 9618)

Recording: (1239/ 9618) 
umhum umhum right 

Recording: (1240/ 9618) 
hate crime is is a is an intresting term um all crimes all murders are hate related i i am not sure it that is uh it it is difficult i we had civil rihtes laws many people were opposed to those but it was a and an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism u and and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalizet hate but a crime is a crime or you know ae you going to give someone who murdered matheuw shepherd six life terms as opposed to someone who murder someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a a law on the books i do not think we need to have i hate crime over and above that you know the th ththe people who murdered matheuw shepherd should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the u affermative action programs and the bussing did to people is going to turn people against uh gays like that turne people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this wis ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my gol my gol was not to change hearts ind minds my gol was to change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i would lip the see an all white jury convict white men of con oh killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now 

Recording: (1241/ 9618)

um 

Recording: (1254/ 9618) 
yeah there was just something about that sting far better far more than ta paddle paddle was kind of a wop andingen it was ending up with a sting it it kind of got your attention  men you  appeals appeals

Recording: (1259/ 9618) 
yeah i was i was driving by the the hanking and everything so yeah my roommates and i got into a a debate about it but  we did not really resolve it 

Recording: (1260/ 9618) 
and even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child the federal government still consideres them a halfblood 

Recording: (1261/ 9618) 
yes 

Recording: (1262/ 9618) 
um actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i meank i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagin but i mean thew especially they really focused on um not colem bine but the one with they they younger cause in are con uh was ot the yeare before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in comback yeare holding the gun everywhare and columbin you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know the facs we are all over the place btout am ofther kind of issue but um what i think caused it i mean i do no know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the others stoud nts and and you know i am not in any way defending they got is who did it bt um you know something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so mylined or whatever that you know that you would even thenk of doing something like that um i do not kno especially with you know everything that was set about the familiyes and you know they did not seem to of course you knever really know but they didnot seemd to have growing up in this you know terrible environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that um yo know i think a lot more effort needs to be made you know o sort of you know placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked in underpad and you know all those kind of things bu i do not know 

Recording: (1263/ 9618) 
o kay  oh 

Recording: (1264/ 9618)

Recording: (1265/ 9618) 
eighty eight so we j we just had our eleventh wedding aniversary yeah 

Recording: (1266/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (1267/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1268/ 9618) 
yeah i think they are really helpeful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raizing kids can make it there is really but there is so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want ta stay all that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might hav stayed home there is like nine you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that year is care i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know i though 

Recording: (1269/ 9618) 
yeah oh yeah you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with uh it is kind of like the small town thing which u haves goods and bads but i do not know yeah my parents still live there and i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with that still live in town and you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple  years ago and a lot of participation in thatand so 

Recording: (1270/ 9618) 
you can not take that away from him uh e you know like you said i think they just go through a lot of stuff i mean i had a lot of uh anamosity towards my dad things that happened you know uh perhaps not being near when i was you know  younger and stuff like that and u if anything me and my brother got closer because of it you know because he is three years older and be yand hend uh uh but you know now  you know i do not have they they are both ot buth my parents have passed away but uh you know i do not have any  ammosity towards him at all you know i kind ofa it is kind of like a growing up thing i i guess you know i mean you you kind of sat there and say eight  you know you did the best he could you know i mean 

Recording: (1271/ 9618) 
is it often so similar to where i am coming from 

Recording: (1272/ 9618) 
it is a very strong animal and as the old man they got lifted twenty five feet in the aire against the pine tree found out and in my opinion when that stuff happens when i see when i see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out and the bull runs his gord through the person is leg and throws them aroundnd kicks them right near death i do not have any simpathy for thim 

Recording: (1273/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1274/ 9618) 
ou would be lost 

Recording: (1275/ 9618) 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have a family in hawayi we have  family ind virginia beach so 

Recording: (1276/ 9618) 
because i went to origon and of course uh the greater part of the population out there are more socialists than they are capitalists and they are easier to deal with thand they are more reasonable people in my opinion utor reasonable but then i come back to collumbus and all my family and and and all i am the minority ind my family believe me and uh they are very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 

Recording: (1277/ 9618) 
dos not men 

Recording: (1278/ 9618) 
and then a couple of years later he was working on a job in a columbus coated fabrics plant which is plant that makes coated fabrics they make uh thei main thing is ah auto upholstery car upholstery anyway they had big rowlling machines that roled this stuff out and theris fumes came off of it so they had a big hood and exaust system 

Recording: (1279/ 9618) 
i do not know i an i do not know if it was drugs are  something ridiculous  that that a lot of people and i think a lot of the the police force and a lot of other officials are are pretty much an agreement that he should resigne and he feels like like he is just not going to and that we do not have any um that the mayor can not nobody can actually make him resigned that that is something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as you know dorthe was teeter was saying i am going to make him do this which is something that she does not have any power to do um that and and about how how they just continue to get raises and they are and they are not doing very much about it and and less than fifty percent of the police forces actually in police cars and and a lot of people are are doing dust jobs an those types of things and i i guess a lot of people just are not very happy with the job he is been doing 

Recording: (1280/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1281/ 9618) 
well and and the ambiguous part of it you know just sa trying to be protective of the ways 

Recording: (1282/ 9618) 
bye 

Recording: (1283/ 9618) 
because of the gay activism 

Recording: (1284/ 9618)

Recording: (1286/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (1287/ 9618) 
since march too

Recording: (1292/ 9618) 
i have never heard it sad before like you said that that the reason women are not preached is because they do not show any kind of uh spiritual leadership i i have never heard that sad and there must be people who think that 

Recording: (1293/ 9618) 
but that is my plan 

Recording: (1294/ 9618) 
but they just do not have those 

Recording: (1295/ 9618) 
you know a historic building there like  there is no history in america you know

Recording: (1297/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (1298/ 9618) 
h 

Recording: (1299/ 9618)

Recording: (1300/ 9618) 
but if you love the if you love someone you want them to do what  wright and you want hem to learn and if that is the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong you still love them but you are loving other people also and other words you are not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away buith murder but this one over here i am not gong to leti get away with it no i am sorry if my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for i am sorry you have done that deer but and i love you dearly but i tryed to teach you differntly do not know wher you went wrong ando not want i did wrong an what ever but you got to pay the penalty i mean you have to draw the lines somewhere i but now you said family yes i think the reason an that at our age wecan look back every one was born and every one was loved by a father an mothef rea when they were little and how they are formity of years are and the education the um the way they were  uh paught as they were growing up does helped them ty be o n what that presit and is what that polity any politician is anminister or anybody else it  the way you are raised i firmily believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i have done in my life are definitely based on what i saw happen back here you know and i think that it it is it bears on everybody so that is ewy it really begins with the family 

Recording: (1301/ 9618) 
yeah i mean it is just sort of like the whole reputation of you know america just being like the country of excess like excess posessions xcess food excess weight excess moneyyou know everything you know and it is it is you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for about a year and a half and i came back and you know thisis i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere ispecially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and you know where my parents  there were all these you know newstrip malls bilt and stuff and i just felt like i was in you know this like gient camaratland you know i mean it jus was so overwhelming even though obviously i whould growing up with in america my whole life and you know not that i sort of changed completely but you do when you have been away from it and to come back and you knowtisyo go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my frond took me to easten and i mean you walk in there and i do not feel like i am in columbus you know i feel like u it is got to be california or something just because it just

Recording: (1323/ 9618) 
yeah from what i hear actually the like the emery and the um university of chicago you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to harvord and then start you know tryg to make it up by working hard or you get to actual harvard nobody works because they are like we already made it you

but 

Recording: (1348/ 9618) 
uh too tha we never used the word ever  but um i am sure  playin people use the word on us you know but we we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true uh sharing but um in terms of government i do not we were not ready for that because we had more of a matriarky one woman who was decisive and made decisions and we would  gg along withher you know but uh if u if uh we could get ourselves to the place where it would work that would be great and i would eryand i then and the year that i lived in that community was wone of the best years of my life it was 

Recording: (1349/ 9618)

well a long time ago uh when they signe a decoration and everything they said you know build a fence around your place and  and take care of your own you know and and i think basically that is the way the philosophy should be i think there is times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman owh 

Recording: (1359/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1360/ 9618)

Recording: (1362/ 9618) 
i am sorry yes 

Recording: (1363/ 9618)

Recording: (1364/ 9618) 
now this pokim now that is the pokimon you know oh and they are both like i heard somebody somewhere say my five year old can name all hundred and fifty pokimon characters but could not tell you his phone number andh and that is true with mine

Recording: (1368/ 9618) 
that is that is going to be a problem they said bring bring water you are going to definitely like they have no dress cot which is nice so i am just going to wear shorts some good walking shoes and a and a tenshirt because it coul get rough it coul get real rough i bet 

Recording: (1369/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (1370/ 9618) 
yeah well i did not realize that untill i had kids 

Recording: (1371/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (1372/ 9618) 
i mean i am sure at nineteen i was saying some really bisar things too uh but you can tell that he is thought about it 

Recording: (1373/ 9618) 
all right number one none of them had a the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go when wer they wanted when they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car they had their car they were not allowed to have my car and take it and run over to this kid is house woer that kid s 

Recording: (1374/ 9618) 
but when when he first started out i liked him he had on sensible things similar to almost m what we are talking about now i think sometimes but he in order to keep up with uh uh i can not remember all the names o ther shows that i do not watch them but i am do opferiis one of them and all those other people that is just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they have done and all that malarkey and i think he decided he had to do  same thing on his progam ror for him to keep his readings up so you knw ad and see that is what you mean by gitving in to what this person does over here and that is another thing we need to teach your kids because jon do jane do ist doing it does not mean that is right have the curage to be yourself and say no some people ingt think you are terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (1375/ 9618) 
and they they say that is a city and my school or where i grew up was more than double that just over double that it was like sixty thousand 

Recording: (1376/ 9618) 
you know and these schools that have a thousand people i just can not imagine i mean you know my my high school was like four hundred people and we thought that was big at the time and just to have a thousand excuse me people and just to try to moniter different things i mean it is got to be so hard you know and checking everything and 

Recording: (1377/ 9618) 
yeah i live in uh seawerd holle oh yeak uh i think theye are a hundred and seventy of us here or just from my class alone 

Recording: (1378/ 9618) 
and they used to have the lazer lite show down town they they do not have anymore um you know just even if you do one thing free a month 

Recording: (1379/ 9618) 
you know you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you cand work two two hours a day you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids is really not that much a week so 

Recording: (1380/ 9618) 
well i think the people that made that ball should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more thand two years and see how they like it 

Recording: (1381/ 9618) 
and i had to get out uh and other ones it is it is a struggle with that thing and understanding it takes time to understand it a tlot of people a lot of good people are helping me to try nto understand it um i was trying to let the fear of that umthough i am not afraid to die i am afraid sometimes that i will die before i get a chance to do what i feel i was sent here to do which is just the basic things fall in love with somebody have children raise them 

Recording: (1382/ 9618) 
uhhuh me too years ago 

Recording: (1383/ 9618) 
and my but now my daughter is my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college and uh i think that they are they one of them particularly is i think in good moral coold sort of a guy and the other one i do not feel like i know as well but i i really think that they are both good and uh see 

Recording: (1384/ 9618) 
well i work i workd part time kind of because uh i worked full time when he was you know one and i did not uh i felt like um the babysitters or you know whoever saw him more than i did and that  because id love my son more than anything in the world and i felt like he needed me you know so i went down a part time i am struggling more but i  rather see my son have me you know 

Recording: (1385/ 9618) 
umhum i moved just h just moved into uh up oer one sixty one cleveland area uh i lived up hereyou por years but i just moved back up there and uh whay i left it was because of the the city the traffic and everything where you get around campus you know it is a lot i thany saw a hussl husl hussle but down here even with with the kids and everything going to school but basically itf kind of laid back uh mhore up there it is all gogo go uh 

Recording: (1386/ 9618) 
well it is harder than i think in in some ways than people think um i went to the tich ohio fair last year to look around and did not did not see that much interest in in uh chemistry or general cience teachers u i think the market is it is fluctuated back to a point where they do not need as many right now they are not clammering for us mhum 

Recording: (1387/ 9618) 
is it really 

Recording: (1388/ 9618) 
i think people are still fairly raceist i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other race relations fault u i mean as far as like if yoe lok t  the black communite things like that yeuahave like bet um yoeah af like the united negrow college fund things like that where they are almost segreagating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in the way that is almost segragating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or what not um and i think it is sort of going along the same lines where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1389/ 9618) 
here that nice mal is and um some in smerna which is outside of atlanta but girls that i met through school and stuff 

Recording: (1390/ 9618) 
but yeah that leaves he door open for who to get in trouble 

Recording: (1391/ 9618) 
i mean i am sure there is some but it is not as extreme as some places that i have been 

Recording: (1392/ 9618) 
i think later on when he gets a little older he will be you know 

Recording: (1393/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1394/ 9618) 
twod you do 

Recording: (1395/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (1396/ 9618) 
it is not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway it is that um the homes are worth more because of the school system 

Recording: (1397/ 9618) 
definitely definitely 

Recording: (1398/ 9618) 
oh it has you know your basic uh lazeris which i like to go to laserus and seers and jac pennis and uh no i would not want to drive to puleris to go to those stores but if they made some outlets over there you know  i would be happy with that uh there is just a lot of smaller stores you know like victorious secrets and book stores and toy stores and athletic ware stores um a lot of those i do not even go to get some kios set up outside you know with  the little carts with different little things they sell just like you ar basic kind of mal 

Recording: (1399/ 9618)

Recording: (1409/ 9618) 
umhum i read it 

Recording: (1410/ 9618) 
yeah it is going to have to be from the bottom up i think and everybody keeps and i i am just getting a kick out of all the advertsements and everything nd they are coming with two thousand on it well i am hoping people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but i am hoping that it does mean since people are so focused on it does mean a shift ing consciousness i hope uh why tkay i do not know what that really stands for i o think itv some words there but you know since everybody is just making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal yeah 

Recording: (1411/ 9618) 
when i got here but i was in one of those you know outh stupid uh pychopathic relationships shall we say and i kind of needed to to disappear and um we never told him where she she had just moved

Recording: (1419/ 9618) 
and i have heard the thing you know you are not my real fither and all that we went through all that

Recording: (1427/ 9618) 
well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body thit should be in the body way up here in the n most people get ahead of themselves 

Recording: (1428/ 9618) 
oh yeah it as like wo my ed was like oh i got to figure out how to do that look like you can not do that  i flipped out yeah he he broke into like oh my god can not remember what it was but he had all these numbers for credit cards and he was threatening to  sell them on the internet

yeah i am a democrat i have never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in arigan and i always dored marcap fild i did not vote for ethere was a erate because i thought he was a great republian hh  but i think uh personally mye colman was good i ihave me uh well m we had a diamond jubuli at the village and and colman and teter both came ind ney bo i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i did not think that be there was much that much difference in them ida loggically i think you know she would do wld just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but uh i in terms of having a black meer i think that is good for columbus i thin 

Recording: (1431/ 9618) 
ummhum enjoy them now you get the terrible teeve to go through which is which is cool and uh i remember one time  we get in a big argument one time when she uh when she turned teen teenager and uh mik called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and i sat there and said well you knw i am calling a long distance she goes so i am talking to my girl friend and e said so wha wl hang up on her and call her back

uum 

Recording: (1435/ 9618)

like big deal you know common sense hot you do not put it in a sensitive area whyle you are driving to work um but she sued for ten million and the papers said she won ten million she did not i mean after that ten million award was given by a jury then heh mcdonald is allowed a an appeal after the end of a year so she does not see any money for a year and that is if they do not appeal but ninety percent of these big corporations out of the money behind them they have lawyers behind them so they can sue for an appeal 

Recording: (1437/ 9618) 
i was uh professor uh it was itis is interesting i mean it is it is it is a lot of it is also remember a lot of terminology but i enjoyed it

typical dorm room 

Recording: (1439/ 9618) 
nthat is probably when he started yeah 

Recording: (1440/ 9618) 
yeah um yeah i it is hard because i i do come i am a christian so i believe that homele sexuality is wrong but i do not like i said i am not going to condem them um at all lik u  said i have friends it i understand what you are saying u but i think that is something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out  maybe that child um it is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporated in a thirty student onsambo um i it would be nice if we had more of an open environment schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem ind talked to them about it and then send them on that counseling went on one way um just because if you are going to teach it to a a large amount of student i am not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest i we would probably be making cracks and just make them feel more do you know what i mean so i do not 

Recording: (1441/ 9618) 
at is pretty cood 

Recording: (1442/ 9618) 
algore really does not entice me at all he claims you invented the inner net 

Recording: (1443/ 9618) 
um i sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun they will get a gun it does not matter what they do to try to make it so people can not get their hands on guns they are basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them 

Recording: (1444/ 9618)

Recording: (1460/ 9618) 
u 

Recording: (1461/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (1462/ 9618) 
so that is you know they a lot of my decisions were based uon that 

Recording: (1463/ 9618) 
um but you know i think what they did was fairly good they did not really as far as i remember at that point at least they did not well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue um but i i what i remember was more of a cientific approach 

Recording: (1464/ 9618) 
for amcs for um not getting hurt  she works at phedex and um her crew is always getting hurt mainly her 

Recording: (1465/ 9618) 
first area second qorter 

Recording: (1466/ 9618) 
no no but hopefully when they do get the one strike somebody i say somebody because i right now i do not really think we have that n plase but we would need more of a um wone strike stepping stone you kno and i let us face it counsciling is probably not going to work uh and somebody and that it would almost take um i do personally no people that go into that type of environment here in columbase and actually work with the familyes and work with the kids and actually are in there living there showing them you know it is it is one thing to go help them and then leave that and go home to your nice house i do not and i admit it i could not do it but um if if people really did things like that i think they woul be helpd for thum because they are actually frends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out those type of people i think might be able to reach them i will not be able to reach them probably just because what do i know about it um i am yeah i agree i do not think it would be a deterrent at all annitually but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realize the backgrond and tried to get them out of that hopefully even if you save haf of them it is better than than anything 

Recording: (1467/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (1468/ 9618) 
umhuh 

Recording: (1469/ 9618)

Recording: (1472/ 9618) 
no not often uh my daughter has a very um intense life  and uh so uh i do not see them near as often as i like well i we just do a one day thing because it is fairly easy to drive to tolido so i go real early in the morning and uh spend six or seven hours with them and then come back and or she does the same thing she comes down here and we just do the one tha day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and bolbababu you know so it is betto just to om so i know what they are doing and everything but i do not i am not the old fashioned grandmother 

Recording: (1473/ 9618) 
i guess 

Recording: (1474/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1475/ 9618) 
it is and plus the thing youis to f like when we bought our house we had looked for uh months and months and months and i wanted an old house it was built like nineteen seventeen i wanted an old house that had not been kept up 

Recording: (1476/ 9618) 
yeah it they not goingto change thoug 

Recording: (1477/ 9618) 
um they did briefly like cover things like that with like religion and health classes things like that 

Recording: (1478/ 9618) 
it is been i it is been rremarcably well i mean i have not had any problems i found out pret he early which was kind of strange in about four weeks and i went in and and i had a check up and my doctor  he thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an altra sownd well the thing is they did this altra show and they did not find anything so which was really kind of creapy because they did not know because there is that whole tubile pregnancy thing and all this stuff and and the guy that did my altra shw an was not my regular doctor and he is kind of little he he is just a little abrupt for me and he says well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you d die and all this t uf an i e wai of it  i d not you kw  d ount ready for this but after after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that it is gone really well i mean i just i and i know we just finished our lamas class es last night and there are some women in there they are huge i mean these girls can not even get off the floor and i just feel really back them so for me it is it is gone very very well i mean i have not really had any problems 

Recording: (1479/ 9618) 
i think my daughter genipher is very active um not so much uh the type of work that i do but i think she is very cheritable very giving very uh 

Recording: (1480/ 9618) 
well i do think axcess is too easy but it is sort of like anything else i think if laws were passed the people who were against it would be so you know just beside themselves that it would i do not know for how long but i think it would make the situation not with the shootings and things like that but i think it would make the just the gun situation probably much worse for a while becis people would be you know doing illegal thingst to get guns and that sort of thing but i mean too many people have guns here there is too much of a in my opinion you know there is too much of a gun culture i mean over there they have pretty much outlawed guns axept for hunting and things and the fact that you know of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much seccessfully do that obviously angone such a small country in comparison but i mean that is just amazing to me and but it is true i mean the fact that you know the access is just there is almost nothing bared and i mean just the amoun of people that i just here sort of you know in conversetion talking about oh yea i you know getting a gun for security and all thi it is like you know  your chances of number one needing it and number to if you were in that just minute percentage of you know happen chans that you would need it the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who was not you know i mean everything is against you 

Recording: (1481/ 9618) 
why i do not know it does not make sense 

Recording: (1482/ 9618) 
oh it wis on saturday 

Recording: (1483/ 9618) 
well you know my and my girls there are certain products that brand name like uh one of them i know is the mier uh pudding that you can uh take to for lunches which they do and it is like edventure you know adventure butt edten well every once a while hunts will be the same price an they will be a cupon in the paper so joice will oh sh owys  we we trade she goes thegrosery store once then next two week is i go and then next two wek she goes so uh she will you know she will buy stuff like that with a cuponand she goes and i go why are you buying that she goes it was cheaper than the mire brand and then when we eat it it is like it is too sweet you know or it is too overpowering or too shugary and the girls seeme to thinkt sameway that we go we do not like this it is too choccolaty so you know like the man which stuff it is like they just pour sugar in it i guess because that is what people like and so i find that the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but it is all like a mire brand or something like that or food club or something like that 

Recording: (1484/ 9618) 
but it is a would you say it is a say it is a nice place to visit but you would not want to live there or would you actually live there

Recording: (1486/ 9618) 
i do not know i would like to think i would like to say no sitting here but you never know becauseu i guess that is because that is what happens to a lot of them mean they they come out of chool all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they are molded and assuming they make opper management there is you want the tax break you want thing you know what i mean and then they like i have an uncle he is a vice president on wallstreet for marlinch and he said you know he got out of school n he is very idealistic but now he he is he is like all those people they should you know i i made it through myself and the is not for like thuh you know but realistically he did not but

when i first you know got a divorce so it is been hard 

Recording: (1496/ 9618)

Recording: (1497/ 9618)

oh it will be 

Recording: (1504/ 9618) 
no because uh all the kids take that california california atchievement test on if you ar familiar with that and it is like you know because it is say like you and i i go to school you go to you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in collumbus and we both make straight days well when you take the california achievement tests that really tha aids mea nothing because it is like let us see what you understand and have learned thi schoor on that is what really matters to me and both my daughters have really schored exceptionally high on those because you know they always pick on columbus cpublic schoos tey go oh it is o look t all batd ther tes schors well you know if you take say like uh the worst school in town which i do not know what it wout would be but let is just say it is uh brown school well you have children there who have not seen dad and probably ten years and mom is basically sometimes there orian crison so they live with grandma how do you expect them to do well nobody is there to you know i am not a uh you know i an oager anything but you know i always keep tabs on my kids you know like i have always gone to conferences even though they got straight azs i go to conferences and teachers go what do you come for and i go if i do not come then it is like sayingh i do not really care so i always go so they know that i am keep ing tabs on things and i do not demand azs i just demand them to do their best and i said you know if your best is to see then that is what it will be but i said if you are best is an ad ou r getting to see you get me to talk to so uh back to the brown school uh there are kids like my daughter there who make straight azs and when they take the um what is that thing the proficiency testsome through it and get like outstanding on it and uh then you have h the this probably sounds really buiast or big et but then you have the kid who is mom and dad are not together and and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes the proficioenc test he gets like a 

Recording: (1505/ 9618) 
like i had my kids last week i had them all righte how to make a peanout butter and jelly sandwich and then i had them one by one come up to the table and the front they did not know i was going to do this so after they get all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and mi bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelley and i sit them down beside me and i go okay now no adlibbing no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote

Recording: (1510/ 9618) 
i mean my my kids went to a school that when my son had already left it but in the fourth grade they announced took all the kids in to the auditoriam and said we are closing next year and it was hard but yeakh once it is reached the point that is decision is made and announced and i mean there were good reasons for it uh and they explaind the reasons and you know at some point you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when it is inevitable 

Recording: (1511/ 9618) 
the mustyness the old 

Recording: (1512/ 9618) 
every kid and my kid ran around with i knew his parents one way or the other

you do not have too many options you know 

Recording: (1514/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1515/ 9618) 
because the larger story was two large to film in one one movie but this one as a as a as a part of a whole i i am reserving complete judgment until 

Recording: (1516/ 9618) 
oh okay 

Recording: (1517/ 9618) 
as uh uh a lot of mothers do but she was there and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something she was there and uh yeah i think that uh that probably had something to do with it and the fact that our kids knew what her moral beliefs were 

Recording: (1518/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1519/ 9618) 
yeshe is alrey i do not think she would have it any other way

yeah meet different people

even if they do not pay me it still be e 

Recording: (1523/ 9618) 
isa you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 

Recording: (1524/ 9618) 
yeah it is like um i do not know they used to have something called exploring posts that were directly related and then um venturing kind of took over for that like in still in boy scouts and then exploring went off on its own and as a result they took religion out of the program and they put they allow like homosexuality with theh leaders and all that so it is i do not know wht we call it like heppy boy scouts 

Recording: (1525/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (1526/ 9618) 
and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid s goingta hate you 

Recording: (1527/ 9618) 
we had uh counter battery fire we called it which when they were shooting back at us once in north africa was kind of scarry uh we were in position where we could fire on a a uh tank battle that was going onn we had a fo forward observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing and so he was adjusting fire and i do not know how many tanks they claimed that we hit but 

Recording: (1528/ 9618) 
and so it was kind of funny but but the discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that do not have any hope and 

Recording: (1529/ 9618)

Recording: (1638/ 9618)

Recording: (1639/ 9618) 
i do not like busi i just do not um i think it is it is kind of like you get what you pay for 

Recording: (1640/ 9618) 
yeah but um just to see the church might be fun um we about how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build a new worchip center building and because we were really too too big for the sanctuary that we had 

Recording: (1641/ 9618) 
hum 

Recording: (1642/ 9618) 
ell yeah me either 

Recording: (1643/ 9618) 
so that is all the required i am thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it

enough to satisfy me so that was good 

Recording: (1645/ 9618) 
uum 

Recording: (1646/ 9618) 
that would not bother me at all 

Recording: (1647/ 9618)

so i spent the best six months in my lifee 

Recording: (1649/ 9618) 
umhum yeah i yoea knoh like i said i do not know i i just i got to make some decisions here you know and i i do not want to put too much pressure on it you know one of the elders told me he you know cut yourself some slack and just relax for a while you know because i worked at a movie theater for a year and you know i got hassled and about my hair you know yah told me the only thing keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of ciszers 

Recording: (1650/ 9618) 
seen all the nice things just  everywhere i could not believe it but now it is it is easy to take it for granted again just when i am back home 

Recording: (1651/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (1652/ 9618) 
oh you have it is like mean i well after i heard that i said we it is notyog forth going i has they are gon to be rud 

Recording: (1653/ 9618) 
well i think at that age the parents should be involved and hopefully they will be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she is goingto hae the rest of her life um  i will tell you what with today is world and some of these fourteen year olds thatt look like they are twenty and you know they they know what they are doing and know they should not keep repeating that um i just think the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option i really do but yes the parents should be involved i would say to the age seventeen maybe you know i think they should have a parents concent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it is going to be if she is going to be a young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother you know i mean there is a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just they kill them you know there is so much of that for a while they are that was going on and it is like you i can not believe these women are doing this you know they justt snap 

Recording: (1654/ 9618) 
buti i i had a note in before i had the hard attack i would already had two hard attacks i had a note init i needed to be on the first shift or i would probably have another hard attack and they would not not put me on for a shift then i had to another hard attack put me in the hospital a then i had a another hard attack when i was in the hospital and when i came out that is when i gave them another note state and i needed to really be on first shift 

Recording: (1655/ 9618)

than would be with the black president and i think it would cause problems um i do not know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it but i definitely could see definitely would think that people would be arguing about it yelling about it and making a bigger deal about it 

Recording: (1796/ 9618) 
is that right 

Recording: (1797/ 9618) 
well because i have been in public schools all my life and i should be first to know that there is ah lot of favoritism you know some some teachers will teach one but not teach the other

you know and i just thought i just do not i just do not like this is nots is thist something that when i look along terms of something that i want to do what for the rest of my life ind on i know it just does not you know and i think that you have to look at and see if you are compatible with somebody before you know people get into situations whand they marry people that you just you from the outside you can look and you can think are your not you know that is never going to wear you know so i think that you just kind tof have to take into consideration you know are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that is going to that is going to work and be positive yeah i do n i am kni do not kno to kno anything yt 

Recording: (1825/ 9618)

and they were in itally and europe and uh there was not the definate enemy in vitnam that there was in europe i think that is part of it and of course the attitude of moshto the guys that went to vinnam was a little bit different from from awas probably as a consequence of our understanding of the the uh 

Recording: (1980/ 9618) 
ll maybe it is crime is going down in the sense that is applying you know it is criminals are not as active but there is more and more these acts of violence and maybe it is because they are so dramatic that you notice it 

Recording: (1981/ 9618) 
not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so inclined to like push their athletes to cut weight

Recording: (1989/ 9618) 
hum 

Recording: (1990/ 9618) 
but it and it is it is parents that fight for the society and what is in your community you know the parents for each intiovgidual child they have to all form together as a group and almost be oh parents to all these kids as a group you know it is not you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it acts ass as the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents they do not even aware they are you know it is the kids  responsibility to get in go to school you know maybe the mom and dad did not even come home the night before but you know i mean there is all different kinds of situations so i think it does start with the parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being uh shown and and have access to 

Recording: (1991/ 9618) 
oh yes 

Recording: (1992/ 9618)

Recording: (1996/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (1997/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (1998/ 9618) 
yeah yeah they they all all of them there is actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look sob its you saiy there is little details that are different and 

Recording: (1999/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (2000/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (2001/ 9618) 
i would say of uh i think the the the vva generally sees on the average five seven ten something like that a day ar not all of them homeless 

Recording: (2002/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2003/ 9618) 
um i think i think that there should be a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory uh sexual herassment tapes and and you learn you teach the girls that it is not what they do it is how they make you feel as is constituted as your uh uh herassment there and they are too afraid and then besides that they you know there is crushes on you know you can not falt the girls for having crushes and things like that they are going through enough things as it is 

Recording: (2004/ 9618)

Recording: (2005/ 9618) 
oh that is neice 

Recording: (2006/ 9618) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (2007/ 9618) 
yes it is definitely have an effect on uh children and uh uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they are not doing it yet whether they will be able to pick up enough uh by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i do not know but uh i am glad my children went to school when they did  and i stayed home with them 

Recording: (2008/ 9618)

Recording: (2012/ 9618) 
somewhat 

Recording: (2013/ 9618) 
yw 

Recording: (2014/ 9618) 
ison right 

Recording: (2015/ 9618) 
yea 

Recording: (2016/ 9618) 
what his background really was 

Recording: (2017/ 9618) 
umhum yeah i graduate from athinis high school uh androled in uh ou for uh the winter quarter and porceeded a part of that out and and at the time 

Recording: (2018/ 9618) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could af easually quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a commis public school and it they did not care i mean i i went through elementary and middal school with straight as and bes and got there and i was on ces todis you know and i just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learned you learned if you do not you do not if you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i do not there i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middale school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (2019/ 9618) 
here are not as many of them or you mean because 

Recording: (2020/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (2021/ 9618) 
and she is taken very good care of herself she is followed all the doctoris uh orders and she is very careful what she eats and 

Recording: (2022/ 9618) 
umo 

Recording: (2023/ 9618) 
uh i live up north uh around carrol and uh mors road 

Recording: (2024/ 9618) 
ye 

Recording: (2025/ 9618) 
but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean numberone they are around their parents and their ciblings and that is socialization you go to church ore to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that the have read andseen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peer is opinions bbecause i i for one example the pokimound cras my son did not know what pokiymon woas and tell he heard some otheir kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid iis pushing it ind their fathe you know and then even still they are just like oh ways cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean  you know what i mean because it is like they they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about i oh he must be cool because some other kids e are talking about it but then hee icided that it was ot cool so at was my influ our influence on him rather than the peer is influence on him 

Recording: (2026/ 9618) 
it is grace breatheren christian middle school it is part of worthington schools because they anexed it 

Recording: (2027/ 9618)

Recording: (2029/ 9618) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (2030/ 9618) 
um i do not know you know 

Recording: (2031/ 9618) 
he seemed to confuse parenting with controlling 

Recording: (2032/ 9618) 
so iam not going to get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (2033/ 9618) 
i think it is important to know what the persons values and customs are and to support whatever it is and if i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed to bace tennor star or they needed to have this thing above the bettere under the bed and i mean if it is important for them to have prayer then i think it is important to get the upperprick people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (2034/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (2035/ 9618) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like where they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have was take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up ind i do not know what i grew up in but i will i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody that goes hunting and fishing and drives tracks and wears ball caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know culture is all different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or you kno not o mean that that is something different um except the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (2036/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2037/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (2038/ 9618)

Recording: (2058/ 9618) 
i have that is certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain does not work thin th ways thatother peoples do so i think i think a lot of it too has to to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing you know i mean i have gotten so much better over the years i was very i have always been real lot more temporamental we always joke you know that that predictable and some of those things arre not uh even temperaed ore not things you would use to describe me ni bot but but not in a negative negative way you know i just think that as i have got ten allor too i have been able to see things and not be so get so concerned about things that that really were not that important anymore

Recording: (2102/ 9618) 
we we do not necessarily overcome ed by bed we are still very much in that framework of efforts in this on this particular plann

Recording: (2181/ 9618) 
yeah well there was not even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say t thits just there wis nothing thare but there w is no ability communicate there was u he needs to know this piece of information d at the same time but there is no way i could tell it to him so yeah it is like so so iam yeah you do not know and there is nothing else to do about it and continue on marily and he i he said eventually he said it was some time later when i actually found out as going on i said i had some suspicions because you can do a quick party accountn an figure out who is not there and it seemed something bad has happened but um but he said but it was a while before ifound oopu actually so so we can stop we can stop the story herend we can go on because is the story u it is a fun story but

no i got them 

Recording: (2450/ 9618) 
think about things i mean it is pretty easy to do 

Recording: (2451/ 9618) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through som sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of beging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is a really easy life 

Recording: (2452/ 9618) 
yeah h about four or five years it is not that bad uh how old oh that is very young yeah you do not want another one yout you t at least  you know dyperis out of the way before you go to the next one

think the point is they are on drugs you know and i do not yeah i am not i do not consider myself races at all it is unfortunate that that is what is happening but it is just one of those things i you hate to say yeah i am for it because you sound like it is like everything is specific and permanent yeah i kind of have a problem with that um because they might change their mind but then again they can always adopt you know and i kind of look at it that way there is enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (2454/ 9618) 
gosh you know that is one of the things that i have really you know when i read the paper i think wol what can you do it has to start there first you know and i think if um and i and thi might be because i am a woman but i think if women started running things it would be a lot different than when men run things because men tend to think you know like the government and that kind of thing those kind of um funds that are available for different organizations tat they are all geared toward things that essentially helpe them as a whole or help u well yeah but i mean not so much that um it is always been the women is responsibility to be responsible for the kids or to care about their welbeing and the a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing men are more that is go get it and you know wey need more money and you know they 

Recording: (2455/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2456/ 9618) 
i am sure i am sure it is you know it is just the circles i move in 

Recording: (2457/ 9618) 
umhum oh yeah you you know well you can see it here i mean you can u see some nineteen year ol or eighteen year old uh guy or girol or wha ever you knoow an see a difference in u maturity you know f of a another couple of three different people and everything uh i do not know whether  me coming from like a rural area you know athens and everything uh i think it maybe hase something to do with that even just a day you know you are more uh family oriented uh uh your your friends are basically you know you counot them on your hands which you still can but uh but you socialize a lot more if you are in the city with more people aneverytihg where if you come from like a smaller town you tend to socialize with a certain people you know group or or whatever you know 

Recording: (2458/ 9618) 
uh i got thrown out of high school 

Recording: (2459/ 9618)

betgers i love it 

Recording: (2463/ 9618) 
it ai nt my job i am doing her work she ainot 

Recording: (2464/ 9618) 
i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy togethere only thing that is going to happen is it is going to chouckle down and you are going to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is misearable and they fight and then you feel like it isyou you know people sayit s my fault because hitis happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not know that is a totally different perspective just to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 

Recording: (2465/ 9618) 
ye 

Recording: (2466/ 9618) 
like while she was studying or something i think we played this homer symson sogshe got she got so mad it was so worth it 

Recording: (2467/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2468/ 9618) 
it it might uh it might um i was oing to say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campains i have seen and recent years youtilizing college ates students has been clinton is campaign voth times uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase um his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign and a i belive that was ninety two did a really super job of organizing college students ecause that is when you are at you ar most um w when you believe in things and you are at you are most idealistic and you would think thatyou know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and as an under curent it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talked to people uh and you have to be carefolr where you do this because abortion is and at very dhevice of issu in this country and i think it does mobilize people but ilt also devides them you know  definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that woar to vite at people um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it wase the difference between protecting rob verse is weight and not and in protecting choice you know  um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gor campaign the re i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunida to a point two to three supreme court justices and af that if you wane to protect that rihte ou got to vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clintan that way both e ninety two an again in fhor you are lae ninety six uh and i think that is going na happen again uh because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here b very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that is you are rady i know which one will protect the right for choice uh and um u i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidaa over candidate be because they will protect tabortion rightes thatgoing to thevide the country and not keep us together 

Recording: (2469/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2470/ 9618) 
umu 

Recording: (2471/ 9618)

n you some really wackye 

Recording: (2502/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2503/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (2504/ 9618) 
bi 

Recording: (2505/ 9618) 
obviously it is not something new that is been coming around i mean it is i have been around for a long time 

Recording: (2506/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2507/ 9618) 
yeah  well  what my opinion on our whole penial system is just you know well it goes along we are notwe are kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now and we are definitely neglecting criminals they need to have be educated and and worked with i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they have uh learned incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh they need to have pychological help period 

Recording: (2508/ 9618) 
but it dis not bother me uh religion is basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties u you myouou know everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either cathlic or something like that but uh nowadays you know you have the uh uh more outspokennes on moslihing muslims and e u islam and uh jud i in judiism andd everyhing soh and n there again i do not have a problem with that you know because you you got toh meat yourself you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know if you believe in religion you your here temporarily pre turn orte later on you know 

Recording: (2509/ 9618) 
who is been real helpful you know with uh uh being a support n you know myaparents are very supportive but you know it was just sickening the i when i sat down there and they just you know the biddings started at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars and my attornay looked at hm and said already if o can not i said this guy had his head split open and it was your negligence so you know wewill we will take that as an insult

Recording: (2512/ 9618) 
um because he he likes he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and i smack his hands for that and i try not to yeall but it is hard not to yell i try to talk to him

yeah and just ta couple of things i remember when i first started going to the unitarian church up here on uh well when i was a and sunday school we we drove there from renalsburg  by going up i think renalds burg new albany road up to uh morcs road and then over on mors road to high street so it was it was on the back roads you know  and that was before the mid sixties when the freeway was built i seventy was buildlt through town and a lot of a lot of times you do not realize what kind of havic that creeis when a freeway is built through the biddle of a town because you have to take out a lot of houses to do that and you can sort of realize that if you ever go around the area and go to one of the little side streets that ded ends because the freewayis there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been twenty or threty houses that they had to take out here 

Recording: (2543/ 9618) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you are  i mean kids like that i could see if they were ina poor in harlom or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood and a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their childrenr their son was doing 

Recording: (2544/ 9618) 
yep 

Recording: (2545/ 9618) 
so it is not uh there was a man named sunber who was uh recruiting women you know and telling them they had to sweat naked 

Recording: (2546/ 9618) 
i mean i could practically graduate already i have all the credits but then you have those required classes that you have to take 

Recording: (2547/ 9618) 
i do not say that of all of the kids because i know that some of them were brought up right 

Recording: (2548/ 9618) 
you know my older sister wis a different case she is a little batter but it it is you know as long as you have a good parent it you know i think that is really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father she she did very well 

Recording: (2549/ 9618)

Recording: (2562/ 9618) 
a you told me not to lose that so i a trying to stick to that isl right um 

Recording: (2563/ 9618) 
yeah and and the problem is the problem is seeing things in other people i mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes arein the mirror to the sol at is very true you know i could see in certain people is eyes when i was in the hospital the confusion the unsure feelings you know the uh i do not know  just something i could see there that i can not explain and i still can not explain it i just know what i see and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrists wher they want to put me on some kind of anti hellusion e geni medication and i said well thi is a man you know i am not hellucinating 

Recording: (2564/ 9618) 
yeah is ik keep it was not but then a moves well there we go 

Recording: (2565/ 9618) 
right right 

Recording: (2566/ 9618) 
by the eighth grade they are sixt and seventh gradeers pretty much know everything and you are the stupid one but by the time they get the eighth grade they are goingthbsteaerdt to u 

Recording: (2567/ 9618) 
well i think uh han my opinion i think main mainly the uh  it is the absence of uh basically parenting you know uh my mom was there u she was a housewife you knoh and uh so she was she went to work after i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother and all my brothers and sisters are already graduated you know so 

Recording: (2568/ 9618) 
she went to my school she just barely works at all apparently 

Recording: (2569/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2570/ 9618) 
not realy u just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (2571/ 9618) 
you know you have to be a good example i mean if you if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself andyou stay positive and do the right things and think that is the best you can do for 

Recording: (2572/ 9618) 
so he gives them a drug called well butrin which is ah you know like an nide pressat type thing that they said works for uh eigd chd but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study 

Recording: (2573/ 9618) 
i am during different points of the day i kno 

Recording: (2574/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2575/ 9618) 
but it made a lot of people more rare 

Recording: (2576/ 9618) 
well i think they need to do away with tha lot of the foster homes uh you know a lot of the you know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and uh you know maybe pool these kids uh into more of a group setting or something and give them more um you know counselling uh professional you know counseling i is ji uh you know i i did not have good experiences with foster homes and and i know uh a lot of kids you know that are saying that i think that the parents have too many rihts you know in the corts and there is just a lot going on you know that uhit is not going to get better it is going to get worse you know with the way families are torn appart now and uh you know mothers have to work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that uhyou know perfect mom you know so there is just a lot going on u that needs to be restructured so 

Recording: (2577/ 9618) 
these 

Recording: (2578/ 9618) 
i mean obviously if someone is like thirty and they are gay i do not see them as being too onting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 

Recording: (2579/ 9618) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio ind uh twenty or twenty five years or something like that and he hould killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a cop out if there ever was one just to give him a leathal injection and let him go he should hav rotted in prison for no that is not a punishment he was off his rocker there is not anybody who murders who is not insaine 

Recording: (2580/ 9618) 
hen they had t you know they went through their own training and everythingn we did not iner pace with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one walking or marching somewhere but as far as praternizing you were not allowed to 

Recording: (2581/ 9618) 
it is so corrupt they have two choices to stay in it and try or to succume to all the things and ninety percent of them as you can see what happens in washington have succumed you know there is i do not i do not hear any of them rais an hell about what really matters in this country 

Recording: (2582/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (2583/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2584/ 9618) 
um i do not really know honestly i mean it is definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to them 

Recording: (2585/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2586/ 9618) 
it is a little hard to accept uh you know an i its it is hard to know what he is going through how much of it is uh normal teenage rebellion and how much of it is just 

Recording: (2587/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2588/ 9618) 
well yeap when he was i do not remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been kilic or whatever but he just cried and yep 

Recording: (2589/ 9618)

and then remember back on it 

Recording: (2596/ 9618) 
like or but i do not know it wis real weird i 

Recording: (2597/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2598/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (2599/ 9618) 
well i i think that my opinion is that if you e not going to school and you are not going you are not working and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know and a lot of kids that is all they really want to do now adays is just cause aggravation of people 

Recording: (2600/ 9618) 
to the hub uh which of course eliminated downtime but with uh that we were not in a position to monitor traffic 

Recording: (2601/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (2602/ 9618) 
and i think um ofof course we all hope that debortion would not be that that nobody would have an abbortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think  you know i ea i mean yeah there should not be there should not should not spend six weeks on abortion oor six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing in health class maybe and thend and then there ought toyo it ought to be it it should be known that you can go to your counseler 

Recording: (2603/ 9618) 
an i sit theren go you know i tell p fy you lit the ba clinic and everything they got a homeless thing uh over there and i say you know this guy a friend i know you know he is a bein i bet the guys need to get out toimand help him you know i mean you are in more of a uh situation than i am to be able to go out and and an si terim but he wants me take him like marry haven or something like that and he is been there before and all he does is tay te hy sovers up and goes back out 

Recording: (2604/ 9618) 
of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty 

Recording: (2605/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (2606/ 9618) 
dn jo turtle all the well the kids went un to that just so intensively and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean wht uh the visiual was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks and hoods and 

Recording: (2607/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (2608/ 9618) 
kindof you know we know but it is 

Recording: (2609/ 9618) 
that would be great  i would do it definitely 

Recording: (2610/ 9618) 
if you got a car it is easy to get there yeah but if you if you are rigt in ta buff it sometimes uh takes a couple f hours 

Recording: (2611/ 9618) 
in some ways i like it and some ways it is not my favorite place but it seems like it is relatively safe place to live although that is coming for me i have been robed at gun point or nife point about four times i think in collumbus yeah maybe five um i drove a taxy cab for a couple of summers and i was wrobed think twice driving the cab and part of it was just being stupid but it was down around mounta vernon area and uh i got very little money but i was not hurt 

Recording: (2612/ 9618) 
on tv and in the movies 

Recording: (2613/ 9618) 
i love columbus actually um when i left i was fed up with columbus and but like anything you know after being away for a while and not really you know being i mean i have soriends there and everything but you know i missed my friends and i missed really sort of you know knowing everything in a city because london is never going to be like that for me you know and it is just a totally diferent experience and you know i did miss columbus and i am ind i am glad to be back although know i miss london so 

Recording: (2614/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (2615/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2616/ 9618) 
they tried sampling well my brother ritch was one of the families they sampled 

Recording: (2617/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2618/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2619/ 9618) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so as arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age an they sort of give background on him and that is what every one bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the meedia is only showing one start of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on than they are telling you um so i really do not see a big problem with the way the america is going or whatever the youth um and like  i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (2620/ 9618) 
yeah th we did not really get the the video tape they gave us was half impamercials and then  things like things like how to clean the ambilical i mean stuff like that but you you as far as actual parenting things went there was really nothing 

Recording: (2621/ 9618) 
yeah hi actually is is his dad is mother babysits 

Recording: (2622/ 9618) 
umum 

Recording: (2623/ 9618) 
but the professors seemore cenar centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truith you know you can not deminish all your bottom line for you know making your workers feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (2624/ 9618) 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um uh i think there is something else in the bible where you know she the he lady gives givs only a small portion compared to a large portion but in relation to what her income was that meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved in that we need do promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialize we need to think more of that but i think it s realy take home at night what would you bou doing if your third world country did not have a choice 

Recording: (2625/ 9618) 
i shaigd this we will never work i am not interested take it back and he said no noo no just let us just work with us just work with us we will we will take care of this so i ended up selling to hem for higrean forty four but it was just funny because i thought i though i they are never going to get to where i have to be and we are not even going no play this game back and forth 

Recording: (2626/ 9618) 
i thought it was stupid 

Recording: (2627/ 9618) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um like said by no means my saying yeay go president clinton or anything like that but u i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2628/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (2629/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2630/ 9618) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (2631/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2632/ 9618) 
umum umhum yeah i guess my i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own careers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals and the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it there or whatever and the kids um they are basic where they learn things is their peers they do not get it everything instilled at home uh that is pretty much what you know i seeing talk unti my husband and you know and there irs so many broken homes and single moms and trying to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and huving to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (2633/ 9618) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they i probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i a the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the women is movements started and many men they are stil having always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talke to them and i talked to uh high school students or even young college students um therer there is a a whole world of difference between their attitudes and a lot of things and you know women is minority issues there is just second hand to thema it does not you know it is not like it was for us which was a cea change for them it is normal so and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote  you know you would have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did and ninety two andg get out that college vote 

Recording: (2634/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (2635/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2636/ 9618)

Recording: (2638/ 9618) 
uhhuh iis it was cool  eah so i i like pretty much all kinds of music ah dig some times to find kind of music i really do not like that much and i like some country music my i guess my favorites are are classical and uh rock rock and role especially i like some of the stuff that is coming out now i like olddiesn the seventies and sixties and uh i guess what is hard for me to listen to is i guess i do not know it used to be duba nci where they part of the reason was i they just played the same songs over and over again yeah 

Recording: (2639/ 9618) 
oh my gosh they they do not have any of these like student mattina specials we you  going for like a buck fifty huh 

Recording: (2640/ 9618)

Recording: (2688/ 9618) 
rih 

Recording: (2689/ 9618) 
um i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because it is more interesting it is a lot more practical you know it is a little more problem solving less runing around tan shooting things you know um it is like problem solving type you know little puzles it is not as much sit in front of a tv and be entertained to it is you create your n entertainment yu know

even though i knew better at the point when i was faced with that at seventeen or whatever i wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that i you know what i mean and i knew better but you just you know and it is like well i was not that strong granted but i was probably the normal team and i think most of the people i knew at that age were lost at much younger than seventeen you know  ia eleven twelves like o y we even looklike od forget it but um yeah so i think i think birth control would be good and

Recording: (2761/ 9618) 
um i do not i mean theyare definitely is that image of you know dallas and daynto i think it is it is worse i think for the the image of the tourists like basically they think anyone who can for ato be over there must be absolutely loaded you know and that was sort of another thing when you know i went to school there is you know i had a schollarshi that is how i wend there you know and i worked the whole time what we was in high school and college and all this kind of thing but it was just like you know people just thought oh you are amer can you are heare there for you must have lots of extra money to throw around and you know they just sort of do not grassp the fackt that you know you can have made sacrifices to be there but i do think also in films you know i remember ectally being in brisstl and that fhom california with bat pen jo wly le ise and you know there ind the trailer and everything else and you know theyare axsand ind  and i remember a bunch of people we are sitting and this sort of loungeroom watching this and they said like oh you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it is like cand the south and i thought oice you know what an image to have of like the south and you know i was just kind of shocked at theth but i think that they are you know with  you know people who are goingtng overe there and things like that there is not esrily that apinyon maybe you know in e sortin sextar like when all you ave heard is the consumption and everything else they are migh be more of that idea but i think you know most people like me ore what ver they they wuh i the like but you know people who have more education sort of not even without having to really think about it but you know theyre is not just that blatin view i meank i think that itit is um the con somption thing like i think o lot more realize now that you know i think americans have this just reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending and like ovpously when you give that iclosor look some many people are and dhat i mean i think i just saw something else omn thing news thi tid you kno across the board we do not even breakeven w are like na get of one or something

Recording: (2766/ 9618)

Recording: (2772/ 9618) 
do whatever i want to some degree 

Recording: (2773/ 9618) 
but she does not believe it yeah yeah she is very pragmaticuhm yeah sh yeam she could probably 

Recording: (2774/ 9618) 
and pretty much stuff like that and he would try to quote the bible and i would have a bible there with me and i would look it up and it would not it would not be right at all

Recording: (2779/ 9618) 
well actually anybody can try you know there is a civil service exam you have to take and they place you on a list from that you know like say if you have an eighty well everybody that takes it after you that gets an eighty one yit is goingto get hired before you do and so you can take it again but if you squore lower you have got tokeep that lower score so that sometimes people are you know kind of apprehensive about doing that but uh once you pass that and then they say you knw the government o goes okay we are rady to hire a thousand people throughout the united states well each region there is regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region so they go down the list the first thirty and they call you know they are right each one of them and say we are offering you a position you  do you want it or not and you know some of the people have said i have ben on the list for two years and i have a you nw ik you now i hae a job and i do not want it now you know so and then those people have to go to okla homa city to the academy and go through a screening program which is really hard because at one time only forty percent of the people are making it through that

Recording: (2800/ 9618) 
especially if you are waiting to go into combat 

Recording: (2801/ 9618) 
i think that is too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but you know with aids and at as rampant ed as is now and there is so many more women that have it um started off it was mostly men um women have got to know as at an early age you know about these different diseases and things 

Recording: (2802/ 9618)

Recording: (2805/ 9618) 
but in the winters when you know i mean i do not exercise that much 

Recording: (2806/ 9618) 
t 

Recording: (2807/ 9618) 
it is ai wit is a uh clinical study where we are seeing how tread mill training affects ambulation and people wa spin al quit injury 

Recording: (2808/ 9618) 
i appreciate your opinions but were you asking did you have we seen a change in the politiciansin through our lifetime was that particulalr your point 

Recording: (2809/ 9618) 
i 

Recording: (2810/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (2811/ 9618) 
how uh do you think the is a heaven 

Recording: (2812/ 9618) 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is it is really he he nurches hem too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (2813/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2814/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2815/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2816/ 9618) 
ere in columbus yeah  i have always lived in collumbus yeah 

Recording: (2817/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (2818/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2819/ 9618) 
i went to ou for about three months but i was just got out of high school you know at i 

Recording: (2820/ 9618) 
i would just tell him that itis just a fieling he is going through whoghhe you know i ihve went through that were you know you you look at a woman and you are you she is attractive to you know but that is just something that is going through your mind and  i think it is like the devel getting into you because i would never sleep with a woman i would never do it even though i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or not drunk and just you know i would just tell thim that is something he is going through and that is wrong for him to do that ad he you know he is a man and that would tell hem guy did not put too men on this earth and if heu would  choose to do that that i would not hate him or disown him or anything like that 

Recording: (2821/ 9618) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of ourself aao as others and i think as you as we become older you start thinking about how um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here  uh professes to be the thing 

Recording: (2822/ 9618) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going ta have a a great time with your kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it is worth it 

Recording: (2823/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (2824/ 9618) 
yor 

Recording: (2825/ 9618) 
i do it so 

Recording: (2826/ 9618) 
he will basc yeah he will basically tell you he do not have nogh father except for me 

Recording: (2827/ 9618) 
welli 

Recording: (2828/ 9618) 
ll as it turned out he expected us to play the solos  but i we did not play the whole piece we only played one movement of it and um i thought it came out pretty well ii have it recording of it for a while there i was worried that we did not get a recording of it and i was really upset 

Recording: (2829/ 9618) 
right you you you can not really ignore i have heard people say i refuse to read the dispach wel you got to know what is going on locally i am sorry but uh 

Recording: (2830/ 9618) 
and so that is a whole different that is real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 

Recording: (2831/ 9618) 
yeah up on bassle road 

Recording: (2832/ 9618) 
if if you did not own let us say on a school leve and you i you pay taxes i always beecause i rent and i always get very upset uh i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is build into the rent ut least iti it ought to be or i have a pretty dum landlord  y uh and i do not i have never lived any place where my rent and did not go up after school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uof what the leviye was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because  a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation uf a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh your democracy could go down the drain uh that was why tomas jefferson founded to many schools or you know the the youniversity of virgindioua and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you know but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talk to some uh almost college ai students and they do not see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (2833/ 9618) 
i had considered that yes 

Recording: (2834/ 9618) 
umhum yeah i well i think basically that goes back to uh you know the parenthing and everything you know there wis something missing in the uh uh the child is life you know hh uh that he was not getting perhaps attention uh those kids in particular i do not understand how they could be building bombs and inte basemen and mon a dad not know what war going on you know mean uh itis tis  tragidy i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh uh we were like aboud noa know uh eleven years old or something like that well  accidentals shooting yau ad an bun uh u another friend of mine from saymg same clisf you know uh he pulled a gun and shot him you knowi did no know tand thing was lov it but a ney were talking about another thing  about that you know where i some kid i guess that happened just here in town ah couple a about a week ou go or something like that you know where guy shot akother guo but i mean those things are just senseless crimes really you know and who is really a fault who is really to who is guilty i do no know uh i would like to ave uh  not to ta ever would ofe but if if one of the two that you tat calomba and you know if they would have survived i o like tho seen what was going through there ahead you know but that is something we will never know 

Recording: (2835/ 9618) 
she did not she did not say anything i mean they would not let her 

Recording: (2836/ 9618) 
yes 

Recording: (2837/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2838/ 9618) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones hee just every one of them is different 

Recording: (2839/ 9618) 
what is different ish my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle it was i mean still is my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oh an tangiy village i am right in where i always was i mean i am i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a  full circle there but collumbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other cities of course i am i loved oregonn i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (2840/ 9618) 
o umhum 

Recording: (2841/ 9618) 
it is in in education it is it is top they preduce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education business schools coming up like they are building a new building but by i will be gone aby the time it is done if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for a small schooland they just open up with their pht program in education and they are also knowing for political science but it is a real conservative political science and ike itis a real conservative schoo and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things uh like the it is dry they have uh real strict visitation policies things like that and my thought is if you are in if you are if you are considere an adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember whand i was a freshman in college  ws we did crazy things but still 

Recording: (2842/ 9618) 
south pacific 

Recording: (2843/ 9618) 
made you well awareof 

Recording: (2844/ 9618) 
i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that i it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are  are not in a positive relationship for each other wore for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say lk this is not working we both deserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i think that i i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinating things and i know that sounds kind of petty but just um  i i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different

well at depends i think i like to do new stuff but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites uh and he symphony um unfortunately they tend to have budget problems uecause a lot of the people in that group ere paid u  i get ti gt  paid kind of a semi professional as aspect thing where you get paid per service but um let us see so they have toh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for with the amount of music that they want to do  and uh this last year we played ah movement of the shumon concert piece for four horns an orchestra and i was a little bit flabbergasted when i saw that on thi schedul at the beginng of the year because it is really hard to play  and i thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody 

Recording: (2901/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2902/ 9618) 
difficult exactly getting

Recording: (2907/ 9618) 
thinkso 

Recording: (2908/ 9618) 
no it it is i uh it is in the ag college but uh why it is there i do not know it is just a matter of how they fit id in there but it is dealing with construction management 

Recording: (2909/ 9618) 
but uh but even so the uh we were on list and the germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could again look right down at us so we did not go out in the daylight hardly at all 

Recording: (2910/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (2911/ 9618) 
yeah yep 

Recording: (2912/ 9618) 
columbus umhum i went to i ended up  in a alternative school system all along i was i got into the lottery they used i i made it into every school i applied for 

Recording: (2913/ 9618) 
i mean we went in there one day and you know i explained the whole thing to her and then she puts off some kind of excuse the administrator she says well we do not need problems students like yourself loblabla i said what problem 

Recording: (2914/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2915/ 9618) 
oh no never have 

Recording: (2916/ 9618) 
the right 

Recording: (2917/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2918/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (2919/ 9618) 
othings coming to mind no 

Recording: (2920/ 9618) 
yeah that is what i wam saying 

Recording: (2921/ 9618) 
than to do that 

Recording: (2922/ 9618) 
you are allowed to have guess well the same sex like you sayi like  i do not live in the dorms but assuming i did if i wan if i had a girl come from home to visit me i would have to either sneak her in  and like just hope we did not get caught or have her stay out of friends 

Recording: (2923/ 9618) 
my roommate 

Recording: (2924/ 9618) 
the ultimate would probably be a parttime thing you know but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time where we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is they get a little bit of both  the world so 

Recording: (2925/ 9618) 
i she is always trying to recruit people to come and visiter but it is tike a two hour drie and then everybody is busy you know that is four hours of driving and um i do not know it is just too hard to keep everybody in touch that way but 

Recording: (2926/ 9618) 
umum i was at ugine and i was not even in ugine it was a hundred thousand you know and uh i loved that but i then i came back and i live in olontanci village which is right on the river and it is very uh very cenic very beautifl 

Recording: (2927/ 9618) 
es umhum yeah i do miss that but at the same time i have you know i had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things so and i mean there there are you know it is obviously you can not compare it but you know there are cultural things to do in collumbus and it does sort of make me mad when you know people look kind of like  columbus you know there is no not think o to do there i find myself defending collumbus a lot more now than 

Recording: (2928/ 9618) 
hommeck i am yeah am sure that was useful to for people that did not cook or do anything showed them how to turn a oven on or 

Recording: (2929/ 9618) 
um weall it was in sixty nines when i went in so you know you can kind of figure that it was  a 

Recording: (2930/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (2931/ 9618) 
because there is no fear of being caught by the parents there is 

Recording: (2932/ 9618) 
um so they sort oh send them on their way or whatever and she did have the opportunity to come back 

Recording: (2933/ 9618) 
it is 

Recording: (2934/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (2935/ 9618) 
exactly exactly 

Recording: (2936/ 9618) 
there is no issue 

Recording: (2937/ 9618) 
and to me that is considered suburbia so and to me ashlen is considered the sticks i mean there is e there is imish buggies that go by 

Recording: (2938/ 9618) 
uh i annot i can not believe she came back 

Recording: (2939/ 9618) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (2940/ 9618) 
i talk to her everyday 

Recording: (2941/ 9618) 
well i am lucky in that way because um i get to travel a lot and it and so you know if there is something i really want to see chicago is not that far washington is not that far um new york uh you know i do not get to new york that often but uh you know i mean i can i still have access to a lot of stuff if i want to go to the trouble 

Recording: (2942/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (2943/ 9618) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think i do not want either one of these people there should be anone of the above you know if there is at that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (2944/ 9618) 
being turned away 

Recording: (2945/ 9618) 
uh his daughter is twelve 

Recording: (2946/ 9618) 
ah probably 

Recording: (2947/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2948/ 9618) 
but now it seems like people are just like i do not know why that is a trend i mean my dad said uh he grew up in the bronks 

Recording: (2949/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (2950/ 9618) 
that is 

Recording: (2951/ 9618) 
sah i almost bought one um a k couple  weeks ago in fact i i went into contract on it with this guy deer old man who is it was for his mother who was inher nineties an a retiremet a it was on royal forest which is north and i made this the slow offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i am the baby coming and we are gong no be busy and i did not wan i get involved in and so i made this offer and then he countered back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he counterd back an ninety six and i said  you know i thought w gould have to worry about it he is never going to come to it so i wrote back and said you know i appreciateyr aver but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two if i was really of the only thing i could i i could do and i did not even give him tha time be to respond because i just jussumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2952/ 9618) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that it is being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there i things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything to overpowerful as far as  the number of guys being out there eyare violent i mean it is something it unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2953/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2954/ 9618) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy cozy i have a 

Recording: (2955/ 9618) 
uyah 

Recording: (2956/ 9618) 
or just was going down like 

Recording: (2957/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2958/ 9618) 
um and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that is still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um so i do not think i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger more comfortable movie theaters and and that kind of stuff at it has not really 

Recording: (2959/ 9618) 
o usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2960/ 9618) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least let s uss know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that as you increase your knowlege you are far better off than to stay in this little hole over here and this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (2961/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2962/ 9618) 
umum parties did not change at all 

Recording: (2963/ 9618) 
well uh the first h the first thing is clintonvill 

Recording: (2964/ 9618) 
i just really think he is 

Recording: (2965/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (2966/ 9618) 
it is really cool yeas yes 

Recording: (2967/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2968/ 9618) 
um i think they can help but i think it has to be something that society in general are family 

Recording: (2969/ 9618) 
put bathrooms and kitchen and stuff 

Recording: (2970/ 9618) 
i think columbus is really interesting how it how it devel t develops compared to like i do not know just like how indianap like how collumbus is di it is a aa real standard midwest city just how it is designed and laihd out compared to likepolitolpphia you know or it just beg like when it was settled and and when it was made  just ow like more the streets are more it is all like planed out more ii opposed to like and and filly where places like that more east coast it is like the roaads  parts of them are real small and like then other parts are all hilly and curving around and is uff and s so that is kind of interesting i mean i think it is also uh like that erban sprallp columbus how um this just the suburbs develope and how it is ike more of a metropoiptan area it s apoised to ute centralited  area thit is really big like our like columbusis downtown it it is really od too i mean ever there is nothing to do down thereit it is all business is and like the couple of shops that are down there colose tat like ix i mean there is like a couple of restaurants or something but i mean it is it is different when you think of other cities you know it is more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it is like campus and h we are more of uh 

Recording: (2971/ 9618) 
but i mean it is was nothing too serious or violent i mean 

Recording: (2972/ 9618) 
so everybody is trying to be like everyone else 

Recording: (2973/ 9618) 
oh you do not ask an easy one do you  that is that is really a 

Recording: (2974/ 9618) 
that they do not weare like the lad hawaan shirts and and you know n the shorts and the camera is that that they do they 

Recording: (2975/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (2976/ 9618) 
yeah not that they could have stopped it but they they should have known what was going on i i really think if they were close with their children they would have known something was wrong especially with these kids who are so removed and do not talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways you know that they are you know going ah turning a different  you know i just i blame them though 

Recording: (2977/ 9618) 
yeah i hear 

Recording: (2978/ 9618) 
yeah which is good for me because i do not ever go there anyway so 

Recording: (2979/ 9618) 
and you do not have to worry if she wites her name backwards like a mer image 

Recording: (2980/ 9618) 
and then once a month we wil have a leadership majual which is uh the business ethics part and you know sat gol setting and that type thing and then once a month wewill just have like donatos pietsa and like just just discussed basic u nd just general things like events coming up we had we planted the flowers at mer field last weekend and the weekend beforesitto i do not know i can not wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tve an like i planted those u  you see the the n jack nicolas golf statue in front of the club house i planted the flowers around that no i i do not want to watch it for the gulf at all i just want to turn it on and see it occasionally 

Recording: (2981/ 9618) 
nobody around nothing buth land yeah 

Recording: (2982/ 9618) 
i would not 

Recording: (2983/ 9618) 
yeah i do i really do i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but um it is amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they do not realize you know theire old guns that they compiscate and they do not realize where they are going i mean that amazes me um but there is always going to be the under world an different ways that kids and people can get guns and it is sad i do not know how we could ever limit that but there irs so many millions of guns in the world that you know you are wondering wheree they all coming from u i think but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new guns that um not just a safety lock but you know you it is like an identification thing you know 

Recording: (2984/ 9618) 
oh really 

Recording: (2985/ 9618) 
oh it was a football game deal 

Recording: (2986/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (2987/ 9618) 
and yet we sit down and negotiate for it and then on top of it those people that participate in the um sponsers are just as bad 

Recording: (2988/ 9618) 
excuse me well typically what i observed is conflict you know with mom most of the time uh well i think a lot of times when there is a step farther involved you know that becomes a problem for some of them but they said you know you might run into a case where you know the family is abusing uh the child you know but i did not run into that 

Recording: (2989/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (2990/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (2991/ 9618) 
that is why it is mainly appealing to inestate people you they pay you to go to school 

Recording: (2992/ 9618) 
you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2993/ 9618) 
okay

Recording: (2997/ 9618) 
great yeah it was like oh this makes sense and you might have these other wonderful things that i am used to but he is got all of this  so i will get that little slice and take the rest so that worked out

Recording: (3043/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3044/ 9618) 
i i think it is because uh uh when i i was a sofhimore in high school before it dauwgned on me that taa and slat be innin relation to this stuff that we were learning with the charts ind the diagrams and um but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they are exposed to you know in movies and everything you know just tv just daily life um i they are a lot more aware they they have i i they they go into it with a lot of of uh miths and misapprehensions but they definitely have thoughts about it and and i think they i think they need to know 

Recording: (3045/ 9618) 
yeah like when i need things and i call them up i need dipers uey wipes andhe twenty dollars yeah he is there for me  for that financially uh he is always been there for me 

Recording: (3046/ 9618)

Recording: (3047/ 9618) 
like on a fairly regular basis even 

Recording: (3048/ 9618) 
yeah it is well basically it is like ah it is about the size of a very small hotel room and then it is got a seperat bathroom with like a big bath tub and there is like thes te like itis  room with therpy which is a little box on the wale about tha speg that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is a nathrom where people can come and sit down there is like a fold out couch bed for whoever is in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3049/ 9618) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years your junior and senior year and um like your junior ou go in the morning and you r senior oud go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cur centeran then you go 

Recording: (3050/ 9618) 
t 

Recording: (3051/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3052/ 9618) 
just because you know it was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the text book they would not know how to do it you know like where if people id not have theiro notts like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um d so i think it it s when people have real enthusiasm and like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not the same every day and not just like a lecture and whend then we do home work anturniday and like you know it is like we do like like in history class we do like roalle rolle playing things and like

they just can not single out what i should attend to and what i should screen out so they attend to everything an we equally the train going by out here the teacher talking up here the kid over here shuffling his papers this kid back here picking up his pensile and so they get a little bit of everything and they do not learn anything 

Recording: (3060/ 9618) 
nd there is people  like that today still you go but i think people should go to um retirement centers uh uh and uh sit down make a visit to them every week make it part of their life and develup a friendship 

Recording: (3061/ 9618)

umhum 

Recording: (3076/ 9618) 
a little bit of both i think i looked into somephonics i went to the library checked out some phonic tape let him watch those because kids love to watch things  and just reading with them and going over things and it is it is been amazing just to see it is like the lightba comes on and 

Recording: (3077/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3078/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (3079/ 9618) 
well yeah i could have just took thim out in the woods and whipped him but what is that going to prove 

Recording: (3080/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3081/ 9618) 
s in your room it is just like forty of any other kind it is plenty 

Recording: (3082/ 9618)

Recording: (3083/ 9618) 
um i i took a class for war procing wr war processing one an too i took those and um i tell you truith i can not remember if they taught me how to balance a checkbook out 

Recording: (3084/ 9618) 
he 

Recording: (3085/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3086/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3087/ 9618) 
sure 

Recording: (3088/ 9618) 
you do not side 

Recording: (3089/ 9618) 
um i probably would like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3090/ 9618) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (3091/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (3092/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3093/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (3094/ 9618) 
and i have got friends that do that and i just i do not i do not feel right od not want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming and around and stuff there is no way uhuh 

Recording: (3095/ 9618) 
umhum yeah 

Recording: (3096/ 9618) 
i know those are halls 

Recording: (3097/ 9618) 
so am kind of doing that and then i figure i am probably goin to waike tables at night  and and finish going to school during the day so 

Recording: (3098/ 9618) 
well he is uh xportant cars illegally 

Recording: (3099/ 9618) 
now like i toll her is a whay i was raised 

Recording: (3100/ 9618) 
that is that is yeah s developetmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now theyhe found out that the full dominance does not take over until about eaige eight 

Recording: (3101/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3102/ 9618) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really learne and tryed to decide what you want to do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers were not there and they had to clean they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feeld that they kind of missed out on things u but i think you know kids lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents worked i am not sure if the combine if both parents worked but i do not thnk just the mother being home there would have totally helped kno 

Recording: (3103/ 9618) 
yes 

Recording: (3104/ 9618) 
yes 

Recording: (3105/ 9618) 
eh 

Recording: (3106/ 9618) 
but uh her mother stayed with us fo or several uh two or three years and she was a baby setter for her oldest boy 

Recording: (3107/ 9618) 
and it really is not though because wen because o i think it is actually it is really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can get along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has ther prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life for everyone 

Recording: (3108/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3109/ 9618) 
ye yeah i saw that patience in the morning 

Recording: (3110/ 9618) 
i am a freelance artist um a illustrator ui fact u marketing communications for ohio state is one is one of my big clients and um uh i also i also have various part time jobs for the medical insurance 

Recording: (3111/ 9618) 
i know it is connected to likeh you know england because it is i i guess that is i guess uh i maybe like england owned it once so the 

Recording: (3112/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (3113/ 9618) 
and uh it did not hurt me not you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you know ats your neighborhoods your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood yeven you know how many empty lots do you see nowadays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had gocarts we had many bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3114/ 9618) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3115/ 9618) 
umhum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they are doing a very good job of that 

Recording: (3116/ 9618) 
itt it is not a presidential issue cained at issue as far as i am concerned but uuh i am 

Recording: (3117/ 9618) 
would not have even stopped heis sitting there going what dare you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested me and he took my neckless tried to take em radio too and uh o know i kind of through that in there and make it sound bad bu i was on my way to work i mean i did not want anything bad to happen to me or him you know so all ind all the cop you know put the guy and handcouffs put ing back he car  because whel do you want to press charges and at that time i was a little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let him out of the car i will beat his ass  uh mand the cob said sometig  i l never forget he said i would but that probably have to bea my job to do if we was living like that  i was like god and m rid and king all over again not 

Recording: (3118/ 9618) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but uh that is interesting uh h you know when they when the first when the uh when time began you know quarterd tom my uh what i believe in and everything you know it was man and woman got married you know and and reason they got married wis because of procreation you know keep to keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i hade no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman but u if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3119/ 9618) 
motherly instinct towards you know oh and they arel like old eric you should have one and you know and he knows im kve one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals 

Recording: (3120/ 9618) 
cand you really 

Recording: (3121/ 9618) 
see and i can not eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to los vegas with my dad and i we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind of glad she did not um the small fish always kind of bothered me but until i tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i brok out in to a rash i mean it was like a heat rash it started imyne 

Recording: (3122/ 9618) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to thim because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times and you make an erer and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh you know like there is an air plan ovethere and i tell you to turn that way and i really ment for you turn left and sta right and you may come back and go uh do you do you mean left or right there and i go yes it is correct  turn left you know youkhw so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kindness goes a long way and the pilot is the same way theyrh most often they are you know pretty decent 

Recording: (3123/ 9618) 
well i ou 

Recording: (3124/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3125/ 9618) 
yeah uh and it is  to me that is sort of a slap on the rist and you tell the parents what you have done it that the kid did and you do not want him to do it again and let it go they suspended i i i do not know  of course  i  a probably say this i got this version of this story from the collumbus dispatch so it is probably not the whole story  yeah it is 

Recording: (3126/ 9618) 
it is that is why i quit 

Recording: (3127/ 9618) 
ts like we do not have one at home because we are worried at that 

Recording: (3128/ 9618) 
yeah because i have like a problem with getting to know people you know like i am shy at first 

Recording: (3129/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (3130/ 9618) 
umum 

Recording: (3131/ 9618) 
yeah i mean that is pretty much what we was made to do you know back in the pioneer days you did not have this crap with the kid going gt fixed me some caned raviole or you gave that kid a shotgunnd he went out there and killed his on mels that is an interesting thing i just saw in the and the news week i was reading that and 

Recording: (3132/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3133/ 9618) 
uh pychology 

Recording: (3134/ 9618) 
which i feel has been com like completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war uh i hae inherited of this world where there were of uh uh harmy going with this  um i mean the generation before is had like ve nom e protestedd against it and i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before but i mean when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know in i am not being clear eaus i am not ex aclly sure where i am going  i am very cynenical o u about about the world i have inherited uh because i see a world in which my political views have been silenced by fifty years of of you know like ointernational politics un in sort of i propaganda um that is says you know like to be left of a certain point is bad uh like among conservative circales the word liberal is is like  almost like calling so in a communist in in the forties um where as  i am very cinical about that because i thiy feel that it it was not it it it is been a cultural process that has been developed and now i am being handed this current situation which i see as completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is sa cinical ow the reason i am cinical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the  the the hipocracy i mean i guess in justice id also applies ind terms of things like the cold war and stuff it that is why i am cinical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit ou knon a i feel kind of pre ike this is my position 

Recording: (3135/ 9618) 
taking classes hopefully that is when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too 

Recording: (3136/ 9618)

Recording: (3139/ 9618) 
i 

Recording: (3140/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (3141/ 9618) 
as temmt i have a very general uh oppoition to this kind of thing uh no matter where it is anymore uh my being seventy cix yearsof age has a major bearing because i see thethe total destruction of our center cities uh nd ni say when i speak of center cities i do not necessarily mean just citieis the size of columbaus whics whicsj is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washing ton cort house which may be have fifteen thousand or uh uh wadsworth which may be haveateen thousand uh this kinds tha things being doveloped on the perifperal the cities its just totally destroying those and i consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not do not know our neighbors at all anymore the uh it is quite common anymore that if you go three houses down you have kno idea who tos folks are how they feel what they my do for yo or you can do for them uh and i all pplice to the pelaras question is i see it and i think also that uhi it is it i a very very major financial uh gained for the developpers who are doing it and it is going to there for harm uh the many many areas is s that affect it such as north north north north north  what is thename of the shop uh north y nrtheran i yea north and i can not ev ay th

Recording: (3159/ 9618) 
plus the mental health aspect of it you know you think 

Recording: (3160/ 9618)

Recording: (3161/ 9618) 
now i worked at the library when i was a student 

Recording: (3162/ 9618)

but then he disowns me so it does not matter 

Recording: (3172/ 9618) 
h 

Recording: (3173/ 9618) 
the simplest things 

Recording: (3174/ 9618) 
well we figure in a few years he will um 

Recording: (3175/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3176/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3177/ 9618) 
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh when they were planning this thing with uh with a high state to uh you know like had the shot an stene center down at uh down closer to downtown or or something like uh an play hapier ball games there or something like that but but a high state do not need that you know they got ter lon stuff so 

Recording: (3178/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3179/ 9618) 
well i do not think thery should be respons bwat i think u kids go to school and they need roal models good teachers um au kno i think schools have gott a lot abhetter about thaut it seem like in the late eighties arly ninetiese you know the schools a lot of them are really bad um i think finally the ed ducation department or whatever realizing that parents need help with their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot um and i thinkyou know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many roural earers and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is warry have to do with money an theam not y making enough money whics the teachers do not make enough money and they are overwork and all these big large classrooms it jus seems to me when kids start dressing in getting in a colleck together you know it woul be hard for them to inter being in say oh what is going on and your life what  your what s the prolem you know that is that is not really should be their role but um  if they care enough they should call the parents and say look were worried about your son you misses a lot school or he tarting to dress really you know i sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning again then nor about the society you know and if theydo not want to be ing sports that is fine there is so many different things that they can do and in school and a earn about arts and music and you know but um un fortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up theslack of what the parents can not do but its some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you untill you got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3180/ 9618) 
getting so conjested i that is what i do not like 

Recording: (3181/ 9618)

Recording: (3240/ 9618) 
yeah i thought that was interesting uh some of  it is a values you know they they christian values thing uh i did not have problem with we had little problems like my son had to learn the hel mary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us u righte it down for his because we did not know and they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he hot mark ot and we and we did not k youah th little things like that but it was not a problem uh there was a problem with my son for a while because the preests they had there would not let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion and hit is pretty much the preest decides that and he and he felt singled out and he was i mean he was the only one and he was uncomfortable with that uh but it has some been a problem u i am not a religious person myself but i am not against it and if i and maybe i have justifyed it  myself by saying whel they are teaching values 

Recording: (3241/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3242/ 9618) 
yad ow 

Recording: (3243/ 9618) 
although janet you just said yesterday that people are so overweigt in columbus because there is not very much to do that actually 

Recording: (3244/ 9618) 
yeah and because ih back when i was in high school in my ap government class i was paying intention a lot you know like i read the colmus dispach every day and i read us news and world report from my economics class and i was totally caught up with everything 

Recording: (3245/ 9618) 
did you teach a university logh

Recording: (3248/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3249/ 9618) 
um i think i am gong no i wew i really like the rizer military because it shows disciplin responsibility repect for you go to a columbus public school and the kids will lash out on substitute teachers i think it is really crazy um i think you should have a lot more respect for your elders your adults 

Recording: (3250/ 9618) 
and uh he let me fire one  month range but i got about fifty or seventy five yards from the what we were shooting at 

Recording: (3251/ 9618) 
oh uh place on some land with woods and uh yeah water things like that 

Recording: (3252/ 9618) 
oh yeah i have no idea 

Recording: (3253/ 9618) 
and that is essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it is wright or wrong whether we think the previous supreme court was wright or wrong it is been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it would create too much too many problems for people you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it is too late 

Recording: (3254/ 9618) 
i do not know uh maybe i i think ie if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more ike ih you have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but ituh so it is just like people always talk about you know education for thith you know we got i like think about our childs feacher or whatever but really teachers or paid crap and ike do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get get like more of a respect but ik it is just like  like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods and an your life like in like especially in outof lessons to like really influence like how you are as a person and and like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subjectyou are going to hate that subject you know and like if you have good teachers you are going to love it i mean they are really in influences too like how like what you want to do with your life you know and people do not really acknowlege that too much 

Recording: (3255/ 9618) 
um kind of uh i mean ite was something i was really into uh until i do not know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which point things sort of switched or you know like i do not know like killer robuts or something like transformers an that kind of thing uh in high school i uh i do ot n i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys and like starwars is fun i am going to watch starwars more often i had them on tape so i started watching hem  got i i d not wan to say into it because i know people who are really into it i am pretty into it but it is not the same kind of thing i do not think but back when i started doing the the painting  i i graduated from high school in nighty four just to put things in a little perspective uh so is like my first couple of years at college uh from sort of the second half i high schoolt my first couple of years at college i just sort of just i do not know i like the story um 

Recording: (3256/ 9618) 
because they kicked me out for some dum reason they confused me with somebody else and i ended up taking the blame 

Recording: (3257/ 9618) 
um you get prority for scheduling you have to apply for it like separately and i think you have to have like certain um class standing and sat scores where you can rite an esay an theywil let you in anyway um let us see you get priority for scheduling i think you go after versity athletes and disabilities and that is it 

Recording: (3258/ 9618) 
no because honestly like gor to me it is like a besht out of a bad bunch like if i have to choose i will choose gor but that does not mean i necessarily like he is most in line with a lot of my style with a lot of my views o sometin mean rong i am not completely liberal on everything like there is certain things i guess maybe because going to school an to ashalthen it just rubs off on you there ise certain things like i am not so liberal about but i do not really like gors just seems so dry and just not it is hard to i think it wuld be hard to get people enthusiastic for them 

Recording: (3259/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3260/ 9618) 
anhe does have a responsibility but i think there could be a line drawn how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been you know 

Recording: (3261/ 9618) 
because the mother um he played her because he was with me and you know if and she just was like forget him i do not want him to be reound much child and the other one she i older she is they she is like ten and um he says that because his daughter do not call he only she only calls for when she wants things so he does not you know he will he will get whatever he can for er when she calls but he does not spend time with her 

Recording: (3262/ 9618) 
uh i have i have uh you know there are kids in the neighborhood and uh the growing up stock and ii talk to the kids too i there is a ah girh lives next door we we talk a lot she just started at um evrit the uh arts middle school 

Recording: (3263/ 9618) 
he admits now that he felt neglected at that period 

Recording: (3264/ 9618) 
yeah i mean i it is it it is it is it is a touch i think it is i think it is tough and i think it is really an individual basis but i would not i would say that there is a lot of other things that are that would contribute more to any cietale problems than divorce i really do not think that that would be the main 

Recording: (3265/ 9618) 
oh right 

Recording: (3266/ 9618) 
plays and like like just things that are different and like my sociology and pychology teacher were wre real he  he was the same guy taught historyn he was real good too like it was really crazy obviously but like it is just like interesting um like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about it you know just 

Recording: (3267/ 9618)

Recording: (3273/ 9618)

Recording: (3274/ 9618) 
oh i was good to say it would be interesting

Recording: (3410/ 9618) 
umhum yeah yeah i would say anything outside like doing that

they uh i said i did not belong to any groups and that is not true i belong to ahio desighner craftsmen and um uh they in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio artists but the membership is is national so uh it is not it is not really closed it is just sort of focusing on ohio

Recording: (3426/ 9618) 
l e see i am limited on some of the stuff i like do i like to well i like to go back into working with my hands and stuff i used to do maintenance uh there aignt nothing i can not fix

Recording: (3434/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3435/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (3436/ 9618) 
that is i mean we would be seventy years old when the kid graduates from high school uh and that would not be fair to the kid and and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so we talked about int decided it was not a good idea 

Recording: (3437/ 9618) 
ou would think by now you know this would not matter 

Recording: (3438/ 9618) 
there isbring some of the things he has on there an some of the people i think they ought to arrest him for a brlin showm on tv 

Recording: (3439/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3440/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (3441/ 9618)

Recording: (3442/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3443/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (3444/ 9618)

m 

Recording: (3448/ 9618) 
yeah and then it is come home you kn then it is come home to that and it is so different it i i do not know it is just the motherly thing the kids just you know they draw to their mothers 

Recording: (3449/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3450/ 9618) 
that is that is really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campain that she ran negatives do not work in collumbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play in collumbus what plase in the state and tand the people who ran her campaign ran voinofich is campaign and betty mont gumerie is campain and and that negativestuff worked state whd at does not work so well in collumbus um i i think iit even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost u and i like to think that age does not matter but she came across as old to me also and i like to think i am not prejudiced on on any issue but if there was a someone who had been wrghte on the issues i do not care she was old i would have voted for she just did not support the issues i support ed she was wrong on uh i i did not like that she triyed to use um the police chief ind such a negative way by saying that um colman had voted for a raise for the chiefe well yes he voted for a raise for a chiefe but he voted for a raise for the the police officers itis just that you know the police chief was tied to hisand i do not like people who tried to manipulate facts uh and and that was manipulating the facts i did not like that she was um uh uh a against the the the tiff uh in polarus once it was voted i thought it ws more important whether it was wright or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with but once it was voted and implace i thought her reputation was on the line and for her to try to use a nother device of issue just to get elected did not sit well with me um so i o not even if she had a lot of carisima carisima does not mean as much to me as a person stand 

Recording: (3451/ 9618)

Recording: (3490/ 9618) 
but that is what they go through 

Recording: (3491/ 9618) 
well i did not necessarily want to wnn wherever my family started me out they um are alternative to the public schools supposedly um just more i do not know exactly how to explain it the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything 

Recording: (3492/ 9618) 
um not do soelike a broken record but i really think it is are uh backslide on onfamily un its i think it is too easy this day i and i have been married and divorced so i have unfortunately have that experience to me um but it is too easy to get divorced um people do not really go into marriage with commit ment an life time and have that i do not wan to say old fassiond values but just the valyou i this is a very important um because let us face it  to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want to smack him and he is being a little burny but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes i and letem behold of an hour later week later whatav whatever long it takes i am in love with thim again i mean really you know what i am saying and um i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying in ta marriage for the sake of  children but i think if you really make that commitmet and actually work on it you can have a great realationship you can have kids and bring them up in ia more stable environment um i unfortunately i think that is the problem parents um or a either are getting divorced and then they get caught up and their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you know use in the kid as a medium um or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did not i i do not want to say selfish but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedule and u  not spend enough time with the kids you know they are work in wetin onit and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that um and i do not think enough families are doing that 

Recording: (3493/ 9618)

Recording: (3498/ 9618) 
or on your hard drive um because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft or i will say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over have somebody else proof read it because you are not going to see the mistakes because you are too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say and you are not going to notice them spelled th im or they th awi yeah or  al sentence that is too long or al sentence that is a fragment and it is not a complete thought you are not going no notice that because you know what it was supposed to say so give it to a friend or somebody and let them  just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they do not understand and that will really help you oh well i had a

Recording: (3551/ 9618) 
just my wife and i this time 

Recording: (3552/ 9618) 
uh just kind of like too ho there is no real like everybody conforms to their own set of norms ind each group you know it is like people no matter like you know even if ted cazinsky is out like on on you know whereever and like his little shed you know he is still a part of society like how you can not get away from society and just how like how society develops in general like how high school is like is it is kind of true to life but then really different to h on how life is but just how it is just ah a more of a like more of a closent thing so it is more apparent how how segragation works or whatever 

Recording: (3553/ 9618)

Recording: (3559/ 9618) 
well in some ways it is it i guess it is necessary but it is just you reminic about the way it used to look and and uh it was just at a place last night it was at this a public comment meeting for theh little darby national wild life refuge that they are planning for mattison county and uh there were some there was some talk about that and it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuge and there were people that were opposed to the wild life refuge mostly people that lived theire near theire farmers and  but it seemed like the one thing that almost everybody theyre agreed on was they did not want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments and uh  that we somebody was talking there about the difference between development here ind the united states and in europe uh and how development in in europe cens to take note of the fact that space is not limitless  so you will have more uh more people living in one house or one apartment building uh and they will go up rather than accross just to take up space and you known they they ware conscientious about preserving space and preserving wild space

Recording: (3622/ 9618) 
um i do not think that really matters honestly um i mean it is i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts yhou are usually eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up and i think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like and do not like um i can not see i can not see them actually looking at like uh their leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore um i mean obviously it should be someone that they respect but i can not say that they would be like oh well he does it so i am going ta have to do it too or whatever

green bay packers 

Recording: (3748/ 9618) 
how am i going to tell who is you know trying to butter me up by raising their hand and and asking questions um 

Recording: (3749/ 9618) 
perfect example you know or your computer can not tell you that you spelled o n e when you ment to spell db o n 

Recording: (3750/ 9618) 
that is true 

Recording: (3751/ 9618) 
t is just like there is a lot of different uh like influences and everything and like there is just a lot of places you can go with it so that is real good 

Recording: (3752/ 9618) 
that and i heard i kind of liked the change they are talking about they are talking about putting underground power lines and taking the pols out 

Recording: (3753/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3754/ 9618) 
yeah i so that is what i want to do just yeah 

Recording: (3755/ 9618) 
yeah yeah i mean maybe breakins are downwwen we are holding up seven elevens are down but then you hear these you know murders 

Recording: (3756/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (3757/ 9618) 
that would just be too scary for me 

Recording: (3758/ 9618) 
as back intointo high school 

Recording: (3759/ 9618) 
yeh 

Recording: (3760/ 9618) 
u well i uh westerville yeah so that is difficult for us to deal with 

Recording: (3761/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3762/ 9618) 
hat is where we are in our evolution tit 

Recording: (3763/ 9618) 
well  definitely if just happend to be when i was in the third grade onapuren too two of our friends were uh u went home afeteo school you were ping with a gun and everything and thand uh one of them shot and killed the other one you know accidentally uh it just goes to you know my dad always had te gun eet and did not have at locked up all tha tin i but you know it was not necisariln e sing play sole the tiething yoeither you know i mean so if you were not really looking for it you know yu hap to happand stay at just happen staycs on to it or somethingyou know h uh i bellieve now days you know that perhaps with the uh with e the gun o you know tabail ability af pe and more people hapen guns that do nthn no do not should not have themapparentely h you know they should be uh lot unde lock and kee uh you k aske for the you know the parents somebody is responsible foor it you know but see then you get into catch twenty two because of the legislation and you meand you can not require i do not see how you can require a uh he guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe pul the for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that in the case of a burglar comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some peer or something like that happenng other ways you should not have one un less you are sportsmanand uh then you know your bit is not going to be worse tha to have the gun in the first place so 

Recording: (3764/ 9618)

Recording: (3802/ 9618) 
yeah you can not say a nown is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than mathan science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not write can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at any of them once in a while youwill see a good speller because he can remember the order in which the letters come but he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell you know in his comprehension of the words of other kids his age woudt n be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 

Recording: (3803/ 9618) 
umhum yeahswe y 

Recording: (3804/ 9618) 
wel i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing theropist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech theropy with them so i got interested in the highper activity and so i started taking classes about o kne kids with eighd ahd and stuff and little by little for cno i had my master is in learning disabilities andi was mostly just so i could learn how tokeep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech theropyebut then when i found out there was so many openings and special ed so and then i found out later that speech theropy as a very good background for ld because a lot of these ld kids have language deficits and language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper where they do not process things correctly auditorially so that is the perfect background to work with ld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (3805/ 9618)

Recording: (3946/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (3947/ 9618) 
she was but i d admired her more  because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going to be the lipmius test it was just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party they would nominate such people as um mcgovern who had you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line left tof center liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it is easier to get that soled to the american public um so uh while i think dol was correct um i think yeah she shot herself on the foot i do nothink he would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controled by the extreme wright wing which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle which i think georgia dubia is trying to do um uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell them i tell them yes and i am an i uh and indifferent liberal 

Recording: (3948/ 9618) 
and they have met the couple that is going to adopt the baby which seems kind of od to me but

Recording: (3955/ 9618) 
i do not think forcing prayer on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (3956/ 9618) 
no because they are going to learn that on their own um i i personally think that it is a choice i do not think you are born that way because i i have friends that are home sexual and um you know i do not believe in what they are doing but i do not do everything right every day so i still love them and they are my friends and bobbelblock because but i have also known people that were that way and now are haderr sexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that um so it is in today is day and age they are going to learn about it quickly 

Recording: (3957/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (3958/ 9618) 
umhum that s el that is a bunch of  that is just one of those miths  i think that is to make people feel guilty or something 

Recording: (3959/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3960/ 9618) 
yeah well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it is smaller compared to most downtowns i mean you you know it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you are out so i do not think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice so 

Recording: (3961/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3962/ 9618)

Recording: (3988/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (3989/ 9618) 
hat they should do is just tell people if their kids do not get tho go to school i bet the attitude changes pretty fast 

Recording: (3990/ 9618)

Recording: (4002/ 9618)

Recording: (4009/ 9618) 
the tal okay 

Recording: (4010/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4011/ 9618) 
hu 

Recording: (4012/ 9618) 
uh the accents sometimes but uh they they they are okay i mean no no big problem but uh they the accents sometime it is like uh ire sort of a running joke kind of i jou say this but it is like if i can talk like tise and uh talk all the time like this why is it that they can not talk like we do you know it is like youknow if i can if i could talk that way because we do have pilots that do talk like 

Recording: (4013/ 9618) 
like let us go come on  well yeah because i ad lots  ppadur because they induced me because my doctor said hey it is time we can do this so i got it lucky even though i kind of wanted it to have it you know normal 

Recording: (4014/ 9618) 
all right 

Recording: (4015/ 9618) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4016/ 9618) 
issues so um you know that is one thing that that i hope that they they work on 

Recording: (4017/ 9618) 
well it would have been something that they would have supported and something that i would have probably been pretty good at 

Recording: (4018/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (4019/ 9618) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much ra system as whereas if you are my superviser i am just using it as an example and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4020/ 9618) 
she read my notes and all that 

Recording: (4021/ 9618) 
so i made a lot of stupid you know you look back and you see things you were like this is real obvious but at the time i think youthh i was like um a i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and you know that type of thing 

Recording: (4022/ 9618) 
nd then you come here you know what i mean you see people stand out on thestreet corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (4023/ 9618) 
oh yeah i think it is possible it would have to take the right combination of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people i think dol would have been a good candidate i would have been hart pressed i mean some of her issues i do not like but when she came out uh and said her her her fameous thing on the abbortion issue whend she came out against guns uh she went up a couple of notches in in in my estimation because i woas not sure where she would be i thought she would have to sell herself as hardlined with tha hardline republicans and then i would not have been able to vote for 

Recording: (4024/ 9618) 
and and she is very determined uh she has said that having this being pregnant and having thise baby is made her focus on things a lot differently she says she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (4025/ 9618) 
great guy but he surt of liked to get drunk you know and the problem was he would turn into such a jurk 

Recording: (4026/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4027/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4028/ 9618) 
umhum right right yeah 

Recording: (4029/ 9618) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good day care because theyt work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before you was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or some but in a church when it first started but you know it is just not you know people were always saying i can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to somebody is neighbor is house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and 

Recording: (4030/ 9618) 
thand than they were raised and they are but i told her i you know there is i will never be married if my man is gong to be chating on me i wil not marry him 

Recording: (4031/ 9618) 
ight and he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends and we still see them all a lot and we were close with their parents and 

Recording: (4032/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4033/ 9618) 
oh i see wel that woud be a good way i would think 

Recording: (4034/ 9618) 
whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down one road and then you wait a couplef years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethol and three fifteen nore things like that 

Recording: (4035/ 9618) 
yeah i 

Recording: (4036/ 9618) 
get it from us so 

Recording: (4037/ 9618) 
i defended my stepmother ih against the rest of my family immediately following my father is death because there was uh some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother so my sister and i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family stepmother eventually shafted us and so stepmother is evil 

Recording: (4038/ 9618) 
right and then they wonder whyuh you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that will goldend rule thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it 

Recording: (4039/ 9618) 
play lottery once in a while if i have a couple bucks on me and uh well football games we will not even start with that

most of them at our sigte now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect others people connect us and then go out it is a gateway to other places you know we are getting more into that now but that was not easy so easy before either the you know the webicand 

Recording: (4079/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (4080/ 9618) 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so you know wand i mean basically all  all i have ever seen is a lot like the ise kids at get ting the house they go to their house they find a gun n then they want to hold the parents a responsible yes and now on that if the parents had the gun in the house and they had to uh ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car w what if the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and pick the gun lock off the gun 

Recording: (4081/ 9618)

yem 

Recording: (4083/ 9618) 
i am just saying you know 

Recording: (4084/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4085/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (4086/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4087/ 9618) 
like little puppoos 

Recording: (4088/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (4089/ 9618) 
they were all around the same age you know ind going to college my daughter juili does uh is very active thouh in um not necessarily that she has adopted to her two children so she is become very active in the adoption procedure in talsa and uh 

Recording: (4090/ 9618) 
but our belief is that it did not it it needed to be restored and and we believe i do not know if you have heard about josife smith or 

Recording: (4091/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4092/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4093/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4094/ 9618) 
that would be fine but again i do not it is just another person with a different life style it is like they are they are they are the same as me it is just 

Recording: (4095/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (4096/ 9618) 
no i just uh basically got out of a a a relationship it was like a rebound type thing um i was in ah relationship for like three years and um he was cheating on me and so i felt really bad and why did yhou pick her and moe and then i met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful 

Recording: (4097/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4098/ 9618) 
uh dwar the fourth 

Recording: (4099/ 9618) 
theyhad on the news most people keep a house five to seven years beore they sell it and move on 

Recording: (4100/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4101/ 9618) 
uh i would either go back in uh languages or actually i am a pychology ingrit so yeah 

Recording: (4102/ 9618) 
because like i think it is archy griffin that went to a realla crummy school an o and and collumbus and to me no matter how bat of an area you live in and about a bad to school you think you are going to if you want to do it you can because  and really in cumbus public schools if you have a learning disability or you know if you have problems reading or you have problems at home theyre is a sycholegist or a tuter or something to help you and and ind uh like wore thing tin anf westervill to hublan you know they do not have the money to throw way and lik cathlic schools theydo not have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get pushed aside and so you know ias you an say i am staying in my shot box here i do like columbus public schools but you know i i i hate when people say you know look at these test schoors because it really does not reflect what is there because it is like saying all kids carry guns to school they do not you know and the medea says well what is they are ben like maybe five or six people who have taken guns to school ando kill people well what about the uh millions and millions of kids that go to school every day do their home work and you know do community service and stuff well well at is just too boring hey d notwat to hear that stuff you know it is like that that irritates me 

Recording: (4103/ 9618) 
yeah we did a lot of searching when we bought our house you know it is hard to find what you want ind a house and get the school system to you get into arlingtong you get into grand view places like this or backtlly and the price range we were in you were going to have to dump fifty thousand into the housees just to get them up you know we had a list of what we wanted in a house and our house was only seventeen years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted fireplace full dry basement you know two and a halh yaur garage you know all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older housees wet bacemeit is garage burned down or you know the lots were packed so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the back yard and so it is really yeah they do not the they play ing tha crek they do not play golf yet 

Recording: (4104/ 9618) 
i do not know you know clummas is assocajeraterd with golf courses and my parents all through grown up they play golf and i really was interested in it um i just think enough is enough though i yeah uh there is so many but 

Recording: (4105/ 9618) 
i mean you could cut paper with this kind of rain  it is just coming down all over the place hail and lightning 

Recording: (4106/ 9618) 
yeah i take organic i have to take um biology chemistry physics and then um i have to complete a major if it is biology i get a break i do no i wond like to take twenty nine hours of it

Recording: (4109/ 9618) 
o clinton is position on it well he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hoped that it would drop and i mean when what you hear and read lately is that it really has not changed much uh and it but again that is i think part of that too is society is not ready iis some level to axcept that engaze in the military is one thing but thin people are talking about gay mariages and 

Recording: (4110/ 9618) 
correct 

Recording: (4111/ 9618) 
those are the mass people you got to find out and figure out what needs they are going to role into like when they get older you know you get into the wheel char companies or methg you nw somewhere it is just going to be massive 

Recording: (4112/ 9618) 
probably a little bit 

Recording: (4113/ 9618)

Recording: (4162/ 9618) 
yea 

Recording: (4163/ 9618) 
which i mean it is not necessarily a bad thing but i mean it is smething that is definitely noticable in there 

Recording: (4164/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4165/ 9618) 
i do not think that i would have them go to any i learned things like how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party that kind of stuff was a lot more focuse an than i mean i did not even i do not think anybody even taught me how to write an carsep other than my parents so i mean it was it it was interesting i mean it was a lot more coltural kind of kinds of things o do a lot of things with nature and in that kind ofit was the seventies too so i mean you have to look at the time what we are talking about but ive i feel like i do not see why i i would not sond them to public schools 

Recording: (4166/ 9618) 
do you 

Recording: (4167/ 9618) 
um uh the the the public transit system i mean i know they are doing the best they can but i do not see how we are ever going to get out of this without light rail and i am really bumped 

Recording: (4168/ 9618) 
yeah avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do better decisions that help 

Recording: (4169/ 9618)

Recording: (4171/ 9618) 
if there were any germans in there i will bet they e scared 

Recording: (4172/ 9618) 
yeah yeah  i do not see figure that out i think it is all i think it is all fixed 

Recording: (4173/ 9618) 
from high school and i one in that original group of kids that i had never did pass them all but i guess he is not worried because he is going to work with his dad and his dad is business so he is going to be okay but he never did pass the reading and the riting d he passed everything else but and the questions are not the same  i mean there ise several different forms every time they send out the test that is sealed in a box and nobody is allowed to open it but the principal and then he has to distribute it to the teachers and so the questions could change 

Recording: (4174/ 9618) 
do my um billing and stuff like ourself money 

Recording: (4175/ 9618) 
rght 

Recording: (4176/ 9618) 
uhum well then i think she probably took er girlfriends out to the mall you know and partyed a little bit with the mcdonalds and ertha that is one thing i sey about kids doing nowadays a lot too is uh socializing like at shopping math and   than things of that nature umhum 

Recording: (4177/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4178/ 9618) 
yeah hosyor  yeah so uh things pretty much in collumbicis public schools you know they do not they do not actually sit down with you they automatically assume that once you get to this level you are ready for this level and you go on 

Recording: (4179/ 9618) 
yeah i had a cousin that went on she she was in school for that and um as you could tell i like to do office work i 

Recording: (4180/ 9618) 
hat is what i was actually thinking of um where he takes the pictures on the corner 

Recording: (4181/ 9618) 
now and it was just taking her out of her you know where she you know youu grow up hearing those lyes and 

Recording: (4182/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (4183/ 9618) 
umhum yeah how appalling oh yeah yeah my my my mom especially is just like when are you going to stop doling that yeah because he is sixteen months now and i think he is tapering off quite a bit so i think that he will be done soon but i am not pushing him so 

Recording: (4184/ 9618) 
you should you should be organized i am not i have thi stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting next to my bed just when we went out and bought groceries and then the commons open again 

Recording: (4185/ 9618) 
i mean you just never know how freaky 

Recording: (4186/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4187/ 9618) 
i am sure yeah i mean i she he does not throw women in her facinga women call the house or anything but you never know what she does not you know question him about where he is been or anything like that and i she just i just can not believe that i just think that is terrible 

Recording: (4188/ 9618) 
oh that is it 

Recording: (4189/ 9618) 
it is it is it is a it is kind of a oasis in the middle of the city 

Recording: (4190/ 9618) 
yeah not me it is too expensive 

Recording: (4191/ 9618) 
it is more feasible than a six year old 

Recording: (4192/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4193/ 9618) 
yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (4194/ 9618) 
i have always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (4195/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4196/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (4197/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4198/ 9618) 
and they see the same thing it is meared back to them because we are made in christs images and we can not say no to him that is what heaven is like that is wat we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do posieday and build ing the ost it may have been the smallest part of that sheet of paper 

Recording: (4199/ 9618) 
but she was never interested in you are never really interested in boys or in sports and high school or make up and clothes and things like than you know you are setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that and ni sot himes she would come home in tears because e kids made fun of her and stuff and finally she just stopped going and within a couple months she got her gd 

Recording: (4200/ 9618) 
toter tottle mall around tettlemall thirteen years umhum umhum umhum uh i was going through divorce parents both parents passed away uh my ex moved toh stayin at lewise and did not tell me anything about there were four closeang on the house and that is how i found out tat she moved and just ah bunch of shet and i guess started uh skiring tup so they wanted to put me on probation in my uh brbelious attitude or whatever soid i quit it was pretty stupid really but 

Recording: (4201/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4202/ 9618) 
yeah they are they are really good about that 

Recording: (4203/ 9618) 
oay 

Recording: (4204/ 9618) 
those were the goodd days that is a go days that is when you used to own them too you could trade them that that iswhen whe lost hourt rights  there is some things therere traditional there are capital t and some are lot locaset and you are talking about lot caset i am talking about capital t 

Recording: (4205/ 9618) 
bye 

Recording: (4206/ 9618) 
i was going to then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh ut but that was one comment you wase talking about but then on the very very opposite exxtreme uh extreme opposite we talk about the love ofh the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i am not quite sure how to address that because yaukow inm some people would say now wemet you are talking out about both sidesof your mouth expression is how can you say over heare you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then overhear you are saying you believe ing capital punishment and electricution 

Recording: (4207/ 9618) 
i think example is probably the best uh they see that you care and they learne to care i think my son jon he is the youngest i think he is a very compasstionate sol uh very spiritual young man uh more so than his brother is and then i always have have to way that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel bhetter to give and i sometimes try to way that if thati part of why ii i i can not believe it is an attention getter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do but uh but maybe just within maybehe one feels uh and i think i think it it is a matter of being concientious to you know conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4208/ 9618) 
no 

Recording: (4209/ 9618) 
it is quite possible but we pick the day care that i thought was closest to wem the one that was open that had the closest values that we had um i personally wewuld like a church base program but there are not any there were not any open when we were looking for one um we did have the option ouf going here to oh isue to their day care and it has a wonderful reputation and everybody that ihave talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i did not like was so that they were not um imparting values on the children they do not celebrate any holidays at all so they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother is day card and i mean they are doing th chircker treat thing on thursday they are going door to door they get a dress up where he would not have gotten any of that at o issue and they are prosind cons to to both of those but 

Recording: (4210/ 9618) 
el it would be to getting a second job 

Recording: (4211/ 9618) 
like it is okay i mean it is like a country school which was always real weird too i was always likei mean like my friends were always like the because iy used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippy or whatever and like um that was i guess weird kind of like being the od people and a ind a small like in a small midwestern farmeing school  is kind of od i guess um on o um 

Recording: (4212/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (4213/ 9618) 
yeah i i i loved one sixty one i loved it around there i loved all those cool restaurants and everything 

Recording: (4214/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4215/ 9618) 
and getting back to the profanity and stuff that was another one was in the paper some of the parents are not leading the children right and it was about this mother and father was doing something  wall once ther little kid maybe six or seven reight walked innd there and said what the ech y  four letter word is this for and the father standing lookd atone and after the kids walked out and says morrer well where and the ah do that child learn to talk like that so yeu see he gave himself away right away so you see it is the it is the ones that are teaching the kids and itis it is all those things that i have mentioned before but i think that really it goes a back to that what can we do to change it i think as i said it basically everybody has to learn to think uh the other person and what is good for everybody not just me me me 

Recording: (4216/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (4217/ 9618) 
o know they can do whatever they want 

Recording: (4218/ 9618) 
the proficiency tests that they are now requiring you can not graduate from an ohio high school with a with a diploma unless you pass all the proficiency tests and that means you have to take one in citizenship which is like government and history one in math one in science one in writing and one in reading and you have you can try to pass the first time in the at the end of the eighth grade thend you get two tryes in the ninth grade two tres in the tenth doing the eleventh a to ing the twelfth you can take them as many times as you need to take them but if you do not pass them all by the time you graduate you get thes niffty little thing called an attendant cirtificaut it is not a real diploma it is like okay i attended i did not learn anything but i was there

right yeah the middle of may is when they usually start most of this stuff heating cooling and ventilation umhum 

Recording: (4318/ 9618) 
i have become visually dicensatized to like the violence that i see in movies and on tv but i still see a distinct difference between that and real violence um i mean in studying history i am exposed to a number of like rather grewsome events in history that still are very i still find disturbing um a uh also hang out in low life bars and every once in a while ther will be a fight and it it is still it i meani it it is still is disturbing to me i i i ihave a distinkt difference in my head between reality and fiction and maybe kids like are not making that distinction but i i do not think so and i think if if some one is not making that distinction it is i do ot now that tat they are not oh i   i do not know i do not have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have a i feel that i have a distink it just a a very clear distinction between what is uh fact in what is fection what is true and what is imaginary and uh so for me i do not think that television has affected me in that way um i mean one way that t like television has affected me is i am full of media referencees when i speak you now whe i am hanging out withfriends some anmentions uhh a subject i mean like hay sympsonis made fun of thatyou know it  some point uh i that is the effect that it sees on me i do not think that is too big an effect people are always usedtoyou know like quote shaxpeere or something  i guess that is ten times more elevated so like uh but ah referencees tha shaxepeere line or something but i mean it it is a part of our culture and i am a part of it and 

Recording: (4319/ 9618) 
but we are working on it we have got a couple of house bills in right now and see how things go 

Recording: (4320/ 9618) 
yeah i and i i guess i guess i just felt like i do not know bes it is kind to i me i i  think o that is kiding me and if you are looking at traffic and and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back the amount of money that you pay to park downtown is outrageous um even just having tot takes i know when it is when it was snowing because i worked on i worked on front street and where i wa come from i lived on bathel road which is i would take bathol to three fifteen down through downtown and it would take me an hour an forty five minutes in the snow to get down there and if i could if i could jump on this rail system ind it would take me fifteen minutes and i would not have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking why why not do that and oh there is also the whoe pollution thing and and those types of thing so i thought that was 

Recording: (4321/ 9618) 
because of your internal clock 

Recording: (4322/ 9618) 
umhu 

Recording: (4323/ 9618) 
and uh my oldest son uh completed what they call a goddn country award in the church which is a a requires about as much work as the eagle award in the scouts it is uh a scout sponsered but church centered uh award and then my second son got a his egle award in the scouts i am kind of proud of that because it uh well it is not something that a lot of kids do you know 

Recording: (4324/ 9618)

Recording: (4472/ 9618) 
i was in seventy eight uh and then i have just iave stayed there and it is grown a lot and the work changes it is an interesting place to work because uh well first the job is almost a different job every year becaus so many changes are happening we are trying to stay out in front of what yiund front of what library innovations in front of web and net innervations and trying to incorporated allso it is it i you know it i kind of exciting because you are getting in on things that are really new and trying to master the project i am working on now uhis trying to fingd a way to autom to create data that describes weab resources so that liboraes can take this data and put itin teir catalog and in to greateit with the regular collection uh we are doing a lot of with hat yeah it is it is pretty it is pretty neat project a lot of new things the uh jova and the web give us opportunities to do things that we have talked about befor but could not really do very well so it is pretty neat 

Recording: (4473/ 9618) 
for people to read i think there is enough other resources out there if somebody is interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that um i know for for me just because i have so many younger brothers and sisters and and my family and everything i know how i have got some some some what i feel irae pretty good opinions about how to handle different things and i know that my mom always consults me you know like my sister you know she got e the dinfrents which vanesa is just she is this girl is almost creaapy she is so bright i mean she really is i mand it is one of those things where she just does not turn in her stuff you know and itis she is twelve

true communism not as it was practiced in russia but uh where people uh share and uh share power and share money and equally buthe where we are in our evolution we are not ready for it i actually i when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an ententional community which was actually trying 

Recording: (4492/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4493/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (4494/ 9618) 
oh okay 

Recording: (4495/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4496/ 9618)

Recording: (4498/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4499/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (4500/ 9618) 
there generally tends to be at least one or two republicans i vote for each eaeach election o sometimes i voted straight democrat because i just you know i even voted for dorthy teeter the first time she ran for county commissioner uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and i i liked what she was saying but then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i i did not vote for her after that but the first time she ran for  county commissioner i did it one because she was a woman and i liked you know i it was not possible i would like to vote for women 

Recording: (4501/ 9618) 
and i had two little girls and i thought wait a minute you know i my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to you know get all the opportunities that were out there for them and and it just did not happen that you know  that we both had the same he wanted everything to be the same you know so i think that really changed  everything was not going no it does your whole focus changes because everything you say somebody is listening and everything you want to do somebody is watching and 

Recording: (4502/ 9618) 
kay you ae kin 

Recording: (4503/ 9618) 
yeah well you get these you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the east side and then you got all these people you know i have been in the fights in my neighborhood and well my old neighborhood and you know fights people breaking in stealing your stuff and just all out outlandish behavior i mean i caught i actually wrode up on uh couplef people down the street from meu having sex through a fence 

Recording: (4504/ 9618)

Recording: (4512/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (4513/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (4514/ 9618) 
i think i like if you had to ask i would say i was a straight midwestern suburban i but there are people that i go to school with and ashlan is twenty five thousand like in the city 

Recording: (4515/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4516/ 9618) 
it it does not have to cost anything but you you can go do it with your family or whatever so yeah 

Recording: (4517/ 9618) 
schoolboard they are always stopping something and they do not seem to move forward very well 

Recording: (4518/ 9618) 
no i do not either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel taking a life like that leaving someone there just to die 

Recording: (4519/ 9618) 
and she went back to the 

Recording: (4520/ 9618) 
hat woul be two hundred dollars a month 

Recording: (4521/ 9618) 
they really have no self worth because you know uh i know a long time ago i we went to a um uh wat was it is like a a semonar for the ivy league schools which i looked at their tuition and went you know there was no way but and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man the there was like fourh or five men talking and some women talking whatever and uh they said you know if you are if you are child make straight as and uh applies at our school we do not want them and i am like what he says uh he says we look at two two children stting aside beside this one is making straight ays this ones sort of made bes but this one over here got into track when he or she was in freshman s and and we noticed every track me they basically with were like last or second to last but they did it for four years then they 

Recording: (4522/ 9618) 
bein goopy 

Recording: (4523/ 9618) 
ou know  stuff like that is always been around but it seems now that the guns are more you can get them easier well it is like me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they going to do to me 

Recording: (4524/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4525/ 9618) 
so yeah i think um as a whole we have all kind of gone our separate ways which is scary i mean we do not have the same belief system and anything anymore so it is kind of like oh jeez 

Recording: (4526/ 9618) 
ifthey 

Recording: (4527/ 9618) 
and the safety of the neighborhood and yeah there there are a few things really that go into it 

Recording: (4528/ 9618) 
do you really 

Recording: (4529/ 9618) 
around more than somebody else 

Recording: (4530/ 9618) 
no i think that there as four kids at least among my grandchildren are getting pretty much at the same training that i did or maybe better than i got uh my oldest son is two daughters are well they are good kids and they are smart kids but i do not think that they have theh moral grounding that uh grig and biths kids do you said this is all confidential 

Recording: (4531/ 9618) 
they 

Recording: (4532/ 9618) 
and move on um that is that is basically my feer but uh as one of the guys tryid to help me he said well listen i am afraid to that too so because right there in that pit there that is got ow if you remember that there is nothing in here that can hurt you even as hot as it gets you know and when you think about that you try not to think too much whyy youare in there although it is hard to do especially if you are thinking about how hot it is but if you are listening to people praying and they are praying with their heart and i tell you because of how hot it gets in there you will hear people pray straight from their heart not a bunch of real fancy words and ind a real comfortable satting you know that that heat 

Recording: (4533/ 9618)

Recording: (4540/ 9618) 
yeah yeah yeah 

Recording: (4541/ 9618) 
no i never did i i do not know any people that do but but it was also for me i think if i know something is true i i just know it and then as long as it keeps on being true over and over n if it is not just some exciting thing that for one day it is like oh this is great but like six months later it still has the same still ringing true and a year later two years later then that is what  feel 

Recording: (4542/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4543/ 9618) 
um i just think it is uh horribly biased paper they do not really take their uh what is it uh the journalistic like unbiased integraty they do not take that seriously 

Recording: (4544/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (4545/ 9618)

Recording: (4575/ 9618) 
things when we were north africa there was one german gun that was fired on us and they could not figure where he was 

Recording: (4576/ 9618) 
you mean to do it you 

Recording: (4577/ 9618) 
exactly 

Recording: (4578/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4579/ 9618) 
yeah i think so um met quite a few people from cleaveland and then my roommateis from north canton 

Recording: (4580/ 9618) 
mother e used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh he is like i i think we should talk it was like okay i great because i was like a  bo you are weight too serious for this particullar therge that is mne but we knew ahead of time thesas all s or coming to in hat dory about it so i i um at this point in thestory i hashould point out that the paper that i went down stairs for i do not know where that is i never found it never saw i t and never it it is anyway not realy bin an all of the story but it bugs me every time i told the story because does not exist anyway so on we come back inside and it is like well i have got some bad news and my sister is like wik uh like uh okay go ahead and he wis like now i i think you should sit down and i am likea al right 

Recording: (4581/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4582/ 9618) 
we have uh yeah wve 

Recording: (4583/ 9618) 
the erbs  the herbs 

Recording: (4584/ 9618) 
i used to when i was driving now uh especially when i was going through the uh going to two seventy things you know i v had people flip me off and stuff like that and id f  funny thing one time aothe guy flipped me off because he was going slow and uh i got off pissed off about hitm  ad went around him and everything you know and i go to work point and action chemical and whe pull him beside me but him i look over at him and he looked at me like o i am sorry i mean you know the other 

Recording: (4585/ 9618) 
mhum yeah it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might ave not 

Recording: (4586/ 9618) 
i think more what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns oare that are involved in shootings and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean lke people like the asian countries places like that i meani really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism yourself serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it i meani some cases it will even chain you up in beacan public for it um and i think not to sound too ventul but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it um i think just the fact the the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that theyare goingto get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you are you are not even goingno get thirty days in jail and you are gong to be like go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (4587/ 9618) 
i am just more of a conservative person i mean i am not sure exactly what his platform is but i have seen him speak a couple times and i do not know he just impresses me more than algor 

Recording: (4588/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4589/ 9618) 
well it was rough 

Recording: (4590/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (4591/ 9618) 
that is probably what i will do ignore it tutil like august or july and then start paying attention 

Recording: (4592/ 9618) 
i mean there is always been the nerds and um i do not know when i was grown up in the seventies there really was not punk or o anything like that and i think um unfortunately i mean there is lways going to be all different kinds of people to make the world but it they just pushed it to an extreme certain kinds of kids and you know they want to i saw you know i watch all these shows dat line ind twnty twenty and all this informent ofe shows and how one was in texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by uh um a jock 

Recording: (4593/ 9618) 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage so that is where they ment  no huh uh i i oud come down here two or three times like you know just trips through going to the airpourt and other missilanious things but um when i moved to the city i mean it it was a real big change because i have you know used to living in the country and then i moved into smackdab in the middle of a downtown area 

Recording: (4594/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4595/ 9618) 
ll i m not sining byh 

Recording: (4596/ 9618) 
it is that is weird 

Recording: (4597/ 9618) 
yep 

Recording: (4598/ 9618) 
ell i mean to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if you are guilty or innocent theyre to me there is wor t worse things i would think than than dying you know o you like i know in isral the guy who killed yisacrubin he got locked up and he is not allowed to see it because  um under jewish law you can not kill 

Recording: (4599/ 9618) 
and i have a wife been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven both of them one is in second grade and the other one is still in day care at ohio state university

Recording: (4650/ 9618) 
nd they had a strong uh public uh support over there it is u really tight inhe community it is uh quite different clummus needs to learn a lot from the area and uh and is is a matter of just uh putting  i guess your handis in the you are practicing your faith which we 

Recording: (4651/ 9618) 
opento that tonnel and they fired a couple of our shells into the tounnel and then took off 

Recording: (4652/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4653/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4654/ 9618) 
well 

Recording: (4655/ 9618) 
umum 

Recording: (4656/ 9618) 
yeah so you know his friend lives on the other sideyou know it is like a duplex and his friend lived on the other side and he uh he also was uh broken into but they came through his bathroom window 

Recording: (4657/ 9618)

Recording: (4658/ 9618) 
and that is so sad for our city 

Recording: (4659/ 9618) 
um so they are coming up and uh there is been like divorced papers and stuff on you know and i know that police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents i do not personally think tha divorced documents or that important but nothing is beyond the rell of possibility for people o take things a way out to way too seriously  yes 

Recording: (4660/ 9618) 
well see we have real traditional um breakdown of of chorse but only because ha that is just happene to be what we like to the way we like it you know what i mean and it is it is not um because you know i consider i my whole house all lot of feminists you know we are all real strong about that but the thing is since i have the luxury of being at home and peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and i am doing something i enjoy i really am happy to do all of those things that typically women do because that is my job that is my trade off you know i do not have to go some place else i can get i can go and have coffy every day with my daughters i can go you do whatever i want and i am happy to do these other things 

Recording: (4661/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4662/ 9618) 
i think that step would be really fun i have never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 

Recording: (4663/ 9618) 
yeahmedicad i think i think it is 

Recording: (4664/ 9618) 
every day the other one i do not see that much anymore 

Recording: (4665/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (4666/ 9618) 
i do not think that would change my mind about anything i mean i do not approve of his immoral behavior but it does not change the way he runs the country 

Recording: (4667/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4668/ 9618) 
yeah i contribute it to too many people there is too many people there is not enough commitment it is too easy to get divorced and uh the competition i mean there is just tons and tons of um just people everywhere and young people today i do not i you know i do not know what the statistics are going to be but they i do not think they have a good idea of what mariage even is you know before and also before marriage was a commitment to uh a type of life style and that life style is gone everybody is independent everybody is going their own ways and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and as equally as independent then tit might it might work but um i you know and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual situation and uh 

Recording: (4669/ 9618) 
oh that is great 

Recording: (4670/ 9618) 
exactly 

Recording: (4671/ 9618) 
it just just kind of instinks i guess yeah actually there are kind a there is a a a well pretty well nown doctor that has a ton of books and i go to lalaca leagu and that is kind of their philosophy in a way yeah just that breas feeding is you know a way to mother and nurture and feed and you know it it meets all of these need it is kind of like it is just yeah umhumhuumhum oh i believe it umhum yeah well one of my lilachleague leaders she has a pahd and she does a lot of reading and she said that she actually wrote a study that they did um from brass fed babies to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their icu is equivalent to a a regular bottle fead baby and a baby exposed to lod poisoning it is that much higher even so i mean it is just given them that much of a tat ar had start on development so 

Recording: (4672/ 9618) 
yeah but um some names are just like we had a friend once that she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they did not ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy so she named the little girl after her mother and the mother is name was hariet 

Recording: (4673/ 9618)

Recording: (4698/ 9618) 
um college wise i do not know anyone of college age that is ay

i do not feel like i have gained anything from it that i did not deserve i mean 

Recording: (4700/ 9618) 
right she is woneer last year 

Recording: (4701/ 9618) 
yeah uh yeah for them to go to a d yeah mak i would think it for them to interact with the kids more yeah but where he goes there is he is got ill thise cousins and stuff that with them so 

Recording: (4702/ 9618) 
om 

Recording: (4703/ 9618) 
uhuh uh i have one daughter thirty six years old she lives in tolito and then i have two grandchildren 

Recording: (4704/ 9618) 
i 

Recording: (4705/ 9618) 
oh i have to eat i tat is like 

Recording: (4706/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (4707/ 9618) 
uhuh 

Recording: (4708/ 9618) 
and come back in 

Recording: (4709/ 9618) 
uh little bit north of north bradway right along the freeway there did not used to be a bad neighborhood but now it is just kind of you got the little kids growing up and doing shit that you know  you picture yourself doing as a child one way or another you know you know you throw rocks around and stuff an accidentally break a window run away 

Recording: (4710/ 9618) 
that is true sometimes we have trouble finding enough veolists or something you know an instrument like that um but they they we usually get enough to play concert sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for last few rehearsals um so we sort of have stringers i guess you would call  yeah we have actually been on doubos u also uh radio on music in mid ohio u our recording last year yeah of bathoven is ninth got on music in mid ohio  yeah we used to auterbine college quier m 

Recording: (4711/ 9618) 
well i would i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex you should get on some kind of birth control 

Recording: (4712/ 9618) 
yeah well like i i played music and stuff with a lot of my friends i do not know basically just like standard tnage stuff sitting around watching tv and like inot know just running around or whatever but like um  high school is always just real like like you know you put in like a tiney little bit of effort and you get like a be and that is and that is good enough i guess 

Recording: (4713/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4714/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4715/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4716/ 9618) 
sofhimore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master is 

Recording: (4717/ 9618) 
not yeah  o o 

Recording: (4718/ 9618) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sexs they are and they treat them well uh so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting them they obviously w know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (4719/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (4720/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4721/ 9618) 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4722/ 9618) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to 

Recording: (4723/ 9618) 
but it is mine boggling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high schools two football teams you know it is just min bogling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a handful of people and do not know anybody else like you know a lot more of a tight nit group as a child so we had three elementary schools ind one high school and that was it 

Recording: (4724/ 9618) 
because conceivably they wanted  what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (4725/ 9618) 
well but see i think if you really chary to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is loved and you know you should not do it 

Recording: (4726/ 9618) 
rightright well let me ask you uh about somebody else who is not that well known do you know jon gorka have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is he is funny has good songs he is a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arlo guthry or somebody i mean he he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does a costic and uh he writes most of his own songs yeah and the if you ever see something by him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection ask to listen to it he has funny funny some of the songs at e really funny and some of them are the saddest things you have ever heard yeah yea just just tragic things  um uh let us see fnny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cowsum let us see uh i can not think too mutch of them right now b uh yeah 

Recording: (4727/ 9618) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it whatnot and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrust back into it i do not think you can break free 

Recording: (4728/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4729/ 9618) 
riht 

Recording: (4730/ 9618) 
they have just gotten a lot worse like um my niece they my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when  husband was out in problems and my kniece is a eight well she was in fifth grade and there is a elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarets and everything and i  dus some like om y 

Recording: (4731/ 9618) 
all creation into religion all of what spirituality is into one word religion you you can not um but when you say it is a spiof spiritual nature that is you know that is still lev in the doore waid open that it is it is abroad it is pigger than you verme uh butthat uh that whole thing is um yu know the people of the land had am specific instructions of how to do things and i am not saying ey ver perfect either there ware a lot of indian people and there are a lot ofindian people lout there that are crooked as a dogs on leg that is just the way it is therer corrupt the money is corrupt amn the lack ofe money ws corrupted then power whas corrupted them uh they want to be a spiritual leader why i do not know u u  to me it is an ego thing and uh thers rainbo eith o guy had some cond of buffalo uh um whan you call a buffalo seramony but you charge  everybody thative people do not do that i mean traditional native people that you you do not charge pople that wan to come and learn about god there is some people in california that say certain seramoneies where ofe native thing and they berried a woman in the gruownd with tha straw tod her was some aritual of proving and over coming feer yoet the lady was an adismatic and she was costapobic in lost the straw in her mouth and i could no breath and breathed an all this staying and died and so the first thing they put in the paper is that arnother native seramoney shows is how native american spirituality should be outlawed and if you look at any kind of uh spirituality religion it is out there and native american is ell they ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can not have that there is blood quantums saying that if you have a fourth or  half 

Recording: (4732/ 9618) 
yeah the local ones more than anything uh 

Recording: (4733/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (4734/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (4735/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4736/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (4737/ 9618) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (4738/ 9618) 
by the time you get there you are all lagged out and 

Recording: (4739/ 9618) 
kid ae i have seen a few like imfoimercials on stuff like that uh but i can not say anything too serious just come up from it 

Recording: (4740/ 9618)

but he just did not have a very high opinion of the army 

Recording: (4745/ 9618) 
everybody ish 

Recording: (4746/ 9618) 
so um it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with people that are into capitalism have uh pretty good lives and they have what they want and they do not jut seem to have such serious problems h people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into big trouble so and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked uh and we are ahead of the world there is no question about that in what the individual people persons have and how their lives go much better on the other hand um you know i am i am actually what i would like uh if it would just spread all over the world true communism 

Recording: (4747/ 9618) 
of the people of this land tat there is in a a seramony called an inipie which is a sweat lodge and a lot of people talk about sweat lodge um it involves heating up stones in a fire and uh putting the stones in the lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs it is not a sonna it is not a uh steame room

yeah it is great you know and they like it they shing ion they you know interact with other kids and learne to use the library you know nowadays you know people do not go to the library s much eeither on the get your information off the internet or you buy books or you know yi you know so i just we have felt that if we yand introdoe sheme now that hopefully this will lead on later and we this way you can monitor their television we let them reant a couple movies here and there but we see what they ra dor you know take out compared to yeu nd of the cartoone network and all these greatand it is just cartoons jus seems so worthless nowadays but actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ant you know dafwy daf and the rod around or and these tof thays all it was was kill the faks you know the the so we ares ike wy we doid not know if we want to wat let them watch that eithers uh yeah they  and disney and disney is pretty strong i mean you know you think of disny and you think of kids but you still a lot of the stuff they put out it is pretty hard cor for five year old or somethi you know a lot of the dinasores and all kinds of stuff it is it is a violent nature so but you got o yif you balance it i think you will be all right oh yeah absolutely yeah it is tough sometimes  you know to read the paper at hemetm ya yeu  like the five year olds addicted to the tarsan and he likes tars an movie that was u is h yeah he wants to  we have kind of boy cht it is  the daughter wants to throw it away  never do not have to watch that again

Recording: (4760/ 9618) 
uhum 

Recording: (4761/ 9618) 
well i know but you know it it struck me as funny at the time because that is the way it was worded 

Recording: (4762/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4763/ 9618) 
um yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and and like and then i just like ended up with drawing because i would have like failed everything anyway but um yeah then i was living with my friend for a while um but and then like know  now me and her and my other friend live in down on mainor 

Recording: (4764/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (4765/ 9618) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how to how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have uh a day where  every one tlike the whole class as a class could go have a picknic like geting the practice football field and th it was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you know you s pend t  second hafe of the day just hanging out so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they were there to provide n education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in um and like it was getting and they had  like we are on thefront page of the accrambucan journal because they had ta lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought the the dogs through and they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs 

Recording: (4766/ 9618) 
they are prevented from doing much yeah yeah i yeah i just do not think that they can do much and i am i am sure it is very frustrating for them well and and i know it is i we had a friend who is was a teacher she just retired a couple  years ago  buta our age and uh it sai it is very different now uh you know it is she said it is scary going into the classrooms sometimes uh and before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something dont with it now you can not get back in on it 

Recording: (4767/ 9618)

Recording: (4799/ 9618) 
right so a lot of them already believe in that they have their own religion and they they are really faithful so that was the one of the main problems is that they um they had been so holding on to that for so long an it is so strong they do not want to let go of and then the men their problem was usually that they would drink a lot and

Recording: (4981/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (4982/ 9618) 
so there is there is no faulting mai meat for these folks but still there is nothing else to do and there is nothing creative n response to say to this experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you are kidding and then immediately folwing it on never mind pretend i never said that 

Recording: (4983/ 9618)

Recording: (4991/ 9618) 
that is cood 

Recording: (4992/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (4993/ 9618) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (4994/ 9618) 
like management 

Recording: (4995/ 9618) 
i 

Recording: (4996/ 9618) 
hum i joined up in ohio 

Recording: (4997/ 9618) 
the food service and she knows that they are really bad and that is really sad but  they are not doing anything about it 

Recording: (4998/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (4999/ 9618) 
right right well it is sort of a problem as well that you know dose i mean uh it seems you know from what i have read if you wanted to make a bomb it is fairly u uncomplicated you know so thatis 

Recording: (5000/ 9618) 
that is right in other words it is so much me anymore instead of us and we 

Recording: (5001/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5002/ 9618) 
yeah it does  it is not like a skilled profession to me i think 

Recording: (5003/ 9618) 
ut see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like theh the europeans doo i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they get the change that the euro changs and the busses and and and and just like the but just by personal car you can go you know across just going across the border you thin khat they can go visit uh you know countries like like it is so condensed but here it is like we got arosians and it is like we got of like fly so so i i think that is why like i think a europeans arre more ue much more cooler in that respect though they are much more cosmopolitan just because  they they they it is like it is no big deal fo for like somebody in yeurope to speak like seven languagees we here it is like you know yo get somebody over here who who can actually who actually nows english  you know  is like so that that is i think that s i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully 

Recording: (5004/ 9618) 
umhm 

Recording: (5005/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5006/ 9618)

Recording: (5010/ 9618) 
not so much old startract uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean i back when it was new i like the next generation but once deep space nnine came out andi had a gridier darcer story that was not so cooky cutter in fassion there was uh a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on this ship going ind facing bad the the characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw i as something that would be even griddier i they had the potential for for excellent inter character conflict but they glossed over all those immediately was in the first season um and that really bothered me and an it ultimately this story like they are trapped but they do not really persue like the issues of being separated from home and two factions that had 

Recording: (5011/ 9618) 
they settled in springfield ohio and then my mom met my father um he was from patascaa they met here at oisseue where they were going to college and they settled here in columbus

Recording: (5094/ 9618) 
there is one 

Recording: (5095/ 9618) 
and it never goes back to the way it was before  you just know that there is someone that is completely dependent on you for everything 

Recording: (5096/ 9618) 
uright if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat were i i think i alm was anybody can beat gore right now but you know in in in election time a weekend is a couple of centuries uh a year is an eon you know so anything ca happen between now and then but i think a dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and wi go with the moderate candidate um which is basically where clinton placed himself ind the two elections he ran in um most real democrats the wor and batye is of the world and many you know congressman and and senators dislike clinton because they they did not think he was democratic enough um i liked clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes and either party do not get elected and that if you want some mon that has your general interest at heart you have to find someone who is a moderate and can can kno appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went into tell them how to to put together a school leby campain that basically yoeu had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty percent of the people who were were for you we the yess votes thirty percent who are automatically against you thenovotes and thirty percent in between i told them ac nore ther no votes you know just just do not get them upset with you you do not want the you know working actively against you lock up your you are thirty that are with you  make sure you you know youdo something with them but this group the the middle thirties i colled them you had hem aage them and that is what clintaon did so well and that is what dol could have done i am not sure if jeorge dubbou is going to be able to uh because to get th th the nomination eventually he is going t comeout and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i am pro gun he is arty said the progun and that going against what most americans are saying dol i think represeted wheremost americanzar if you l look at appinion poles um so you know you have to find away  to to moderate that stante uh whether you ae republican ore a democrat 

Recording: (5097/ 9618) 
yeah if i had um if i had stayed for the i i did not graduate so if i wold stayed for the fourth year um when we did a lot weould do a lot of um uh uh making up a portfolio that kind of thing um i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i i would have i probably would have stayed but it was 

Recording: (5098/ 9618)

mhum 

Recording: (5103/ 9618) 
so and he 

Recording: (5104/ 9618) 
that is how i would like t to be 

Recording: (5105/ 9618) 
there did not used to be inspecially in restaurants and everything and now it is such a open market and they know that they have to accommodate every um body is taste you know i mean before know i would have to go into a restaurant anto saland baked potator you know i mean there is nothing really nothing unless i go to a buffe and then all the foods so cooked down i mean honestly you know it is like no nutritional value 

Recording: (5106/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (5107/ 9618) 
i like i know one of the poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that and i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it is ment to kill a rat obviously seems pretty dangerous 

Recording: (5108/ 9618) 
allright very good we are up pare ing the attic and the ink is freezing up on us 

Recording: (5109/ 9618) 
he has different levels of things that people need at different ages and things like that and you know and and at at forty you you think wow you know and heu really need to make a difference or do something and and i can see that because i have gone through all the phases that he is talking about so 

Recording: (5110/ 9618) 
drove me  say a few words for a posterity he would say and we thinkget uof here 

Recording: (5111/ 9618) 
u 

Recording: (5112/ 9618)

you know what ae you going to do you hit that kid you are going to jail 

Recording: (5116/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5117/ 9618) 
mhum 

Recording: (5118/ 9618) 
yeah i think the population um in a way but i think it also leaves it open for all the things uh having too many people in one area um i do not i do not know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i have been home i have been reading the paper a lot more and you know i am more aware of what is going on and i really uh am going to be some kind of activist for  um i do not know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentlemen is clubs and things like that i just i think that is going to be really bad for the kids and and everybody around um there is one off of uh bethel or know it solf of henders an cahoots and then there is the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and i caun no even believe they are like right across the street from each other you know and it is funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they let all that stuff so think it really affects it yeah try to go around   and until they make a woman is club so well not be real equal 

Recording: (5119/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (5120/ 9618) 
but they are uh because they are both government programs but yeah but i think like i said for the for the younger people because it is  because it is not their fault their parents can not get health health care so 

Recording: (5121/ 9618)

Recording: (5122/ 9618) 
so you have how many gits i 

Recording: (5123/ 9618) 
uh we have been very happy with the ose day care i do not know if you have any association withit but oh it is it is just unbelievable our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up til when she went to first grade and uh i mean when she got out of that day care she could read she could writ she could do computer you know you know it is an education it is not you know people you pay for it it is one of your hires but you know highere amount of money for 

Recording: (5124/ 9618)

Recording: (5125/ 9618) 
yeah it i you are right 

Recording: (5126/ 9618) 
that is all right okay 

Recording: (5127/ 9618) 
it felt innecent to me and i liked that um because all the other times where they have started to kiss it is always been like stereo typic romantic da di it it no and that is like wow two friends alone it is new year is perfect you know it was not it was not like they were going to jump in the sack or anything like that 

Recording: (5128/ 9618) 
really i do not know i mean i guess for me i i just i just think jason an i get along so wow you know and and we hve been together for about two years and i mean i i do not know i just i do i just i just really like her but i do not knowo feel a in ten years from now but it certainly there is a lot of things that that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about about different things and and we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him and um  his name was jacon two but he he drank a lot 

Recording: (5129/ 9618) 
that is true 

Recording: (5130/ 9618) 
oh really hatis ute 

Recording: (5131/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5132/ 9618) 
i get a lot of respect for the college kids the majority of them it iss it is other people do not have respect for 

Recording: (5133/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (5134/ 9618) 
and oh she is snapping she is pregnant back off you know it is like 

Recording: (5135/ 9618) 
oh no and than it turns out it was the the uh the faiceless alians set a trap for the for the guys and i did not like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it was not resolved the way that they set it up so i think that i mean we supposedly know about semanttha 

Recording: (5136/ 9618) 
it is not it is not because i i see where he is and he is really messed up and  i can not do anything for him but i have you know i have i am open to a relationship with them 

Recording: (5137/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5138/ 9618)

you walk in oh my you like oh my gsh  see so you know the fire on that huh 

Recording: (5140/ 9618) 
oh okay well the reason i asked was a it seems to me a lot of the impetice fo going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to sunday schoololol  starting asking questions about religion and you are saying well i suppose i could answer all these but  yeah 

Recording: (5141/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (5142/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5143/ 9618) 
well and i think it really it still goes back to the mom and the dad and and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy you know whould i act this way woith that make my mom and because until you are about five or four yheur parents are pretty important to you and what they think so that is when you know you have to instill that stuff you have to you know thh wellan they learne by watching you do it too i mean my son now i saw him when let us see hi was fifteen maybe he would run across the street when martha the eighty six year old lady across thestreet was trying to bring her garbage down he would seen me do thatgo oh let me get that four you martha she is got aurthriter she looks like she is going to fall she takes steps about this big and i have seen him do that 

Recording: (5144/ 9618) 
you know wash limited money and i live in a nice neighborhood i have lived there for eleven years i have never had any trouble whatsoever and uh the bus is right there and you know the only thing that bothers me is if i went uh you know go to a grocery store i got to go you know over to high street you know to clinton ville you know to the big bar 

Recording: (5145/ 9618) 
yeah you are always still going to have violence like when we were kids like me and you would meet we would get ing a fight and then after that we would be best of friends now you know i would be walking down the street and hel fourteen year old scare me to death right now 

Recording: (5146/ 9618) 
uh before we used to have a system that only people in the backroom of the library is connected to and it was all main frame and then people got pcs on their desk and suddenly the whole world if who could access any system and what they could do ont their desk changed uh and now we have gone more out into the public wo cand the public see and do it is not just for the people in the back room uh and then the w you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with librari s before now we are trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just c wants to connect to us 

Recording: (5147/ 9618) 
do not know i mean i was actually looking at that rizer military and then they started popping up all this abuse stuff and i was like man darn it like my aunt 

Recording: (5148/ 9618) 
yeah over the years we have had situations like that you know af pregnancy here and there r things that people needed toi get worked out or someone being worried about  u a a neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with about it so yeah but you know i it is i am just lucky i am so lucky 

Recording: (5149/ 9618) 
oll they will susspend you 

Recording: (5150/ 9618) 
hum 

Recording: (5151/ 9618) 
i started at the real bottom of it

yeah i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that so 

Recording: (5153/ 9618) 
yeah it was litl had aa little gimnasium in it

Recording: (5166/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (5167/ 9618) 
in can get aggravating and when you get to be older you know the some of those issues  can be very aggravating 

Recording: (5168/ 9618) 
ecause they are they have enough money to buy new things and they do not want to necessarily send it down i do not think to the salvation army or the i i do not know but i think that they think that there is a better way of giving away and like good will they resell and salvation army they resell well we we 

Recording: (5169/ 9618) 
um no which is i am very grateful he did like go past my harn parents house and things like that but then they moved here and even though it is public records like who owns a house um luckily we have not had that because we purchased the house my husband like before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name on it but uh no luckily

Recording: (5178/ 9618)

how to uh step by step of how to commit suicide and yeah they have to be responsible i think because you know you put an idea into somebody is head and then when you give them the resources to carry thos those things out i think it iis it has to be responsible for a lot of it 

Recording: (5230/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5231/ 9618) 
and i think that sometimes they do not even count all the votes or something and sometimes that they really want ed to gog through bad enough even though the majority voted not for it i mean even though the majority does not want that to happen  somehow or othether they all count it so it did or they will you know ow that is

if you just look at the nature of what they are doing it is just 

Recording: (5233/ 9618) 
do not know if they still do that was a long time ago that is always kind of been known for that you know 

Recording: (5234/ 9618)

Recording: (5278/ 9618) 
but i mean i honestly do think i would at least go to church on occasion if it was not forced on me i mean it just got sort of just to the point of being ridiculous going seventeen eighteen years every single week

Recording: (5383/ 9618) 
that is it 

Recording: (5384/ 9618) 
that should not be on the other hand i would hate to see a thirteen year old have a baby because she was afraid 

Recording: (5385/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5386/ 9618) 
yell i do not i hear some of that from gor but not as much 

Recording: (5387/ 9618) 
it is a cartoone i believe it started out 

Recording: (5388/ 9618) 
oh ws there was a lot of discouraging things just i mean i learned so much it and it was not always just people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times 

Recording: (5389/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (5390/ 9618) 
there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it 

Recording: (5391/ 9618) 
against thim in a lot of ways 

Recording: (5392/ 9618) 
of the times and memories and stuff 

Recording: (5393/ 9618) 
and that is where the ohio state player i do not know if you know this they stay there every night for a game i mean it is the most expensive hotel in collumbus all the players stay there but to my amasement they come down for a uh i think they have a dinner then they come down for midnight snack andit is so funny all these guys come down in their shorts and stuff 

Recording: (5394/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5395/ 9618) 
i think that is kind of nice 

Recording: (5396/ 9618) 
i 

Recording: (5397/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5398/ 9618) 
raised eleven 

Recording: (5399/ 9618) 
just like 

Recording: (5400/ 9618) 
about two and two and a half years ago 

Recording: (5401/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (5402/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5403/ 9618) 
in a heartbeat try and help them but they do not i do not think they make an effort to like put out any you know 

Recording: (5404/ 9618) 
the majority of the ones that do not get the guidens at home that you are trying to reach hing will go to boy scouts 

Recording: (5405/ 9618) 
they are they have a very nice standard of living all of them do 

Recording: (5406/ 9618) 
and so they offered to move them back 

Recording: (5407/ 9618) 
now people like that can not work when i was a kid your family took care of you there was not welfare and stuff like this but you do not have a family structure no more 

Recording: (5408/ 9618) 
a parakeet yes little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 

Recording: (5409/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5410/ 9618) 
nw if they start running those campeins owd then i will kind of kind of read up on it but i have not have not really 

Recording: (5411/ 9618) 
oh yeah and that is normal we understood that we ouknow we knew at a lot of stuff we were going to we raised him to be very independent and i always said that we are going to regret this someday i said another ten years we will be pleased but uh we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent uh so i guess o the point that when we were first married pretty it was hard to make a de simple decision on anything you know if we have worked through that after twenty five years but uh or to stand on our own on anything but you know we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independent we it was sait stubbern but it is like even go to mcdonald is or something and he was did not want onions on anything he if he ordered a uh happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as six and seven years oldn tell him 

Recording: (5412/ 9618) 
yeh 

Recording: (5413/ 9618) 
oh my gosh they just 

Recording: (5414/ 9618) 
nop i met him through a friend i met him through his brother was dating my best friend 

Recording: (5415/ 9618) 
yeah he is reallygood 

Recording: (5416/ 9618) 
i think it would 

Recording: (5417/ 9618) 
yes and that is what i like 

Recording: (5418/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5419/ 9618) 
hit the mark sometimes so  he gets to clean the toylet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (5420/ 9618) 
anything else is a hardware failure and youwo have to go fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know how to put an operating system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do probale rmember wonin playing with computers for most people as being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (5421/ 9618) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (5422/ 9618) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (5423/ 9618) 
likeoh for normans well our basic um real fundamental belief is that tha church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was um the the same church that crist set up when he was on the earth with the twelve appossls and but  after crist died that the authority was taken from the earth to um have those appossles and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same catholic and o all the orthodox churchs still carried all these beliefs 

Recording: (5424/ 9618) 
um no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5425/ 9618) 
yeah not not for special conditions nothing just universally it is wrong 

Recording: (5426/ 9618) 
oh i think i i would do it in a minute but my family does not want it thel my husband thinks we are fine he does not want any more around and all my kids are so used to all their own 

Recording: (5427/ 9618) 
and until that consumer becomes on the equal knowlege level as them uh it is always going to be inequiable and you are going to have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the developer something well let us seewellwell we can make condo it is downside letle bt t stil we want to make this we wiant to make this margine of profit yeah we do wel what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (5428/ 9618) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy 

Recording: (5429/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5430/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5431/ 9618) 
yeah it is but see i have always i i have one in floors where i live now i vacume them i mean i am just the type you know i did not want pet hair and 

Recording: (5432/ 9618) 
but yeah i in discipline she is not she is not as strict as i am i do not 

Recording: (5433/ 9618) 
o i do not know  i am sure it would happen because there is all kinds of wacky people out there  seriously i do not know i have family members that are homeosexual that is just my own personal thing beliefs i do not know i think that is they should not have taken it off of the dum a whatever it was  i do not know 

Recording: (5434/ 9618) 
yeah youhv you follow this script d that is real funny too like you know you get um they they listen to you like they monitore the calls and um you know they listen to you and it is like this sheet like if you asked for the specials and like if you you know set it in this way like if you used this or whatever you know yo n like um iud not know it is just real weird 

Recording: (5435/ 9618) 
oh i do not it is so much fun 

Recording: (5436/ 9618) 
o 

Recording: (5437/ 9618) 
it is just like you people you see go to church ti walk out of church and see somebody sitting there that is homeless 

Recording: (5438/ 9618) 
gay people are straight people so 

Recording: (5439/ 9618) 
yeah when i first went to oberland i was a performance major in french horn and looking back on it i wish i whould maybe thought to major in music education or at leastt have a little bit of background in that because i am thinking it would have given me a little more dimention in terms of my my teaching possibilities and um although i am certified to teach now in chemistry and uh earth science uh it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 

Recording: (5440/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5441/ 9618) 
right yeah 

Recording: (5442/ 9618) 
umhum i just got done doing some rogfing and i was supposed to meet my girlfriend out there she never did show up so i had to walk from incredible where you are incredible university used to be we will just say hilliyard and two seventy all the way back this way on campus without water  talk about being stuck in a desert 

Recording: (5443/ 9618) 
just at home i just have a tape that i use it is cathy smith one of her things that i really like 

Recording: (5444/ 9618) 
i answered it right 

Recording: (5445/ 9618) 
person i she is pretty high up i guess i was  unaware 

Recording: (5446/ 9618) 
but i managed to get that much information out so te other cop goes upstairs and cristrisas interpretation of the story at this point is one moment i am cherefully playing on the computer and the next moment i i i turn arond there is a large police officer in the door wat of your room he said hi  he said i think yau should come downstairs e do not o ol kiss anything so crist comes downstairs and he stands beside me 

Recording: (5447/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (5448/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5449/ 9618) 
i do not argue with them i do not debate it it is just like it might 

Recording: (5450/ 9618) 
and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively i think so yeah oh yeah umhum umhum umhum i know  umhum that is another thing i forgot to mention umhumexactly just from family  yeah umhum oh yeah yea but something i have learned just from the other parents well mostly mothers that i you know talk to is that you know if it is not necessary to say it then it is necessary not to say it so it is just kind of uh in your home type a thing and you do not really go around say and yeah we sleep in the sem bit and we brest feed still and you just kind of f they ask you like yeuh well yeah that is just the way we are doing it so 

Recording: (5451/ 9618) 
no thit is real like to live off campus you have to well after my class it will be twenty two and senior credit status but my class was twenty one or senior or senior credit so i got to move off campus but like had i been a year younger i wuld not havebeen able to because i have to wat n till twenty two so therei 

Recording: (5452/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5453/ 9618) 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then then she can take the boy over to te day care and then they are only there five hours or so 

Recording: (5454/ 9618) 
yeah and i am closer to the ones that thatfeel the same way i do about things my oldest sister you know i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i do not stay on very long with her 

Recording: (5455/ 9618) 
and uh well she i the the people that own it are starting to build it up now but it is been like that it was the first department community uh in columbus it was built in thirty eight i guess 

Recording: (5456/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (5457/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5458/ 9618) 
or some kind of tax program 

Recording: (5459/ 9618) 
now it is it is kind of like um you go to private school and you get there maybe seven years old going up to fifteen sixteen and it sixteen they can actually determin give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things and sixteen fifteen sixteen year old kid actually graduate from college i know beg yeah they have they have showed that study already i mean i think it is i think it is amazing yeah i mean when i first heard about i said know some digy housers shit you know but now it is just you know now it i kind of reality you know because i know pretty much a lot of skilled skilled trades i know how to cook pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness  i mean you know go up on nature hikes and go fish and all that stuff just combines in the one it is all about being an individual and if those teachers can not study with that individual know what that indivitual wants young then older kid s not gong to know what to do and up practicing law and not like an  going t all that school for 

Recording: (5460/ 9618) 
is  but it was interesting uh they did have uh assemblies where they they had religious assemblies uh religion was not uh all in it was not all invaesive in this school but they did have ascemblies and uh for religious holidies in that kind of thing and i remember f thenking u it is it is interesting they the conceptive eating somebody is flesh and blood  as almost cult like  and i am thinking iam starting to think well w really separates ah a religion from a cult  and  i think it is just the the social acceptance of it really almost uh you know how many people are in it probably  what number divides them i am not really sure  yeah yeah uh well i i like uh i was i have been very politically active at various times in my pains and uh especially i guess in the late seventies ind early aighties i was very active ind u alternatife energy fighting against nucliar pwer and uh have been active at various times and animal rights movements and uh political campaigns uh foreign policy kinds of debates at kinds of that kind ofthing and one thing that i have noticed uh a lot is there are a lot of there are well there are there is a vide spectrum but in the uh there are a lot of liberals in the catholic church too   you know tha 

Recording: (5461/ 9618) 
uh we were floating around just did not know if they were going to send us in or not because it was toward the end of it

i think that uh i it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5502/ 9618) 
boy it would have to be um something that i actually enjoy um what happened was ever since i came to collumbus almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that uh because my husband works for the state  obviously he is not going anywhere um so i got tired of that and that is why i kind of went to tumping and stuff so it would be one with ah variety um i am unfortunately i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff but that does not get to express my creative sidt as much so it would be u my favorite job was one where i did the accounty but i dealt with people as well and like we would do presentations at sumon ours and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (5503/ 9618) 
and it is you know my mom you know she always sas wll what is you know what do you think i hould do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (5504/ 9618) 
at our desk we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (5505/ 9618) 
now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (5506/ 9618) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5507/ 9618) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (5508/ 9618) 
you know they should not know where the kees are if theye were kees to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that you know how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (5509/ 9618) 
which was scheduled in the evenings when i was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5510/ 9618) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5511/ 9618) 
axlis is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5512/ 9618) 
hokay 

Recording: (5513/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (5514/ 9618) 
my boy frend would love to mess with this i just wantd you to know that he would be likeenge taking it apart putting it back together 

Recording: (5515/ 9618) 
according to that and so uh i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5516/ 9618) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5517/ 9618) 
they go she is got it and they on to thenext guy and then all of a suden you are going aoff this woye they go uh that is nice juliet uh where are you going and you are like uh uh youh tol me uo and then they go oh brother you know so now you know attention is diverted to you so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there realy professional yeah and 

Recording: (5518/ 9618) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaaded them on okay i i just have a question isd you is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5519/ 9618) 
you know u my parents never did because um they knew i was always level headed i always had a lot of boyfrends you know but i always i always felt like i was waiting for the right one 

Recording: (5520/ 9618) 
is that right 

Recording: (5521/ 9618) 
i mean instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5522/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (5523/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5524/ 9618) 
like i said i have been here twenty five years i have seen a lot of weird stuffh fact is when i was a bigger iave seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 

Recording: (5525/ 9618) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5526/ 9618) 
yes to but that more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh uh maybe even today it is less than that because it is been a because of a loss of a parent thor inability of a parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes  those things do exist and they wa always have some but that is a very small percentage those got 

Recording: (5527/ 9618) 
t does not matter how much money they are given for their education they 

Recording: (5528/ 9618) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5529/ 9618) 
uh we are plano moving in the spring 

Recording: (5530/ 9618) 
well number one it is a little bit smaller more controled area quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to the sister you know my sister lives up here she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having all the peace peace and quiet she wants you know plus and a place that is only year old 

Recording: (5531/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (5532/ 9618) 
um just to get into the school there is about thirty people applying they let three in 

Recording: (5533/ 9618) 
yeah that could be rought yeah 

Recording: (5534/ 9618) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again it is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bartender responsible but so you could come up i  give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5535/ 9618) 
all the cool appartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (5536/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5537/ 9618) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening an a certain areayou know with you know very high unemployment like councel councel states um you know this sort of stereo type you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have lods of boy friens and girl friends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls that i have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted on thing to love oryou know we were bored so we decided to have ex and i mean i find ed just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed wish tang oh you know he wuld you know slept with like tten girls or something i athinking oh my gos you know ind these thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but in my oppinion the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kidy even if they are not f workyu knage they get like at and a certain amount of money and then once they ret i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby there providea thei re the top of the list for a counsele house so they get theire own there was actually a long documents ararouwnd before i left um you know of this girl who wis constantly fighding with her parents and you know  parents where at the end of theire a she got pregnant and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to move out becaute she gets her own place she gets money for herself money for bayby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know what more could she want you know wats basically what she was saying i have got my own place i can do what ever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so  that i think is a very bad sitshuation because they are almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5538/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (5539/ 9618) 
because i had a lot of frustration built up what is next  get a whole list there 

Recording: (5540/ 9618) 
so they built one out in hilliard 

Recording: (5541/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5542/ 9618) 
u know and without a health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assuming you were eighteen you could get a job like and try and pay for your health insurance i mean it i am not sayig it would be easy but still 

Recording: (5543/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5544/ 9618) 
yeah  and then you can stay as long as you want you do not you know feel obbligated and everybody just brings in food you know everybody brings their own stuff and it is fun i mean yeah it is from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it is just nonstop family everywhere so it is fun 

Recording: (5545/ 9618)

Recording: (5552/ 9618) 
they are five hours from colorado so they still bad lands are not too far away and i guess it is like nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back so they come at least once twice a year back to ohio 

Recording: (5553/ 9618)

Recording: (5555/ 9618)

i 

Recording: (5559/ 9618) 
yeah she went down to western missouriy 

Recording: (5560/ 9618) 
no no in fact the principal one she interviewed me asked me that and i said when we are raised in the unitarian sunday school it is ah it is almost an indoctrination in tolerance for other eligions  so you are better off with me than somebody that believes theirs is the only one true religion 

Recording: (5561/ 9618) 
wa some gosip the gosip i heard was that uh um the superintendent at school said that if he was elected she was goin to resin and so they gave her a big rase  he must be a torinde 

Recording: (5562/ 9618) 
yeah well peopleis people do not have the priorities that they should you know what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die what did you do you know did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything you know i mean that tol me if you do not have time then you know you are just floating along trying to  pick it up space no 

Recording: (5563/ 9618)

Recording: (5564/ 9618) 
they yeah well the grandmother she says she is a christian but i do not see it  i mean a lot of people claime they are something and you know which i might not be a total christian because i do not do all the right things but i do believe in god i do believe i am going to go to heavenand i try not to you know send too much and i do pray to them and i you kno i just i do not go to church like i i used to go to church all when i was growing up and now i you know i feel like you do not have to go to church to believe in god and all that you know i talk to them i talk to my grandparents that ar ind heaven and stuff you know that is just what i was raised as and 

Recording: (5565/ 9618) 
nd i think it is bast year they had two murders over there and uh it was publicized in thecolumbus area but uh it is sho 

Recording: (5566/ 9618) 
sure 

Recording: (5567/ 9618) 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flagu or uh how much of a u how much do you have to have of the senate to pass a law you know it could be something real real technical or something that a three year old cauld ancwer because it is trying to hit you know all the areas that you have learned 

Recording: (5568/ 9618) 
umhum but most most of the vegetables are available truly the zukeni the uh you will find your your green peppers smaller your i got a um cucumber the other day and usually they are so big and i would tell you i wo t thnk it was that long 

Recording: (5569/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (5570/ 9618) 
i mean i obviously that is a long ways off um i i i guess i immagine i would be teaching in public schools so hopefully i could try to get toto where i was but but i i i do not know i mean maybe i do not know is that i i do not even know if iis dubling really better thn then columbus public or 

Recording: (5571/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5572/ 9618) 
yeah well he thinks he can do it 

Recording: (5573/ 9618) 
well the coaach he is pretty much got it alltogether you know he just needs to put everybody in their own separate category instead of having one person for one part of the team and then another person for another part of the team and 

Recording: (5574/ 9618) 
yes yeahthatsight you can not get a seat there 

Recording: (5575/ 9618) 
ou are right on the top 

Recording: (5576/ 9618) 
they  heard it all before and they some of them had known me for a few years but uh my wifes told after i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else  i do not believe tht yeahm

Recording: (5579/ 9618) 
may be kind of hard in ta whet she gets into a engineering teck program because she has not had all the math prerequisits because she just did not stay in school long enough 

Recording: (5580/ 9618) 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 

Recording: (5581/ 9618) 
i made a difference 

Recording: (5582/ 9618) 
no offense it is easier i a trying to call up 

Recording: (5583/ 9618)

Recording: (5584/ 9618) 
he talks about bighting even though he is never bit and um there is one particular boy right now when his family leaves he just has complete temperd tandroms and he is tried that out a few times too he is one you can leave and it does not base him he is very comfortable with other people but like the last month or so he is tried that a few times and i think he picked that up at day care seeing the other kids do that 

Recording: (5585/ 9618) 
well exactly i mean there are split seconds where you just want to shoot somebody un fortunately anybody says that i i mean i am i do not even like stepping on ants but there is those moments wher youare like 

Recording: (5586/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5587/ 9618) 
well i do not know af footis manrol couny or 

Recording: (5588/ 9618) 
oh yeah i think everybody should hafe nothing else you mised her boat by at that time 

Recording: (5589/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5590/ 9618) 
i i guess it is just over the course of the year everything balances out you know so 

Recording: (5591/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (5592/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (5593/ 9618) 
yeh 

Recording: (5594/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5595/ 9618) 
um both times i stayed around this little town uh it is like northwest of munic so it wwas southern um mostr 

Recording: (5596/ 9618) 
h 

Recording: (5597/ 9618) 
kind of dwindling 

Recording: (5598/ 9618) 
with the the children 

Recording: (5599/ 9618) 
yeah i went to collumbus public schools  uh thid not yeu knoh on im always over on the west side same area of town i always live there  lived there now um came up here t to osu uh  got my batchler is in uh english lit and then went to kasewestern reserve for masters thed ide cided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country which i got my library degree and the only job i could find was here in collumbus 

Recording: (5600/ 9618) 
but you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (5601/ 9618) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (5602/ 9618) 
yeah i  i you know i think too i polligise to my oldest daughter omost every day about fourt thing all i put her through whan we were trying to grow up te gather and i was twenty four when she was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable ber what they can do because if they are really verbal d my kids always have been really verable because i have talke to them from the moment they were born even what you know when they could not talke to me that was irrellovant i was talking to them the whole ti i wes wee  see i do not shut up so i would talke to them the whole time and so they would always be really verable and so would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we gout a hampstery nw i said well you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died it an i was so surprised thatshe had not given the be giveng give foodand water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not yeah they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furnatere and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone you know and so the th next year and a have she only had a maddress on the floor ind her room because but i mean nol that was basare now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things er i i would take more responsability rather tan the especting them to have it and secondly 

Recording: (5603/ 9618) 
anyway you know so just simply liveing 

Recording: (5604/ 9618) 
thi govertitis whoever wants to be 

Recording: (5605/ 9618) 
uhmuh 

Recording: (5606/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5607/ 9618) 
you can not isolate yourself from them it is like americans americans do not have a have a have a stronghold on it 

Recording: (5608/ 9618) 
well i will be honest i have a lot of home as sexual friends and being in the restaurant busiess and growing up in the restaurant business and that is how i really kind of met them when i was going to school i did not know any and i went to ou and honesy down there i did not know i did not know anybody was gay um i feel that a lot of people ore i will say most of them are all of them are born that way some of them do make a choice um but i feel that it should be talked about in school um for so long it was in the closet you know they did not talk about it and these kids you know had to hide it and i just think in today is world and there is so many people that are openly gay that it should be talked about more in school i do i think you know expc i just think some and women there is women that you know i had my jim teacher n brooka ven now that i looke at it i did not know then but she was gay i mean we did not i did not think that then i do not know why but she was very manly but she was very she was very good but she was you know just not feminine at all 

Recording: (5609/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (5610/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5611/ 9618) 
umhumum yeah it is always kind of scary i think you really need to get away from that to get yourself back 

Recording: (5612/ 9618) 
and therefore i am cool 

Recording: (5613/ 9618) 
i am trying to tink i therr it is a mire brand i know that is what we have it is like frutos instead of uh 

Recording: (5614/ 9618) 
well somehow or other yeah and if they if everybody would just begin to beel t that way and when they started to say something nasty i would think would i want them to say that to me 

Recording: (5615/ 9618) 
so the way the university here is run i can not agree with most of the stuff they do 

Recording: (5616/ 9618) 
changing the words des not change how someone feels about something 

Recording: (5617/ 9618) 
is that right the guys 

Recording: (5618/ 9618) 
i met him here um the year i moved back from florida and he had just moved back from dallas he had lived there for ten years 

Recording: (5619/ 9618) 
i read and 

Recording: (5620/ 9618) 
of dialog under one of their he cartoons and the cartoon told most of it 

Recording: (5621/ 9618) 
because i i did not own a telephone because i could not afford one and and also i thought if i had one they will call me well they would come you know if i did not get up at that time on my day off they would come knocking at the door and say we needed to come for a trip 

Recording: (5622/ 9618) 
hum 

Recording: (5623/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (5624/ 9618) 
i hope not some of these mongars that go as around and always predicts the worst things like everybody is saying tt the end that  you know when two thousand happens  do not go out and selebrate new year is te the year old s world is got to end wel how dols yoeu go to end you know and 

Recording: (5625/ 9618)

um then you submit ta porfolio in the fall for raeview and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department 

Recording: (5627/ 9618) 
so uh you know now that is just like they consider that like urban 

Recording: (5628/ 9618) 
just employers need to be employers just need to do that on their own and it is tough to be able to trust uh a business like that but it is a private business they need to be able to 

Recording: (5629/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5630/ 9618) 
lassy i think aod cemiris uh jus wath a few were ta what you re meaning to say uh maybe wrong but i think you are rede meaning tis say we must get back tew the family there must be two parentsand thet must recagnieis vhe are children and  do like you have just discussed uh do with them a and because aday weare just drifting and drifting and drifting we uh fifty percent of ht everyone who marries as divorce within a matter of about five years as hey understand the statistics today and uh un fortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feelyng that may be thist going toslowlyreverece or at least decrece not reverced probably uh once again we are talking about communications to und the communications can be ill and thy cang be great  uh as she is touched upon uhh but i feel that penjulum has to swing back from the non family we are headed to art are heave been headed toir and get back to a beve a basic family orientation a it it is av horrent when iy here that uh uh what was at seven ladies who are quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell there uh sperm u not there rs prerm whatever that is theysel uh for ten thousand dollhars appieced and be inplanted an nother so they ta and produced a quote beautiful child wol a beautiful child uh in if you are talking about just a physical features it it is meaningless it is what is in bodyed in that bady that is cann be beautiful instead of just a physical features that you look at and that to me is avorent such e such an ideah and that indeeds going ta take away from faily i cn in my way of thinking i canot imagine that i would uh have my wife producing somebody else is child of rer and i am going to have the same thank ouf that is ea fatherly love fatherly va yu fatherly instinct tored we with that child

Recording: (5745/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5746/ 9618) 
no not at all i think in the united states it is the driving force of our of our of our government and and even like because you without without a revenue based from the taxes of corporations t you could not have nearly the things that we have had and i think to would agree they would become fairly powerful but i do not think that is necessarily a bad thing uh when the unions were really strong i thought like we were i was reading about it i thought that was a good thing as well because that support of the support of the person but you could if you have good relations with your labor you do not necessarily need a union

Recording: (5843/ 9618) 
um well i have found that that i mean  everyone hasuh people from outsaide of the united statesthave sterio types about the united states and when they actually get to know someone those sterio types discipate um i mean i actually had a conversation very similar to this the other night with a couple of germans that i met at a coffye house um i mean the the stereo type that most americans have of germans are those are bavarians uh and not real bavarians but sterio typical bavarians uh beer drinking brotworth eating souer crout eating later hose wearing uh you know

Recording: (5846/ 9618) 
yeah and since it is not um sponsered officially by the um university they can do whatever they want and they do not have any uh possibility of um i am looking for a word here uh reprecutions 

Recording: (5847/ 9618) 
i have been some places where some men refused to sweat with women sometimes i felt kind of weird about it 

Recording: (5848/ 9618) 
i am a senior 

Recording: (5849/ 9618) 
oka 

Recording: (5850/ 9618)

Recording: (5851/ 9618) 
ye lie the uh they are like the people on crocadile dod a be where they just no they just like 

Recording: (5852/ 9618) 
i think for the most part people could handle it um obviously i think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole black rightes movements and things like that um i could see them having a problem with it but i meann more like more of the generations of today or whatever like basically any one under the age of about forty or fifty or so i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i do not think it would cause any huge problems or anything like that 

Recording: (5853/ 9618) 
it is right on their main street andh they have gorgeous really neat unicke things 

Recording: (5854/ 9618) 
because they have done away with uuh civil service step raisers which were wrong because i could have done a crumby job and got the same raise as doing a good job do not get me wrong but now it is that you got people you do not even respect in management a lot of times given to raise is and they have no idea what you are even doing 

Recording: (5855/ 9618) 
and there is like nothing in it and uh you know it is like go down the list that is what i do wathe he just thinks i automatically know i am a mind reader  that is what it is 

Recording: (5856/ 9618) 
w i am very proud of the way her and her sister are but i just think it is because mom was home and you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it does not have to be mom i mean uh you know mom can go work and dad can stay home and there is nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need mom or dad there every day when they cme home so they know when they come home when hey have had a really bad day and somethingis really bother hem they can talk to it as supposed as sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away and then when every body comes home it is like wel how how school okay 

Recording: (5857/ 9618) 
you know i mean so it is true um with different pets 

Recording: (5858/ 9618)

Recording: (5868/ 9618) 
uh i have always had an interest in german history and also in eastern european history and i mean it seemed to be a natural way that i could tie those two together for a thesis 

Recording: (5869/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (5870/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5871/ 9618)

Recording: (5874/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5875/ 9618) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (5876/ 9618) 
and i mean it is it is a easy to spell it is easy to say and you know you can shorten it to m or 

Recording: (5877/ 9618) 
um well actually i wanted to learn more about it i felt like like i had really have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it and maybe pick up like uh 

Recording: (5878/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5879/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (5880/ 9618) 
uh which which theth as far as the the 

Recording: (5881/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5882/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (5883/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (5884/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (5885/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5886/ 9618) 
i experienced it well uh um in some of our seramonies ui do nt uh this is confidential right no one else is going to see this because i do not want to um i do not want to have any this printed or anything you know ind u 

Recording: (5887/ 9618) 
eah  got into a situation where you reallyou were not there wis a no wind situation from the gitgo and uh uh i think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially it would have worked out okay but we were not so so it became a political war as everybody knows nothing about it 

Recording: (5888/ 9618) 
not in my lifetime he would have to probably be a closit gay 

Recording: (5889/ 9618) 
well that is just it that is part of it because like i see my parents would not come my mother used to try to come to things at school when i would be in different things and and i really did apprecet but my father would not he just we she would say well you know he just does not like that kind of thing i mean i would be ing a sonday spelling bend i would be ing the he he does not well do down down get youar bot down there and pretend like you like it and so you know with our fa and my husband is the same way his family with e  his father di when he was nine he was like the adult in this family he came from a buffalo new york working class he lefft he never looke back either and so it is kind of like you knare bot people always take say you know how we are such i i do not know we got the schools are always so grateful to us because we organized the state chest tournaments he started the baseball league for the bulding you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff and it is simply because we are so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids lives and to go to i mhecouch just basebal he a just you know um basketball we do not miss anything you know it does not matter what it is 

Recording: (5890/ 9618) 
a 

Recording: (5891/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (5892/ 9618) 
oh yeah it is 

Recording: (5893/ 9618) 
no because them kids still stop at my house 

Recording: (5894/ 9618) 
she does a really wonderful job because she has a flar for interior design and so that you know presents itself in her the way she sets everything up in the store so it is very attractive 

Recording: (5895/ 9618) 
yeah being three i did not really know anything hard attack ate too much of that good stuff 

Recording: (5896/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (5897/ 9618) 
uh basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 

Recording: (5898/ 9618) 
kids because a lot of times maybe they do not get that at home so they are really looking to choose the right thing to do and through school and through education that is their avenue to go there 

Recording: (5899/ 9618) 
so that like it is just the sheer numbers of it i think 

Recording: (5900/ 9618) 
first year finishing it up oh yeah oh it is definitely the the beginning i 

Recording: (5901/ 9618) 
and so um my parents retired here let us see they have been here i do not know four or five years maybe 

Recording: (5902/ 9618) 
umu 

Recording: (5903/ 9618)

tied up to a fence you know i think they deserve to die becausewt the prisons and the overcrowding tat is a whole another subject you know thatit is just ammazing to me thif so many people are in there that should be dead i feel because we are just paying for them to live in there 

Recording: (5911/ 9618) 
oh wow yeah 

Recording: (5912/ 9618) 
i do not i do not know if that is what purculates te it is very different in the public schools in the catholic scoos in the public school ou kohave all the problems of society inn the school you have the drugs you have the aps and t parents you hve the delinquency well in the catholic schol they just you do not have that for one thing and you know it is oriented around a church eve though we are not catholick it is still oriented that so there is a lot of values he purmiates everything well they do not do that in the public school because if you do that is some body is going to get tacked off it is the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid uh so i think that is missing and that is a problem with in the school the public schools uh so ite is just seems to be more distraction from the educational process you mean when you are in the catho lic school an you are in classroom they deal with the disciplind if they need tof cours part of the right way they deal with it is they take the real problems thit send them ove back to the public schools uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think it and it is harder for the teachers to teach because there is too much stuff in the way of dot they re in they really they are there to do 

Recording: (5913/ 9618) 
um i went to you see i applied to emmery harvord duke university of chicago and washington university so i got in to three of those and they they were neat places but

Recording: (5916/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (5917/ 9618) 
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scaring ofthe magic boxing we could continue to operating systems um the grol of leaning operating systems is real simple if you are playing with the computer and you screw something up the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over 

Recording: (5918/ 9618) 
i do not even know what their holidays are i i do not know 

Recording: (5919/ 9618) 
i think so but peaws like it is too close to my mouth reallybut 

Recording: (5920/ 9618)

Recording: (5921/ 9618) 
oh it is most of it is horribly liberal and they always find some way to misrepresent like uh kurwin

Recording: (5924/ 9618) 
yea 

Recording: (5925/ 9618) 
no i do not think it was because i grew up just basic not even really christian just really not no real religion and i hould been going to presbitarian church as i was about nineteen years old looking for something a church i just had a feeling that i wanted to have that in my life because i wod never had that before and so i was just looking around and i was open to anything i would listene to eastern religions and i have listened to the jobe as witnesses and and and then when i read in the book of morman it is just i it is a feeling of like like i felt like i had heard it before and it made sense to me and and so that is why i really felt at home with this and that is why i decided 

Recording: (5926/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (5927/ 9618) 
ell that is probably the roof rit ther so 

Recording: (5928/ 9618) 
with the ndbl acp 

Recording: (5929/ 9618)

o do you want to run over say what you are wantig to do 

Recording: (5932/ 9618)

Recording: (5940/ 9618) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (5941/ 9618) 
um i have not personally research that but i have seen um i would personally research it if i was precident um documentaries and what not and things on twenty twenty which i do not whole hardoally believe just because it is on tv and they say it is so but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it is on tv um that three strikes and you are out has really seemd to work in california because most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns are rapes or what not um are doing most of the crime so once they are locked up yeat cost more money to house them for life but they are saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets any more so they do not have to catch them thty do not have to process them eccetera um so i would really like to see that and plus i think once that really is in wrt the works and really working and weare really do what we are going to say we are doing and staid of like little parents no iyou do not do that no anyo do not do that you know what i mean because i think that is part of our problem too

by 

Recording: (5995/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (5996/ 9618) 
yeah yeah umhum 

Recording: (5997/ 9618) 
ou know you know wat i mean 

Recording: (5998/ 9618) 
the bad places the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that thatis had a lot to do with changing oure younger jeneration and the way they think the way they act what their morals are and i think that iswhy they are having more shootings in schools and uh i the programs are terrible i think that they need to realy re do them there is too much profanity there is too much sex there is too much to do what i want i got to do my own thing that is what when to i want to do my own thing started he says with the women is feminius movement and it probably did and it probably did have something to deal with it uh because after all so mudy speaking up and they want to do things my well  wel well bing crosbe who was it  know um 

Recording: (5999/ 9618) 
there is the ones that will get out there with their picket signes an raise hell okay 

Recording: (6000/ 9618) 
u 

Recording: (6001/ 9618) 
yeah exactly and it is just uh it is just ridiculous but so many people do not seem to think that way and i do think yeah access it would help if access were restricted or at least if they were more careful about it i mean it seems like even the laws that there are in place now are not necessarily followed and you know that kind of thing 

Recording: (6002/ 9618) 
because they are so stylish 

Recording: (6003/ 9618) 
it is difficult you feel alone a lot of the time u and i am not as liberal as i used to be uh s i thinks um with age thi gets tempered ta lit tle bit but still tend to be a little morele liberal and t s uh you know it does not matter who i vote for they are going to lose uh and i just stay out a lot of discussions it was interest  our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion anything we wanted to uh but you know she would stop if we got te point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was long after i left home actually before i realized that not everybody is tt way not everybody wants to hear your views uh so i particularly around my inlaws the are very conservative of southern ohio uh raised during the depression uh in a depressed area so i i learned my motherinlaw took any time you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her so i just learned  not to say anything yeah uh my fatherinlaw was not that way but my motherinlaw was 

Recording: (6004/ 9618) 
very different uh ere just been a lot of innovations and 

Recording: (6005/ 9618) 
um i mean fact of the matter is if being gay is a genetic disorder then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be u normal i guess or whatever you want to say 

Recording: (6006/ 9618) 
isee 

Recording: (6007/ 9618) 
um well because my cousins and uh they all have uh they are very you know well educatedd they are more affluent and i think that uh maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 

Recording: (6008/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6009/ 9618) 
he found out he could just move yeah so you know he always got away from that 

Recording: (6010/ 9618) 
oh what you have to nowdays you know i do not understaynd the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just does not happen now now you know if your wife did not work you could expect these things but she is doing forty hours a week to so it is it is work an it is a full time job they start she the seven year old just  here it isat the end of the year second grade she brings home this project going to have to have a book greeport yous three books  frac franct hou know she is never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long you know getting this information out of her you know she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on itis goingto have to staynd up ind front of the class and make a box with a display in it and how jut like this i second grade this seems more like you know six  there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids you kno i can not believe in second grade we were already writing curseve already that is all she rites in now i mean i seems like they were teaching it then maybe you might be learning some of yeah she is infractions and she is doing fractions she is doing percentages already in second grade and i thought we were one plus one two b you know and say ra itis just seems like they are three years ahead so 

Recording: (6011/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6012/ 9618) 
later next afterward 

Recording: (6013/ 9618) 
so i do not know just like e 

Recording: (6014/ 9618) 
umhum and then they end up okay anyway  that is good 

Recording: (6015/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6016/ 9618) 
well yeah we got broke into uh think twice and stuff got stollen my truck is been broken into my mom is car is been broken into nd th gas sifened pretty much everybody around there is been uh criminalized one way or another 

Recording: (6017/ 9618) 
u know so if it is kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then i do not need it 

Recording: (6018/ 9618) 
wol 

Recording: (6019/ 9618) 
ou know how far theye held responsible i do not know you would have to go on a case by case basis 

Recording: (6020/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6021/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6022/ 9618) 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida uh he was quite a bit younger and i was and i knew he wanted children and i never wanted children unfortunately i i love animals and things but i just never decided i never wanted children and i knew he eventually would so uh i was engaged to him but i decided to 

Recording: (6023/ 9618) 
i am getting i am getting rfa 

Recording: (6024/ 9618) 
umum hmum 

Recording: (6025/ 9618) 
to the most part yeah i mean obviously like they said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like with research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condem it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6026/ 9618) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger morgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (6027/ 9618) 
i uh i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but uuh but t isni i i do not like it as well as clumbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university ayeah 

Recording: (6028/ 9618) 
just you know 

Recording: (6029/ 9618) 
but we really ever really have not talked about that but my exwife is got family here so uh you know she comes in about two or three weeks at least ouof summer 

Recording: (6030/ 9618) 
heard about that but the same principale applies but i am taught about just eveery day things uh that uh people wou do not eve you want to talk of a toup children primarily uh there is no penalty anymore uh parents are scared to death uh to pick uh one up and spank them uhm with their baire hands or or to make them stand in a corner because they considered  u a gog back to the word herrasmic child abuse and herrassedmet of consequence uh and a ah an penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at janians and jany you should not do that 

Recording: (6031/ 9618) 
oh yeah umhum 

Recording: (6032/ 9618) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really good to get a good uh feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work becubecause there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual thing and young people theyre you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and theni you know i think it is kind of 

Recording: (6033/ 9618)

yeahno 

Recording: (6043/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6044/ 9618) 
that um incompuses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is caoss even though it seems like it is an accident uh there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move at and things happen and death is part of life physical det and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not diye you do not physically maybe you know there is no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that it wi no 

Recording: (6045/ 9618)

Recording: (6055/ 9618) 
i i think i think it is i think it is fair i think it should be that domestic partners should be should be covered i think there should probably be some uh 

Recording: (6056/ 9618) 
yeah we had a my mom has a friend that does alter sounds 

Recording: (6057/ 9618) 
that i think that we would be ready 

Recording: (6058/ 9618) 
you know he hadad 

Recording: (6059/ 9618) 
and it is 

Recording: (6060/ 9618) 
you know when he is up at night i i have to do it it is my responsibility now and i mean people think that you know oh you get a lot of help no  they have their lives out of mine 

Recording: (6061/ 9618) 
did not have it done through seramoney nothing like that and heven the man that he followed for a while was sitting in a rust home over in south dacota now because he is old he was on his way out and he was a roaade man gave his life you know for eighty nine tribes to help them find and refind their connection with their spirituality that they ould lost um because of the missionaries bringing christianity i mean um 

Recording: (6062/ 9618) 
yeah my my best friend lives in un outside cambera and she has a lot of medical problems but huh 

Recording: (6063/ 9618) 
uh i was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up with as i was but there were a lot of them that were 

Recording: (6064/ 9618) 
namesi uh actually read a story and some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she did not know what she had twins and she did not know what to name them and she would run out of names that she liked so they brought her um lunch in to her and the nurse jokingly sad or the eight or something we just picked a couple f names off the menue so she named them lamanjelo and orranjelo lemonjello orange jellow she picked lemon jello orange jellow and turned them into lamanjelo and orranjelo denice and denephe 

Recording: (6065/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6066/ 9618) 
you know technically there is incenity and there is an insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is an insaine and uh just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them uh mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and um  uhd so ihave got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh ah reincarnation e law costs an effect and if a person murder somebody they need they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their uh their guilt and what theyhave done and and a lot of them do not they say that harden criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (6067/ 9618) 
to get them thinking about itand then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (6068/ 9618) 
do not say oh well your son is going to be gay he is two right now let us you know change this so it soit does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (6069/ 9618) 
its 

Recording: (6070/ 9618) 
you can not you can not be matted somebody for choosing a live style you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (6071/ 9618) 
right  same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outside the hose they get home they are aggravated they are upset somebody le they had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situationis got that way but i do belive that the older people including are government people and everybody at is the the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (6072/ 9618) 
as he was speaking and and as he started to speak i realized to another thing that i really feel has a tremendous inpression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as tha people 

Recording: (6073/ 9618) 
oh uhhuh 

Recording: (6074/ 9618) 
now that was up the age ateanto are they are about to i think that the you sait to get back to the very beginning of the birth an up tokinneg gareent or forth wo i that is that is the family but u i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh  what i call the older values of but but b good values i do not  in whether ther older new but good valuese and i think we really need to have that astabbege within our educational system uh starting in the elementaryan right on up two college i think there ought to be a number of colleg uh courses uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students cin go back and uh u assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values uh i could even so go so faur as to say iny chemistry or bottiny ore sychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but i think there are elements that tay can have within each one of those talking about family value family value uh and that will help thenpermiate the entiore society and but it is got to start back here in at first and i think 

Recording: (6075/ 9618) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service a guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a buraucracy 

Recording: (6076/ 9618) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (6077/ 9618) 
that that is what is making the these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (6078/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6079/ 9618) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (6080/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6081/ 9618) 
in english 

Recording: (6082/ 9618) 
yeah so i i have experience in that and i i am thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing to what is going on inside your head and your body is not that peaceful yeah 

Recording: (6083/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6084/ 9618) 
for example so you should name her tammera 

Recording: (6085/ 9618)

Recording: (6093/ 9618)

Recording: (6099/ 9618) 
basically because thef plans which the utilities had for our locations they could not provide to us because of the uh the vesteur riling so we had to go out and uh  do our own surveys become seducated through uh courses uh through att and through perdu university it wasa i think o you had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major intell communication group but uh the projects basically we were going from a um putting a gether a network itself and we had  yyou think of a party line system or the ust called dasychaine in he industry uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to a data network and uh we got down to the point where we went to a spoake network where everyone had a dedicated pipe 

Recording: (6100/ 9618) 
well been shey i woasd not much i my being here and my daughter being neare i did not really have the uh time with her that i wished i would have had you know but uh uh her mother  you know ded there all right ind everything but i wished i would have been more involved in her growing uh and i think two people families are generallyvebetter you know for not necessarily living be you know uh being married ind everything but 

Recording: (6101/ 9618) 
shansin yeah uhhuh iam ih we do not have enough saxofphones sure we could use yoa 

Recording: (6102/ 9618) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (6103/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6104/ 9618) 
yeah o was not anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so 

Recording: (6105/ 9618) 
yeah like a lot of people like i do not i do not know why a lot of people go but like with aa lot of people i know it is like go to hear really good music and like it is amazing like what happens you know like people together and like people dancing together you look out and everybody is dancing you know like the music is really good and everybody is really into it and working 

Recording: (6106/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6107/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6108/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6109/ 9618) 
most people i associate with and this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (6110/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6111/ 9618) 
and but enu know that dherin goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean if obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs ind the basement to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his nervana or whatever you know and uh and his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (6112/ 9618) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basically the same penalties that you would run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids have the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6113/ 9618) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (6114/ 9618) 
so he did not 

Recording: (6115/ 9618) 
yeah so yeah and a lot of people turn eighteen when they are in high school so i am sure they can go get one there 

Recording: (6116/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (6117/ 9618) 
yes i do uh bet i try to visit at least uh at least two every two years we either we go to new york or we meet halfway couple years ago we met at pinstate and uh so you know the older ones are all dying off though so 

Recording: (6118/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6119/ 9618) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (6120/ 9618) 
oh it is just so evey the environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open ore more receptive to relationships and uh you know i think it is a much frendlier place and thend i i just think the vibrations are higher up there you just do not have proverty well if anybody is in proverty in oregan it is because they have chosen to live a simple life it is not ah you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregan is not that great but you know they say in ugeene that even the dish shwortiers have pchddve well the the uh the level of the years of education per capitis probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (6121/ 9618) 
not there othere important roles where would those nuns be where would your mother possiably bena she went to cathilic school i take it where would she have been is e went for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked lot less than your mother iis even getting compencated for e and they had a very important role for your development even though your generation is removed 

Recording: (6122/ 9618) 
yeah yeah  and the funny thing about that is if i heard one of those songs once i might not be that turned off by it  but if you aregoing nto play it at me you know six times ind three hours 

Recording: (6123/ 9618) 
i heard something the other day that really really upset me i was at um this convention downtown at the convention center and uh one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops as a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear youare writing to a person who is in the eighth grade 

Recording: (6124/ 9618) 
that is great 

Recording: (6125/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6126/ 9618) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the passt month or til so i am i am working for research firm just for the convenience of the hours i i one i got back intof a nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because it would be at least an eight hour shift and uh i do not think that we are ready for that yet he is a teacher umhum he works at high school yoaw he teaches ninth and tenth graders no  i do not think that at all i would be deceving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about them i am just like oh mie ioash i can not believe all  thef the the things that these kids are experiencing i did not know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about that when i was that age and it is kind of scary 

Recording: (6127/ 9618) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot an animal t be shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they ui know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money and did not have any food theyj would not killtd some animals and gave itto hemn i do not have a problem with that uh uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gun control he he believes whatever charleton heston tells him 

Recording: (6128/ 9618) 
i think my grandpal goes to church 

Recording: (6129/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6130/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6131/ 9618) 
and he travels all over the state of ohio 

Recording: (6132/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (6133/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6134/ 9618) 
and unfortunately uh they did not really prove anything except for that they that death is final 

Recording: (6135/ 9618) 
oh yeh 

Recording: (6136/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6137/ 9618) 
you you what wou you be doing eight children and 

Recording: (6138/ 9618) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (6139/ 9618) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person isa pretty decent person i mean i do not think ha there is anything violent or there are just anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and makes a big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that is sort of what people pick up ther perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school is like volunteering at like the local senior citizenis home or something like that 

Recording: (6140/ 9618) 
but i mean like if test schors are identical and they have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (6141/ 9618) 
because i do not know it just was like if i get pregnant i get pregnant that you do not know of what you really have to go through of having a baby you know because i guess i really did not care if a if i got pregnant i got pregnant it did not it did not really you know register my mind that this wil you know not ruined but it was it will change your whole life 

Recording: (6142/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6143/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6144/ 9618) 
yeah and it just did not work 

Recording: (6145/ 9618) 
it is in northern ohio it is near iliria which is west of cleveland 

Recording: (6146/ 9618) 
sright with him 

Recording: (6147/ 9618)

Recording: (6149/ 9618) 
girls i have never seen them take a guy out of a bar 

Recording: (6150/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6151/ 9618) 
um they more or less buy a dog for a token 

Recording: (6152/ 9618) 
well i guess i would have to say i do not necessarily like middle school but see when you get a special isertificut you are certified kindergarten through twelfeth so i did several years in the high school when i was first out of college i did high school first then i went to elementary whell my kids ware in elementary so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know and then six years ago i went to the middle school and i have decided that i am too old to keep up with these kids not only are they learning disability and add but they are middle schoolersand they have like hornmons running ramput all over the outside of their bodies you can not tell which is the hornmons and which is the add and which is the learning disability but like i said i  only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through that 

Recording: (6153/ 9618) 
i think it is better probably if they do not i meanyo say anything about it you know and most ofhem people will you know like when you get to i lived in to berrics a lot of time but i mean you know a lot of people you know thy get their own places off bace you know and who cares whith that i mean i do not care yo knw like i say i  have gay friends that you know i do not care what they do i mean ii they are old enough to do whatever hec they want to do you know 

Recording: (6154/ 9618) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6155/ 9618) 
short north is in the short north but um it is so much fun it is absolutely so much fun because it is really weird um you normally do not get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club but when you got to access you do not get hit on by girls you get hit on by guys i dance with glostics and i have had i had like seven guys come up to ou hem in one night and they are just like can can you like can you do that for me 

Recording: (6156/ 9618)

Recording: (6158/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6159/ 9618) 
yeah he wants to teach he is he likes football and he wants the coach football but you have to teach to do that so 

Recording: (6160/ 9618) 
we hear um and now that is the most newsworthy story out there so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it the media 

Recording: (6161/ 9618) 
um it is an ego trip that is all it is basically it is like look i can do this 

Recording: (6162/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6163/ 9618) 
oh my gosh it was  it was it was just unbelievable he got really sick after that rush week yeah really sick so they want in to movi in the fraternity house he can not really afford it but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he is like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so i am thinking they might help him out a little bit they want him in the house real bad 

Recording: (6164/ 9618) 
basically uh it is just the talk and stuff it is not uh like you know what i mean uh i am black i am better or i am white i am better it is it is none of that 

Recording: (6165/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (6166/ 9618) 
yeahi is gone downhill a lot 

Recording: (6167/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6168/ 9618) 
and i is if you know any teenagers the more strict you make it the more they rebell 

Recording: (6169/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6170/ 9618) 
i you know from my perspective which is sceed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be afferican american um if i were affrican american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touoch with it with that situation 

Recording: (6171/ 9618) 
so if you if you you you could not bring ny any like pets but iwild say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the stay so you have to leave all those 

Recording: (6172/ 9618) 
well we we went in at naples 

Recording: (6173/ 9618) 
nope humum 

Recording: (6174/ 9618) 
oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about whas the and when he wis fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finished school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money and i mean we do not need to have a tun but we just should be at least a little out of det  yeah something 

Recording: (6175/ 9618) 
it is just 

Recording: (6176/ 9618) 
o 

Recording: (6177/ 9618) 
you know 

Recording: (6178/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (6179/ 9618) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress progression that needs to be made uh i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who is ah felow history major and her nd actually her brother is a felow fellow history major two and a friend of min i do not know them all that well bat uh parently her family i ean she is she is double major history ind chemistry she plans to go to medschool her parents her family supports here in this but they have made it painfully clear that when at she should not plan on having a career because it she is going to have to raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my belief and and and the fact that it is like the mailes telling the daughter like this is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think anialindividual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that is sort of going i am hoping at is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scary or back in like ninety four an inety five but uh i think  we have reached a point where becausis not all of the advancees have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (6180/ 9618) 
but when he did have something to do with them it was kind of strange they would go out and whissle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (6181/ 9618) 
ye the big things 

Recording: (6182/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6183/ 9618) 
yeah pretty much 

Recording: (6184/ 9618) 
they 

Recording: (6185/ 9618) 
ell the main thing is they never leave they do not they go lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest gpa of any college 

Recording: (6186/ 9618) 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a milliaonar with all the lawsuits of different yeah experience with um sexual harassment 

Recording: (6187/ 9618) 
oh well in oregon well i was down in california for three months and u and uh i went to the produce stand and i took my umbrella and of course it does not rain too much cafornia and i said oh i am from oregon and i always think it is going to rain and he says well i am from washington and i know it is gong to ain

Recording: (6194/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6195/ 9618) 
yeah the media exposure

Recording: (6204/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (6205/ 9618)

Recording: (6206/ 9618) 
wy is that 

Recording: (6207/ 9618)

Recording: (6213/ 9618) 
ums magnified a ad or yeah they have that choice they can say well listen you do not understand an bove av onnw i have tried that but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself and terms of listen uh i hear what you are saying but i am trying to show you that uh and tell you how i work best so as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedome and give me gols of what you want accomplishe and give me the freedom to accomplish in the way that i can do it uh not by quoteas and dead lines and crap like tha um i can shol you what to do and that is that is the struggle on tham right now trind to find employment where people will companes am slack you know and i wanted to do some driving but you know uh because at least out on the road you know im put up with ind ons crap but along drive in long distances is not good for me focusing concentrating uh and i i have had you know several accidents several tickets u so i mean i have even had uh you know two other head injuries 

Recording: (6214/ 9618)

Recording: (6221/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6222/ 9618)

i at this point i blame it on the administration um and the citizens of collumbus have not i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now they defeated a levey you should never defeat a school levy 

Recording: (6256/ 9618) 
that makes it hard like if you got likeif like you and you got a family you know you know you take  you want to you wanttd  like spend a night on in a town with you you know with your family man that  that kind of lik blows your whole budget for the year 

Recording: (6257/ 9618) 
yeah they will just take one scripture and they will expand it um and ad they will just run with that one scripture and then there are also churches that will just dileats they will andh in m in their minds they will dileat certain sections of the scripture that they do not like first corinthians chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here in collumbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and and um the extremely tabo um religious topic among a lot of churches is the gift of tongs whether it is dead whether it is not whether it is inspired whether it is not inspired yeadiaa blabla well i had not even heard about it until i got to collumbus becauset and and i know the bible pretty well and i had not even heard about it until i got to collumbus and i get to collumbus and i am like okay this is pretty cool an went home and i am talking to some people in my parents church and they are like oh yeah um we just do not really talk about that very often and and i am just

Recording: (6264/ 9618) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (6265/ 9618) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids lot of kids are on medication to day that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parent or some doctor that like for example wn we have refer kids and worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not jus give this kt a pill if he does not have eiht out of the twelve symptems or whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this  those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these docktors also asske for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any appreciable difference and two or three weeks tand you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in and obzerve the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids does not face them they might as well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunc your groawth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headakes from dexadrine and ad or all so i say you know if it works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because there may be just not able to pay attention a little bit but then not really add and thet parents are taking them in and go and jorno these not getting strewe days put him on something  so i guess 

Recording: (6266/ 9618) 
hh 

Recording: (6267/ 9618) 
i like it um i have lived i have only lived in the northern end i have lived in doublin and old worthington and naw heard which is kind of around the side u but i like it because it has it is own little well especially worthington it is own little city within the city

Recording: (6270/ 9618) 
ell he uses it when he has like car problems or something he tends to like to drive his own car you know they have to park so far away 

Recording: (6271/ 9618) 
it is not going to work 

Recording: (6272/ 9618) 
yeah probably because we have some public systems most of them are for the librarians but there is some for public too 

Recording: (6273/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6274/ 9618) 
i think when you have two or more pets you have to make a little bit more effort 

Recording: (6275/ 9618) 
yeah it was pretty much upper a middle class 

Recording: (6276/ 9618) 
i wonder if that is also of a socialized medicine there it is socialized is not it 

Recording: (6277/ 9618) 
which was uh a going thing 

Recording: (6278/ 9618) 
um i have a class at um high school that it is called grads and it is like um you know all the kids in there are people that have kids 

Recording: (6279/ 9618) 
i have got nothing against christianity but i got something against the way it was brought here 

Recording: (6280/ 9618) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6281/ 9618) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrong that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and en making that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (6282/ 9618) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i would think 

Recording: (6283/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6284/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6285/ 9618) 
you know what um actually i do not believe they have anything books so far a lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather than having people come in to their homes and things i have usually i have worked for different hotels where i have always worked on new year is eve and my husband this year is like you know but we do not even have any plans we were goingta maybe do something with some friends and they are going to california so i am not sure even exactly what i am going to do but um right now there is not an event scheduled 

Recording: (6286/ 9618) 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh heh i i  went to school with blacks so i mean that was not that big athing except forove the influx of the you know i didmne realize how many were being drafted or being in listing to the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the in the country you know 

Recording: (6287/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6288/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6289/ 9618) 
and i mean yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact orf the matter is it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (6290/ 9618) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (6291/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6292/ 9618) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were going to buy a house thing clentan ville to hold them and rent them my problhem is i do not have any money so i that down payment i has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a coupleof condo tover on bethel rod for my kids to live in so th my oldest girl when she wasgoing arady to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i ill be your landlady and then t wd it will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was going to move out when she graduate from high school and changed your mind so i  just rented that one but it the bottom line is i i just got a second morgage and i have a guy that i worked with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would you wouldbe fined you would be running you would not buy anything that you did not think you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (6293/ 9618) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (6294/ 9618) 
yeah and and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they have got their input and i think that it is just a mixture of everything 

Recording: (6295/ 9618) 
and do not insult us anymore or we will go to trial um so my attorney jumped ut back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars i could not take sitting there these guys going back and forth of what they felt it was worth even the arbitrateor was at ashal um but uh that is the way that system works 

Recording: (6296/ 9618) 
okay uh my name is i uh am an undergrd doble major in german in history currently working in a senior oner is thesis in history i will be graduating next quarter after a grand total of six years as an undergrad un impressive uh somewhat disturbing six years aas an undergrad uh i live in german villege uh i like it here grew up here like it here uh i think of it as a big city having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns whichi have also been too of course u 

Recording: (6297/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6298/ 9618) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i am thinking i may get into that 

Recording: (6299/ 9618) 
umhum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh r  seems like there is a lot more to do in collumbus obviously but 

Recording: (6300/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (6301/ 9618) 
disy 

Recording: (6302/ 9618) 
there is just too much diversity 

Recording: (6303/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (6304/ 9618) 
well i lived on twelfe maybe about four or five years ago probably longer but at was just for a summer thing you know after i saw the couches being burned i saidno 

Recording: (6305/ 9618) 
that was a lot of old thinking 

Recording: (6306/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6307/ 9618) 
i have seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder it is like the same thing over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 

Recording: (6308/ 9618) 
thirty nine 

Recording: (6309/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6310/ 9618) 
um the first year they made it in state only um second the second clas that they aregoingnto be starting they have some people from michigan i think 

Recording: (6311/ 9618) 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but it took him a while to catch on to things 

Recording: (6312/ 9618) 
i remember it being it is a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they were not together because they al both gave me a lot of attention but um about i think i was maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 

Recording: (6313/ 9618) 
like on noh it is like it is it is really serious and it is really not serious like it is it is everything i guess 

Recording: (6314/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6315/ 9618) 
um so i think that part definitely helps where aso most of my other friends you know they are kind of lost they do not know exactly what they are doing um where like i said i have already done all the stuff that we are doing now and know how to go about it and 

Recording: (6316/ 9618) 
well that is good that is good 

Recording: (6317/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (6318/ 9618) 
yeah i have a brother and two sisters 

Recording: (6319/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6320/ 9618) 
youe 

Recording: (6321/ 9618) 
a little bit faster uh but men and then when i get out off service i get twenty two you know it wis kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff that did not have to go and uh so i had had a lot of uh good times as far as that goes and you know cleaniness and exto galiness and all that stuff you know i mean a lot of people do not ther is just a lot of lax stuff goes on today in my opinion but 

Recording: (6322/ 9618) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just come in from lmyk christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice if they would teach you how to be confident yourself and i do not mean like self esteeme but you know like we said if if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you know what iy mean kind of 

Recording: (6323/ 9618) 
and uh i said our our engineers they are not engineers persay but they are teckis that are really into this they they enjoy their work and it is for it is in the four front of ohio government along with the technology there has to elst be the paper work now i do not realize we have a paperless environment quote unquote 

Recording: (6324/ 9618) 
um i was in more north florida ta around talahassy so that is  that is a little different i mean that is that is not that is more southern georgia basically uh um i not know i mean yeah  it is not so touristy and theythe a thing where you could not have any buildings bigger than the state capital because they did not want it to be like orlando or mimi like mimi especially so tht as relly interesting it was  it different type of town like not not i so many palm trees more big oak trees and stuff like that yeah it is real it is more not all of us scentralized downtown it is more of a like spreading out 

Recording: (6325/ 9618) 
even my mother who is she said if nicxon were running to day she would vote for him she is that much of a conservative uh agrees with what is happened but most people will say the same thing there should have ben another way to get him out of there but at this point i do not think there really was uh a few months ago yeah but 

Recording: (6326/ 9618) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and told me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get a extra income to come in and um his dad madei actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than that becausethe man every time we go over there he is up on the computer doing something so and i am on their you know just i look up baby stuff get cupons and stuff um you know like reading about things that happen to people like they are kids spitning up in their face or something 

Recording: (6327/ 9618) 
would not you like him to see that you know like 

Recording: (6328/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6329/ 9618) 
i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (6330/ 9618) 
it is just ot of your control and i mean like yiu said i mean that is sort of kidis for you i mean they just obviously they are gon no be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (6331/ 9618) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well it is my choice oh god my husband is a lot better ar these type of questions because he was methdist and he chose to drink authlike when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the catholic relidion and the more i was exposed to his it is like boy these really are similar but yours is a lot looser than mine and you know i was you k um just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sus and drugs and being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (6332/ 9618) 
mhumoh okay 

Recording: (6333/ 9618) 
you can not see it in aday 

Recording: (6334/ 9618)

Recording: (6335/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6336/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6337/ 9618) 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it is not just a hostae it would be anywhere you go you know it is just like i said you get excuse me you get ass holes in 

Recording: (6338/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (6339/ 9618) 
yeah yeah 

Recording: (6340/ 9618) 
i do not know about that yeah he has not showne that period yet i do not know if he is supposed to be showing it now or not because um i mean when he goes to his anamy is you knowju by mo you know  look up okay by m that is ad 

Recording: (6341/ 9618) 
she is going al right as far as i know she is going to saint louis university and  do not ask me why but 

Recording: (6342/ 9618) 
but um um one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look fo mally 

Recording: (6343/ 9618) 
no 

Recording: (6344/ 9618) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run  it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a traide or a skill or something that will get them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of probabing a banker selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for for you growing up and going into a life style i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens then somebody wrobbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean  that is a bradspectrum and i know it is not all that cut and drd um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (6345/ 9618) 
riht 

Recording: (6346/ 9618) 
uh well iil take for one thing when i was overcees if we wanted to do sometin we wouldwait until the sirgan went in the shead and wewould just put a padlock on the door so he could not get out

Recording: (6348/ 9618) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (6349/ 9618) 
umhum yeah yeah it is been glammorized and they do not they do not value human life either i do not think because there is so much violence you know you can not watch tv and not see in somebody gets shot or something and it is just like it is not really rel because it is you know you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else you know like see it was not real and i do not think they i think i do not know 

Recording: (6350/ 9618) 
yeah and it it has the least amount of people which is kind of neat as far as trurism so 

Recording: (6351/ 9618)

Recording: (6356/ 9618) 
no not really i mean i would have prefered it of course and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did but no i am i am very happy and content with her decisionyeah very much so a as a matter of fact ironically juli the talso she and her husband both baptists they have both their children and a catholic prep school and yeah kintdergarten and preschool and it is uh yes it i it is a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves from the children is uh attention to the the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 

Recording: (6357/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6358/ 9618) 
ohwow

Recording: (6374/ 9618) 
fgures

i was born in new york 

Recording: (6380/ 9618) 
and i am saying i could take that rout but it it would cost me a lottom money that i do not have to get the legal defense and it would be just best for me to take the responsibility like i have and i sold the car that i had to my sister uh i am going to pay back the appartment complex that i signed te lease for u but i am going to make them come after me yyou know you know uh i already went to court once and and uh  well even even with the evidence being in my favor i mean it was onely at this place three months i did not do any damage to it um and the walls did not need paint it i was not there long enough to make them dirty uh but um their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out and my mother and i clean that thing spot li stop bottom bathrooms om wash the floors and mopp the floors and everything and uh their own person came through and said it rated  the paintt an ay which meant according to their system ay ment no 

Recording: (6381/ 9618) 
those are the formative years of a child 

Recording: (6382/ 9618) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changiing in the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh we were w ware not a consideration ind the in oh i say probably my first thirty may be forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not pinancial it was influence from the person who could get up phere and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the were topinion but a know that is not right it he sway them with a possition that he had developed now that is not necessarily his oppinion so am ptrying to make a point there  but he would sway them based uppon the influences that he had had from u uh various people with in his community or whether whether you are talking about a township pror counties state whatever it may be and yes uh uh then  slowly then i think the finances came in to play and finances have come to uh horrible horrible situation as of today and i will leave out this the the last two years it ha obecaourse it is because it is rather specific right now but going back to two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i amsinion even on local levels i know wewithin the imediat community there are people out theire uh  come on we will go  to dinner we will goll to this andd we will do this and do this justu just barely barila braking uh the barior but not breaking the law uh so yes very definitely progressively has changed 

Recording: (6383/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6384/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6385/ 9618) 
i i do not think anyone really affected anyone too too much as far as that goes 

Recording: (6386/ 9618) 
in a strange city i know oh my god 

Recording: (6387/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6388/ 9618)

Recording: (6391/ 9618) 
yeah they are okay they are parents they are in their seventies now i i take what i need and leave the rest because they have got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine so 

Recording: (6392/ 9618) 
you know they do not understand the concept so they do not know any different of you know why did not we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but yeah but i still think you know they benefit it a lot from it now

family experiences 

Recording: (6396/ 9618) 
yeah i mean i want to see how the season ends out it is just a lot of the ones this season to me i have just been disappointing the  i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of level off i meath the simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny and then they had some writing changes i think and this this season it is just it is been completely outrageous story lignes and like the jokes are not as integrated into the story 

Recording: (6397/ 9618)

not specifically no uh sometimes um little groups uf sometimes wei if there is a college in a community when i was running a school leviy campaign um we would try to get them either registered and and active in a campaign um but it was very difficult is sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting youknw there are certain little blocks of people uh and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens i mean they they went to the poles and droves you did not have to you know the the the hope there was that they would not go to vote  on the school levy uh but actually trying to get college kids involved i have not really specifically done that as a whole campain in and of itself it might be a little pocket of a campaign but nothing big 

Recording: (6435/ 9618) 
no no they did not um they did not pay for grading or preparing your classes or or researching anything  so right but but still even though it was real a very much underpaid job bi i liked it when i did it um i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to develop my own corriculum for it  right they had a when they told me i i they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book that was about the sthick and it was only about painting

Recording: (6460/ 9618) 
if if we ran scor sports i mean the game ofsports not the ad ministn t ad ministration of sports iis just as unethical as tha business world it is unethical and that is one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we have emphasized sports along with a theater as being oh the way to go and tha the bor the poorest bench marks you could have in terms of financial uh uh appreciation sure you theh thing is you market demands the uh dollar that type of thing well yeahoue going to do it but the thing is it gets almost beg like a law suit case we are crazy and sing people again gets back to ethics do you think do you think i am worth thirty million dollars let me ask you let let me ask you question why in thehell are you comeing  asking for thirty million dollars do not you think you are uncooth

Recording: (6481/ 9618) 
yeah shouldhave been in class 

Recording: (6482/ 9618) 
just i think it is ah to reflect the the um beliefs that we are trying to carry and and because i think if someone showed up and looking like i mean you are not saying that it is terrible ta but if they had like a knose ring and all the stuff then if somebody might not believe that they have anything credible to say and a lot of times if you are dressed more respectfully that to you know i mean most the people will accept you if you are dressed and ad dresse where as i mean even in a person in a nose rangel will respect you but but then you are in a you are at a disadvantage if you do not  dress in a certain way 

Recording: (6483/ 9618)

Recording: (6487/ 9618) 
they  they definitely struggle they they do i  i think to be that high up obviously you are goingto come in contact with powerfll people rich people and things like that but i think at least even if the democrats do have that same thing they seem to keep more in mind the i do not i do not think they represent working class you know guy either but at least more so than the republicans so like i said best out of a bad bunch i would probably 

Recording: (6488/ 9618)

uh outer en is over i do not even know  la

okay 

Recording: (6514/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6515/ 9618) 
uh okayokay it is part of growing up yai n i have been there ad done that to but still you got to you have to uh know there is  respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it you got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they solve the interaction with the elderly people the school you went to there is a lot of public envolvement public service required the teachers i often ask the teachers i have gone to sporting events and their teachers are their ticket takers uh moniteryn the crowd where the kids ask in i said do you gouys gevet go home no wnowe yeah is it but they are always there they are not they are just teaching a class hey are not theire preparing the class they are theire after the class they are tere for the student and they make a student feel part of the family that itis a continuation of my philosofhy at home we interact the school  is great you have people that are on the clock what trying to quit they are gone hthose people do not know the meaning of life they wiwll never know the meaning of life but teif they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that is havi problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willing to work not knowing they are going to be compensate it because they ill be compensated not nessarted materiolistically they will bem on then when they are xpect it they will beem recompensate d somewhere but the thing is to lend em open hand not knowing well jee what is for what is in it for me o what is in it for you is id then tangible are you willing

Recording: (6593/ 9618) 
you know it is you know 

Recording: (6594/ 9618) 
uh i was a little bit on the pift side yeah i 

Recording: (6595/ 9618) 
well i do not know the people that i see around um you know they are grownups 

Recording: (6596/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6597/ 9618)

Recording: (6605/ 9618) 
i know that is why you have to get it recorded  it it would be nice to have more than one concert but uh they they just they are on a shoe string they really are they get most of their money i think by well probably if you count  in kind contribution thet westr uh auterbon college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space and uh the salary the conductor uh so that is a huge amount of money that they put into it and what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra so sometimes we have sdent college students play in the orchestra especially string players because they do not have a college orchestra uh but once in a while we will get win players that play in it also and uh sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something you wanted to play 

Recording: (6606/ 9618)

Recording: (6732/ 9618) 
and just you know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it was always something differenta i got to be outside and it was just a lot easier to do 

Recording: (6733/ 9618) 
it is moreo our society than the guns i believe it is more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 

Recording: (6734/ 9618) 
umum 

Recording: (6735/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6736/ 9618) 
ohokay 

Recording: (6737/ 9618) 
um i i i when i was going up i had had a whole kllerof cats 

Recording: (6738/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6739/ 9618) 
if not you just get there the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff but it is interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like there is this huge place and you are going to get that no matter what and this and that but when you obviually go and look around it kind of 

Recording: (6740/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6741/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6742/ 9618) 
yeah and yeah and i would not do that i if i was you know had no children and 

Recording: (6743/ 9618) 
so you know uh it it is pretty pretty busy there but it it is spread out over the sixteen hours as whereas port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes in an hour is time so 

Recording: (6744/ 9618) 
umhu 

Recording: (6745/ 9618) 
nd they are like wow let us do this too we can make school you know let out for a little bit i they might not be doing it to um 

Recording: (6746/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (6747/ 9618) 
mean what their fends did and what they what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as as anything that that the schol could do but i know the school school is a very powerful force in a kid is life you know i mean it is a kidis life 

Recording: (6748/ 9618) 
well it is kind of hard he would see  he is got two other kids and one kid he had while we was together that he does not see at all 

Recording: (6749/ 9618) 
ih 

Recording: (6750/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6751/ 9618) 
well how he felt ind knowing that we were not neglecting him or two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (6752/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6753/ 9618) 
um yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 9618) 
no not at all i would have rather voteed for mackan over bush because bush he he comes from a political family whichi am not saying is wrong because the kenedies were a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like he everything is been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going to di n try that question over and over and over if he did not do it heu might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (6755/ 9618) 
no  actually i was uh going to get my gd after that 

Recording: (6756/ 9618) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and polers and umm um i do not know it is northland is uch uh a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know um um a hurting  or you know a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both i mean there is lazerus everywhere theye re seers everywhere or not why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to pollers if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah we will probably move within the year umhum 

Recording: (6757/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (6758/ 9618)

againt gets back to being in home did your mother give you everything you wanted it then she failed you did not she 

Recording: (6761/ 9618) 
and of course i think too as in america the uh the farm families you know they wanted that was more labors for the vinyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that but over the years it it uh it just made sense to me ind fact it looks like in my family that they are going to the children are going to be mostly and twos you know not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are forty two and forty oh soon to be forty one so uh i think that their child bearing years are over 

Recording: (6762/ 9618)

i got oneer 

Recording: (6899/ 9618) 
wel that basically iis they were you know as youar in plucks of people move out or city limits and everything you know then uh you know you got to have places for them to shop and everything and basically the northland lalw has been there forever jacaob who owned indians owned it uh he never did anything to it you know so you golire er laserus your penties and uh main stay places that generally moved there becauuse of the uh years ago because it was something well it was breake ter wirh with with a lot of people popultion n everhey and then like i say if fyewou gonw if yo got basically the people moving out to get away from the the traffic and all that stuff you know not that they are moving away from it they arestill getting into it but te it is just your perspective uh uh then you have to if you built it they were com they say you kno soumhu umumu and i guess he is still going to built it so 

Recording: (6900/ 9618) 
some of them are pretty good at that some of them are not toohum some of them like when you have them copy like up from this box down to this box these little shapes in a certain amount of time if their visual perception is messed up they screw that all up they you know the form goes this way they draw it this way their brain flips it around on them that is why they have trouble with ends and nes and bes and ds and they are still reversing you know you normal kids that goes away about aige eightd my kids hey are still doing it you know they are still may or they might make an eight from the bottoem up instead of from the top down or a six from the bottom up i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up you could tell by watching them right that their brain did not work like yours did 

Recording: (6901/ 9618)

Recording: (6904/ 9618) 
i mean i some ways i think competition is a bad thing because in our society it is usually not fair some one always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but i mean i like the fact that we have got this super high tec tape recorder not a big reale o real thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a a computer internet rather than like going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are that are not in our library and then where do i go from there um i like being able to look oh likebreare if congress has it i will jut drive out to washington or have them send it here you know um that i think is a major contribution of the past generation uh

Recording: (6920/ 9618) 
well i know with myself when we had pe always says that it was not for me he would have gotten just two emmersed in his job because he is really involved you know he likes what he is doing hhis tremendous responsibility and but he loves it but the thing is when the kids were little too you know i was always having to pull him back and say do not forget you knowthey are going to grow up fast if you if you do not spend this time and now i mean like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he is been at this for all these years and i do not have to do that anymore i mean someplace along the way about ten years ago he got so involved in their lives but when they are little 

Recording: (6921/ 9618) 
let us see yo usually go out to lunch at like some fast food place and then we get together and cook dinner

Recording: (6932/ 9618) 
rit well not just one my older brother would have been two and a half or three 

Recording: (6933/ 9618)

Recording: (6936/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6937/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (6938/ 9618)

Recording: (6941/ 9618) 
e 

Recording: (6942/ 9618) 
that ws all i knew 

Recording: (6943/ 9618) 
that is exactly how iam when you said what would i do you know i might do hos i might just go totchool some i used to own a galary i might do something like that again you know there is just like there is just villions of projects out there waiting to happen and so it is just 

Recording: (6944/ 9618) 
it is just the sp the spiritual aspect there is a relm even instine the most brilliant man supposedly mathmatically of our time uh even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory 

Recording: (6945/ 9618) 
that would probably affect my decision a little bit 

Recording: (6946/ 9618) 
yeah they are gongo it is a spring break a couple ofth teachers are taking a bunch of kids 

Recording: (6947/ 9618)

Recording: (6961/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6962/ 9618) 
so how u this works out you know i do not know im just i am just like okay she just says i just want to get it over with and see now she you know

her and her mother  went and seen it andeveything we were divorced at the time and uh then i went and bought the movie and 

Recording: (6967/ 9618) 
and then how satisfying wis that to them  ihmen you have a chance to talk to them that is where we need to learn more from interview have more meaningfl interviews wofth these people so that we can learn from them wey put themn on spot lighke but we some hal we donot do not want to uh i guess flood themg with the we do not want get the negative answer because i all might hurt the image of the university oh gee oh wew who as it cats and lawyers we wel we eh well hey we realize that the university only wantsplayers here to draw gate money what is what wey wan to do whey de not here or academics they do not talk about academicswhen they re oming to he higho state 

Recording: (6968/ 9618) 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital um those things happen 

Recording: (6969/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (6970/ 9618) 
uum 

Recording: (6971/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6972/ 9618) 
a lot of people have switched from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the party animal 

Recording: (6973/ 9618) 
um i would tend to say most people i know are at least fairly ethical i mean there is no more sinister group than the other that i know 

Recording: (6974/ 9618) 
eventually 

Recording: (6975/ 9618) 
he works he 

Recording: (6976/ 9618) 
um i think so i think partial birth is not such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever comes up but i with so many things it is it is like a it is a foot in the doorif we can do that then we can say well you know maybe not in the third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and 

Recording: (6977/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (6978/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (6979/ 9618) 
i have almost been hit i do not know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turning with no turn signels 

Recording: (6980/ 9618) 
there there is a we access to some of our systems em and that is all of them we are mre puttig a more uniform on up for everything and i do not it may be they oh issou has iis own system but they can also connect our system for things they do not have in their system i ean tit is so i am not sure what system you are talking to 

Recording: (6981/ 9618) 
yea 

Recording: (6982/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (6983/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (6984/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (6985/ 9618) 
yeah yeah yeah and you can not ignore it i am because you know because that is something else when i was in high school i do not think i knew the word but um now evey everybody knows u i am anybody who is a little bit different is likely to be called a fagget  and and so it is better if you can defuse that but i boy i would not know how to approach it i mean i think it should be approached but wooh i would not have a clue 

Recording: (6986/ 9618) 
l yeah like lie five hundred people in alectur hall yeah 

Recording: (6987/ 9618) 
umhum yeah  im two thirty five 

Recording: (6988/ 9618) 
u 

Recording: (6989/ 9618) 
the united states knows about it they sit there and e pay to welfare they will not do nothing to him 

Recording: (6990/ 9618) 
l right real war 

Recording: (6991/ 9618) 
right and it is all the bucks an because people i work with you know uh thereare there are some people i work with at house payments one guy he is the biggest twenty two hundred dollars a month and a lot of them have like fifteen hundred and up and you know i bought my house years and years ago it is like four eighty five and i would not daire tell them that but  it is like you know t because they are always  you know there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and and they are always like broke but yet you know like when they go do something they have got to have the best of everything the best u it is like you know you know you uh to me you just have to kind of think about things a little bit and it is like you know do i do i really need to go to uh what would i say um uh tgi fridays for lunch and spend twelve dollars or kind of go to talk abell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like uh book for my kid or you know uh they have like my daughter is in swimming i need the money fora swimmin suit well why do not i use it for that you know so it is 

Recording: (6992/ 9618) 
because it is more open u and you couch it in terms of civil rights um my boy friendis thinks hit is wrong morally but does not think we ought to be discriminating against d he he thinks it is a sin therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through you know talking to them religion wise um i do not think it is a sin i think that um your sexuality is genetic based and that i you can no more change your sexual orientation and you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different um whatever those iy pieces are contacts i do not wear glasses so i can never remember those terms um but that is just cosmetic and anyone who tris to change your sexual orientation that is cosmetic too uh and again uh my belief is whatever happens between concending adults is their business not mine um  i do not know that anyone could change it a what was your question again 

Recording: (6993/ 9618) 
uh wander around to look at things 

Recording: (6994/ 9618)

Recording: (7031/ 9618) 
um i would like to teach um iman the the field is particularly saturated right now so i am not holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i would like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job but i mean right now those jobs simply are not available so uh i am approaching things like whatever happens happens i am going to pursue my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after i finish my schooling 

Recording: (7032/ 9618)

Recording: (7073/ 9618) 
well it is kind of it is kind of hard when you have got your your limited choices here you know some of uh some of the issues i thought were kind of important but when you are looking at the maoal candidates did you watch that debate 

Recording: (7074/ 9618) 
because it stopps your heart right away 

Recording: (7075/ 9618)

Recording: (7077/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7078/ 9618) 
and 

Recording: (7079/ 9618) 
umhum but there is things that are difficult like they are uh there is the where we go we we have a temple too and they can not go in the temple well they can but they have to bt fit certain criterea they have to be baptised and not and follow these health codes and all the different coades and but that is not what they are interested in doing so and and that is hard i think and like going on a mission really they did not understand that they are m dad just like do they know how small you are  there is sayding you to scyberia and so 

Recording: (7080/ 9618) 
well when you think about the different generations and things we certainly did not have that things to worry about that people do now you when i was in elementary and juniourhud a we would ave never dreamed of anybody haveiangn good gunor even lat alone on nife i meand that and that is violence an thatis that goes back to kids and how much time and and effort you put into them you know kids a are ignored and pushd aside and they are in the way and there is so many people that do not even want them and you know and then they get into school and they get violent and they they take it outh y you know and everybody i surprised you know i am not because i know there is a lot of anger anre a lot of hate for these little kids and um and go in to school it is getting to be so dangerous i think be cause you have so many of them and one little room and they are comeing from so many different backgroun and if you take each one of their situations ui can bet the statistics as time goes on that theye de they are not going ta have one caring parent you know maybe not even one of the parents you know they might have a foster family ore you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there is a lot of the people that that are foster families that only want the money you know and and theyre is all that so it is it is really scary and i think i think that i something has to be done real fast i do not know what i think it starts from what we teach them and as adults to what we allow to be out there the computers i mean uhh my gosh ii did not even get a computer because i was so afraid of what they could be able to access theyre was not you know they was no think bared at all when they first came out yeah and you know where are all those softweare people theye are not responsible for why to cay they are not responsible for you know all thes and hey are nor access to all this stuff so it is really hard

Recording: (7092/ 9618)

um originally north side 

Recording: (7119/ 9618) 
people that just uh really want to teach as opposed to like i do not know why other people want to like even whent into teaching at all you know but um i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so this is you know you do thisd to get this certain grade it is like you do this to learn this because it is interesting as opposed to like and i do not know i think it is like there is a lot of things that it is more ke compulsary education is weird like being forced to take this class like i think that if i but i mean it is good to being forced to take a like a liberal arts thing because yo like you do not know what you wiot want to do so it is like if like you hate math and you do not take it at all but then you decide you want to do something math han you are like screwed like can not go back 

Recording: (7120/ 9618)

it is a real different thing i mean you can understand why it would be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when you know you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but he used to always he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that i would not have to deal with it the whole time 

Recording: (7161/ 9618) 
umhumba 

Recording: (7162/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (7163/ 9618)

Recording: (7165/ 9618) 
you know whand i hear about kids twelve thirteen n  luckily i was not that early but um i think once they start you know like sixth grade they really should relate to them

umhum 

Recording: (7168/ 9618)

Recording: (7187/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7188/ 9618) 
they think everything they say is helarious oh it is just middle school i think it is transitioning from childhood to adult hood is a tough time and um when you have all the other things going on like you can not read and you can not rite and you can not spell then it is just even worse is i it is exasterbated even more so i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 

Recording: (7189/ 9618) 
i think outside of the honerst program a lot of it is but within the honerst program i thinkthere is some really really exceptional things going on 

Recording: (7190/ 9618) 
oh yeah yeah 

Recording: (7191/ 9618) 
and at is very hard my wife and i but we will get through it

Recording: (7194/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7195/ 9618) 
i do hope that she does she is a good writer i do hope that you know some day she can be able to do that 

Recording: (7196/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (7197/ 9618) 
yeahandoe no 

Recording: (7198/ 9618) 
yeah and i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen in high school so we kind of grew up together and i did not know anything else and um just two complete different people you know different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (7199/ 9618) 
oh you did not 

Recording: (7200/ 9618) 
do i do with what 

Recording: (7201/ 9618) 
and he is very oppinionated and it is interesting when he talks about uh anything he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing uh you can tell that he is thought his thought about it and has you know clearly formulated what his stant is on it au theis very articulate aboun it uh sometimes it his response is veri mature but he is nineteen 

Recording: (7202/ 9618) 
sany time for money yuess 

Recording: (7203/ 9618) 
well obviously i sort of surmounted that because i have been you know ihae spent a lot of time there since then i think had i only studied there for a semester or a quarter i would have come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then you know after that you know you just sort of you know get to the point where you just kind of you know laugf it off and just think oh here we go again and then 

Recording: (7204/ 9618) 
some ideal ideas about it so i a i figureit something i should know about so 

Recording: (7205/ 9618) 
adoption is different i think the wit tet when adoption is entirely different than when you conceeve wi somebody else as spirm or somebody else is whatever uh because iadoption means that  i can not have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and you aregein you are reaching out to your friend you re neighbor you are not just forgetting about him thand let the welfhare somebody take care of themhe and let them go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is  and and you are really accepting this responsibility and tat islep and when you are trying and willing to have well some people would probably aregue about this but i am sorry if godt did not mean that i can conceeve n have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside of me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs  needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already a ware to a certain extent of what jeans say you might have enherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not it later on you w find out but if still you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are going to be able to trace tees jeans back and say you know i later on if something happens that this child you are having and find out well what did they inherite over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

Recording: (7206/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (7207/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7208/ 9618) 
he knows eg show picture wen all that is who man choers somw 

Recording: (7209/ 9618) 
well we do not want to know she is the only one that wants to know her her um boy friend he does not want to know either and so sara decided that she could not go and find out the  sect of it because she could not keep as secret yet so so anyhow we do not we just do not know 

Recording: (7210/ 9618) 
wow um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community base programs getting but again those are my values i as not say steering the kids into a church base program if they can not be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them givething them the guidencse that they need the wymca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs 

Recording: (7211/ 9618) 
german yeah 

Recording: (7212/ 9618) 
i do not think we need eight months and we need to start the campain even a year before the primaries it is just too long uh people start tuning out and there is anlay so much you can say and tit is like the candidates 

Recording: (7213/ 9618) 
and i do not agree with that either 

Recording: (7214/ 9618) 
i thought i would expect that from dogs i mean yeah a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff but in brod daylight 

Recording: (7215/ 9618) 
i know i do i do nt i mean i start 

Recording: (7216/ 9618) 
umhum well i had ta driver down here last time s   oback because she has not come back i wo as well gowi  i am just skitddy we wede to get sub to eat i ropped her off and she took the bus home so u we are talking about wr 

Recording: (7217/ 9618) 
my dad like 

Recording: (7218/ 9618) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black pople on tv and then you starte seeing a couple of black people on v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found the jefferns offensive ind many ways because it wase sterio typical and made fun of of of black people and many ways in retrouspect it was trend setting and what it did and and even in putting blacks in um advertisements on tv young kids saw them uh and and saw those ads and saw those tv programs and so it became uh a part of every day life uh and the more you see something the more it be becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of sterio typical um but i am sure it does have uh some influence because it i think it did it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzle that that helps i think matheu sheperd helped also 

Recording: (7219/ 9618) 
right i think teaching band might be fun because i i think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory a band and it had mostly to do with whether you were thereor  whether you were well behaved yeah and whether you are trying to play your instrument  i i do not think we ever got as bs and cs  yeah 

Recording: (7220/ 9618) 
i have not been anywhere except for canada and uh um niagra falls i was about three years old you know that is when my dad died wawe was up here no less so 

Recording: (7221/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7222/ 9618) 
n 

Recording: (7223/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7224/ 9618) 
you know somebody lied to you buddy he said they were just looking at him like you know no way  they were like no 

Recording: (7225/ 9618) 
right right 

Recording: (7226/ 9618) 
rght 

Recording: (7227/ 9618) 
violence 

Recording: (7228/ 9618) 
i i i i do not think it is necessary to that i think it just comes back to the lack of self discipline 

Recording: (7229/ 9618) 
cos 

Recording: (7230/ 9618) 
uh the reason that it was one of the best years of my life ws  san i incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people and it was mostly af cearst young people but they were incredibly ideallistic and incredibly searching for answers and um i mean theire questions in their conversations talk about opinions  as matter of fact ta that is onlything i felt difficult about about living there was they would be asking all these inredible questions and i would be trying to do the dishes oromthing mting like that as like i do not want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions 

Recording: (7231/ 9618) 
they are supposed to be not physically possible goes against the first law of physic but i saw it happene 

Recording: (7232/ 9618) 
so that works out prettywell 

Recording: (7233/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7234/ 9618) 
the beginning of the end  yep um grop in upere arlingtonm not sorry yeah really those five miles make such a difference though like because i yeah because i live on campus 

Recording: (7235/ 9618) 
tho things are horrs how d scratch 

Recording: (7236/ 9618) 
you know so unfortunately you know a i guess i never thought of it a lot more pressure is put on schools ind education now 

Recording: (7237/ 9618) 
where they can go every day the way i look at it also too uh when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was fourteen you can not even find a job unless you are sixteen nowadays 

Recording: (7238/ 9618) 
um it is considered urban  but because it is north of acr and we play like a lot of lhike the inner city like in accrian schools but in my opinion it is suburbia like but we have the we have the big city problems like there is a lot of drugs and i think that is just because the building is old so no one really takes pride in it and then it is two thousand people 

Recording: (7239/ 9618) 
weland when he first started out 

Recording: (7240/ 9618) 
right right 

Recording: (7241/ 9618) 
graphic design in particular after i quit restling i got really into computer so i pretty much live on my computer now 

Recording: (7242/ 9618) 
and my sister was here like i said and then moved out just gone came back a coupleof months ago um my grandfather just passed away but he was here in a nursing home for about a year 

Recording: (7243/ 9618) 
yeah i thought it was going to be  like not so structured but it really is and like especially i mean it i know it is like all first year classes are basically the same and it is just kind of like how i do not know i thought it would be different like more of uh like more of an adult type thing when really it is just they treat you exact same way like u not know yeah  i think that is true and like i lived in the dorms too and i really i realy did not like that like it was like i do not know it was like living in a hotel or something it was really weird and like 

Recording: (7244/ 9618) 
have x umhum 

Recording: (7245/ 9618) 
because there is some people that actually can not work 

Recording: (7246/ 9618) 
right yep but uh fifty dollars a week 

Recording: (7247/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7248/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (7249/ 9618) 
i do not know i had not thought about that um a i n no i do not i do not get the impression the values has anything to do with what they are doing in this school 

Recording: (7250/ 9618) 
but um 

Recording: (7251/ 9618) 
they will also give them let them work seventy five percent if they are sick i had a hard attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave and i like i said ihave been here twenty five years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it was not a good enough reason 

Recording: (7252/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (7253/ 9618) 
they always find some silly way to slant his words and make him look bad and it is really disgusting i mean 

Recording: (7254/ 9618) 
um i know that is a lot easier said than done because you fall in love veryigreeg sometimes when you are young um but i do not think it encourages it i just think in you know they show so much on tv it is all you know people are newed on at ten oclock at night on these shows and these girls are watching it  you mean granda most of them are adults but on the soape oppers and stuff it is a different story so they are seeing it anyways um you just i think if you are open enough with your children these parents and say you know we we want to give you this option we really prefer you do not do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 

Recording: (7255/ 9618)

Recording: (7327/ 9618) 
uh i do not know i do not remember 

Recording: (7328/ 9618) 
i mean i think he is done some positive things i ha whole thing about um uh u as far as like youre student loans and being able to get ioi help me you know and i think you know all this thati it is far as some of the issuej go i think that that i feel a pret these soam lir acto the way he doys um some of his foreign policy things i think i have gone pretty decently but i mean i think i do not i do not know i mean i i do not know if e if it really if you reallyi if feel like tha teve hat whole health care thing which and o thing ever happen with really you know and i think these people have a lot of relly gery i deas but they do not they do not hever a really put ting anything into action d it is kind to skate along you know and i do not know if there is anything substantial ike caun say that was a wonder ful thing that you dod that i fel very affected buy it umconomy is fine i mean so it is not that he is feal he is doing a horrible job but i do not really know how much you uld actually doing you know and i think that unfortunately spend a lot ofer time trying to get out of i do f personal its youis that you have got and youe se al ifmeint tu and you can not really focus on any thing that is thait is positive that you want to do for for the kiuntry and i think i think it is just too bad because i feel like if i was presidentyo knoi that i whant to be president but you know you  have three or four things that you think ware very important you wu you would hi er a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very combbudy that you feally thewl actually be able to accomplish some things ind you  really work tink get some stuff don you know and i do not know wif it is if it is just because you know you have to get a greement from all the other all the every body else in government before you can pass anything or or why you know why do not thinks things get takekcin care of i mean there is so many different issues that people want to look at and yew end up focusing on things like fillip mor you know just like a bage et thing in the whole world you know and and there i so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are that are important i just i do not know may i meank i do not i do not i am not real up on every thing that is been done but i guess it just kind of seegs like i wish people would be a littl bit a more fobcauss and yo and you would be able to say you know this is w there is these three things that i think are really important that i am really gon to work too make sure that they get taken care of and and i do not i thit is think people kind of lot yo dodan and say well this is it is like thas you know well we will see what we can king to do about it and them will you know 

Recording: (7329/ 9618) 
well see my my husband would do that tho it is so bisare because is i do not know wa i i onictlly do not i think that is where his brain is completely lacking i make i get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can not do and we all understand this and it is perfectly fine and he says i am not a good judge of that you will have to check what because my son when my son was like eleven he let him come to campus with his scape boarding friends i said where are they ih will do so they were going down on ka i s  campus or my dead body you know he is not allowed down there 

Recording: (7330/ 9618) 
i listen to someone i just touch someone who will be successful you will be successful i th individual and that is what is most critical you yourself hase to do it not the business because from you businesses observe 

Recording: (7331/ 9618) 
and we know that the result could be death then like and it an it is an agressend and agression thing one side will be the aggressor one would obviously because you can not have two uh two aggressive things uh uh naturally one would be aggressive f and then one would be aggressive and it is response you can not you kowat i mean so in like a state of war tit was like that so in that context i think but like in the same contect i feel  it would be wrong for a solder to kill a civilian because they did not um they did not decide to become a combattant so if you are a if you are combatant and you make that decision or you are drafted which that that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted so if you choose to be part of that society that i mean that is a little shadier but still if you are if you both make the the desire to do it then soi if i were drafted i think i would fight i am sure i would fight for the country or you know but i do not think i would go think you know i just do not feel the need to go on evermpage or anything 

Recording: (7332/ 9618)

Recording: (7392/ 9618)

Recording: (7396/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7397/ 9618) 
yes um well i was raised most of my life in ashland it is about ten minutes north of mansefiled ohio and um i uh we moved there we moved there from mancefield so i have been living in the mansefild ashland area for a 

Recording: (7398/ 9618) 
i think yeahs 

Recording: (7399/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (7400/ 9618) 
there was an indemp story about that i think it was i do nt wate is harper is magazine or what it was in a uhu a significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation andi i found that quite interesting and very very impressive uh  as a matter of fact whatever it was i remember sending it in to the uh city counciluh of date you know i just addressed i 

Recording: (7401/ 9618) 
the she is you know half naked  and she is should be a center fold somewhere you know and those are little yeah disney movies cartoons i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it is really scary um but nobody is doing anything about it that i can see and they do not really see a concern but like i said wait until the generations start growing up wait until those little kids that weve put all those things in their head grows up then they will think how whe should have done something ind well i am i am scared i hope i do not live real long bc it is it is scary well and then the guy that um i do not even remember what his name was he got a drunk driving charge a judge he was a judge now he is out he went back to work on monday 

Recording: (7402/ 9618) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different clixes but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something at like that that you know had to have been more than jus you know sort of normal joks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even ou know i went to a private cathlike high schools but even there you know there was you know uh a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not i have been going on and that was only on a very small ofer there were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like severeal hundred students that this happened at so 

Recording: (7403/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7404/ 9618) 
you know i i said to myself because i had post pardem depression with my third and fourth child and i thought what good am i going to be to these children if i am not able to take care of them so the decision was that after the fourth child we would practice buiurth control so uh and i felt comfortable with that 

Recording: (7405/ 9618) 
ye i usually am  not quite there yet not really 

Recording: (7406/ 9618) 
no sunlight you know that and they do not give him they keep it warm andtn he is not allowed sheets or raiseris or you know other than an electric raser so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck ye there is nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me  would be tlike that to me he is actually like that has to be worse like just a aggony and the and u i think you would have to go and sayin like ter is realys so much you i woud actl for board games or something but like yhe ca doe not even hear a human voice because i think it is something like that was ritten in the scriptures like you are dead to the world for uh it is the worst that you can do and so tthe world sees him you know at im mean so that would be rough tat wouldbe real rough and so obviously he would want to um i  like they say like now like people that observe him he is likehe sings to himself and he reads the bible like every day and but like i do not know that would be strangewould beis such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being locked in a room for like few days 

Recording: (7407/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (7408/ 9618)

nd a lot of times unions uh they actually actually seem detrimental like to production and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because  if a union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that thac can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy a lazy union as a representative of of these workers so they are more apt to go outside

Recording: (7437/ 9618) 
umhum and all white jury 

Recording: (7438/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7439/ 9618) 
and the questions are not easy i mean i mean the i douht if i could pass some of them i mean i probably could pass the citizenship and the and the english and maybe the science because i like cience and i keep up win that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math because i do not teach math and i do not use math that much other than just normal you know adsubtract mot 

Recording: (7440/ 9618)

well and they had to cover their i know all of that but i do not think that is really been 

Recording: (7455/ 9618) 
or or somebody or or or later they will clame that i was coersed to saying that as i walked out the door you know and it is a big ly 

Recording: (7456/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (7457/ 9618) 
well i know people at sleep outside and uh  not all of them are betterans and everything but they theyre again they do not want to be a part of the quote unquote sheltered system you know uh staying at an open shelter voa or something like that 

Recording: (7458/ 9618) 
hum 

Recording: (7459/ 9618)

Recording: (7461/ 9618) 
i went to um for grade school andum for high school 

Recording: (7462/ 9618) 
or does thit say this you know this is what i thought this said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my six gritters turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and they are whether they travel and groups or aloane and what part of the world they mostly habitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestabules 

Recording: (7463/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (7464/ 9618) 
oh man 

Recording: (7465/ 9618) 
so um 

Recording: (7466/ 9618) 
thand i 

Recording: (7467/ 9618) 
existing area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7468/ 9618) 
light news uh that is why i read yu tend to reade alternative newspapers and things because you do get a different perspective it is it is probably just  slanted but it is different you are riht 

Recording: (7469/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7470/ 9618) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (7471/ 9618) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of rosas and those types of things you can get some that are older that need to need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (7472/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7473/ 9618) 
u 

Recording: (7474/ 9618) 
okay that is why they did a lot a lot oft like biological studies is thap barrwe okay  i have heard of it 

Recording: (7475/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (7476/ 9618) 
o you had wome that re working before you had women  wrking before but self dicipline is nat brik down on a family that is part of it self dicipline making things too easy for us oh we can not do t without it you ever you ever try to work for someting i mean you really struggle to atchieve something did it mean more to you than omething that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7477/ 9618) 
well i have a  maybe when i i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7478/ 9618) 
then my sister lives in the middle of nebraska  nobody visits body wants t go to nebraska yeah what is out there i mean come watch the corn grow 

Recording: (7479/ 9618) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of joibs about that i remember um driving to germany with a couple english friends and to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and it we were got lost and all these things that took us away along ago and it should have been a friend of the person we were visiting  said like oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonald is along the way and i was like  i i am a vegetarian i do not even eat it mcdonald is you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it is like that it is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said macdonald is would not survive here if no one ait there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7480/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7481/ 9618) 
the well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about um about the loss of the federal lawsuit against columbus 

Recording: (7482/ 9618) 
that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is where we learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are uh uh a parent getting a giving an allowance you do not give them to your kids uh money to do chores they d normally expect them to do but you give them something in addition to develup more responsibility  but we do not talk about responsibility in or societey to day i i i dare you to say we are n they say publicaly this is our bill of responsibility do you knowhre there is do weu talk about responsibility now 

Recording: (7483/ 9618) 
yeah and it is uh it is not too bad because i had to scratch off your ticket you gave me 

Recording: (7484/ 9618) 
i just well bt i did not understand as much as you probably  i justs like cluless as to what i needed to do to become an art major and i go to my advisor and they would tell me what to take and it was the art advisor but i did not really think i had to do anything special like i di not kno know about the port folio review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and then i just kind of went to clma state and went on admissionand then came back and so i just got accepted into that college but yeah 

Recording: (7485/ 9618) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have fined like one or two guns so and that to me t was but my high school i is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (7486/ 9618) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (7487/ 9618) 
i am on the computer at least six hours a day 

Recording: (7488/ 9618) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (7489/ 9618) 
does that make sense 

Recording: (7490/ 9618) 
like just like um like communal showers and stuff and like um just how it is like one room that you lke kind of live in or whatever you know it is more like like the army or something you know like real everything is real simple and everything is uniform and like i do not know 

Recording: (7491/ 9618) 
and she just came here and lived with me a year ago so she could have her baby here 

Recording: (7492/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7493/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7494/ 9618) 
yeah i think that is you know i am i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that that people fall through 

Recording: (7495/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7496/ 9618) 
ell i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun and waiys around the school you know that is the big thing now but just the you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support cleaw up through the administration and if they do have a they have to wait until something is pretty pretty agregieous before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (7497/ 9618) 
yem 

Recording: (7498/ 9618) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (7499/ 9618) 
i actually joined the church in uh well i do not know it was six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at osou and they were um just asking people if they thought that crist had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i  like well i think so yeah and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while tha i read the book of mormandn i really prayed about it and took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really that liked it and that was what i had been wanting so so that is how i decided 

Recording: (7500/ 9618) 
right because everything that has a cupon has tons of fat tons of shugar and is over priced 

Recording: (7501/ 9618) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him

Recording: (7511/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7512/ 9618) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (7513/ 9618) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yeah the special kid who has no area that he does not excell in like once i had a six grade girl who still ded not know r time tables and sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice and in every single school production she was the leade singer i had a girl once that went all kind of metals and jimnasticxs at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i have had kids who that got every bad you cing getting boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that they are really it might not be related to school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in the some other area like there is swimming or or scouting or whatever so they you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative sollutions than the normal person with a hundred or ninety five icu yeah i have seen them long enough to know that and worked with hem long enough to know that well like i have one boy who can not spell them he still spells at tach im and he took my computer apart the other day and at justed something in the mother board and put it back together now it works 

Recording: (7514/ 9618) 
he um traced frate whatever that means 

Recording: (7515/ 9618) 
and feed her and i go do not bother me i have had a bad day and i am tired you go watch tv and how are we raise ing children doing that you know yu know and people say  you have to have both those incomes because we have to do this and go why do you have to have a house that is three hundred thousand dollars why do you have to have a brand new car you know is not lie sacrifices are not are not you supposed to like do best for your children you know i mean i my children do not have everything they do not have a sayg you know my daughter has a car that goes to and it is twelve years old you know and i made her buy it i told hr i says i will not buy you a car i said if you want a car you have to buy it and i said wheand it is tie frorm maigtan ance you have to pay for it because she has to be responsible for things and she appreciates that you know and you know i admire her i mean she is the person i never was of that age you know s but you kno and i i do not take full responsibility for that but 

Recording: (7516/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (7517/ 9618) 
no 

Recording: (7518/ 9618) 
uum 

Recording: (7519/ 9618) 
yea 

Recording: (7520/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7521/ 9618) 
but 

Recording: (7522/ 9618) 
i am going to get done with this i swear 

Recording: (7523/ 9618) 
with the recycle uit is the way the indian people leave a many of the women refer to it as they are on their moon because when the moon is out the moon is that sacred and there is that that life women have that uh gift of life that they can give uh men can not do that m there is just a lot there that uh you know women go through that purification every month so women really do not need a sweatlong but it is there for that and they do participate um 

Recording: (7524/ 9618) 
but it just depends upon i still comes back to who you are now 

Recording: (7525/ 9618) 
and we were staying at his grandpas and his grandpah would sit on the back porch and say all kinds of racial slers towards black people 

Recording: (7526/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (7527/ 9618) 
oh yeah um yes and no they ar kind of weird ikett um one set of grandparents really i can not hear ever says anything they are a set on the other side that they are a little bit more racust um but at the same time it i do not know they almost set up like a double standard for black people they are black people that they really like and i mean theye are actually friends with some black people in they are black people that they do not like for whatever the reason may be and those are the people that they are racus towards i mean iis the same thing that goes with white people obviously theye are whike people that you can stand they are white people that are just obnoxious and you do not want to deal wit um i mean it is basically the same thing  r uh yeah u yeah yeah yeah exactly  um i really do not think we do for the most part i can not say i see any real big problems or anything like that that occure just because of the sex you are or anything i think that probably would cause a bigger problem than the black president um onestly u although i do not really see too many sexus problems li definitely do see guy is still being more like the de cision making type an as being like the final say and thing rather than women and i would see thame having an athority figure that is being a woman as causing problems to them 

Recording: (7528/ 9618) 
umhum it is real well nown 

Recording: (7529/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7530/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7531/ 9618) 
no the only thing that was really down there before i moved out was  lincon laveck tower  the shortest one  but oh but of course the university is just about the same in some ways his stadium and all that 

Recording: (7532/ 9618) 
oh yeah yeah we all get together we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because the nobody is house is big enough well and then we have so many little kids that it is great because uh we just go to a shelter inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and they can run around the kids run around and 

Recording: (7533/ 9618) 
oh my 

Recording: (7534/ 9618) 
right no 

Recording: (7535/ 9618) 
oh yeah yeah what religion are you  oh that one has all those those going ruls that do not work out in real life christianity yea 

Recording: (7536/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (7537/ 9618) 
oh what are you doing that for oh 

Recording: (7538/ 9618) 
um not really because i think you know if if they are going to they are going to and i do not think a lot of them at that stage i are going to go out of their way to go and buy them so i do not think it is like oh i have a condom i am going to have sex i mean actually it this is is very hot topic in england right now because they r they have got the highest rate of teen age pregnancy in the world and i mean their stories everywhere about you know twelve year olds having babies and i mean there they have gone to distributing condems on playgrounds which i do think is a little bit too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing they are there you know they can go and and get some or something but i think actually like physically you know passing them out is a bad idea but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think it is pretty important just you know because of the simple factor the stitistics that they are they are doing it so at least at the very at least they might as well be you know safe about it 

Recording: (7539/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7540/ 9618) 
yeah she still live with the amily 

Recording: (7541/ 9618) 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what but i think a at least for children especially because they have no means to to help themselves and like the parents obviously even if they are working a lot of times can not get health care for their children so i think at least for children b how many accidents happen to children like peple aways breaking arms and stuff 

Recording: (7542/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7543/ 9618) 
i do not know anything about the st oh man do not let the shirt fool you

Recording: (7547/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7548/ 9618) 
but uh she likes the spirituality of the community over there and 

Recording: (7549/ 9618) 
you know it if it does not affect them it is not there and if they do not have to 

Recording: (7550/ 9618) 
they do not get i do not think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council and they they raise money from the businesses in the community plus we charge for tickets for people to come and see us and sometimes it is sometimes we get a lot sometimes we do not get so many turns out the concerts we get the most u the biggest audience for are the christmas concerts where we have the children is quir  because

Recording: (7552/ 9618) 
he wants to yeah 

Recording: (7553/ 9618) 
i think they have got more money i do not know if that necessarily makes them a better school um i think a lot of it is is is really what you what as far as as a parent is what you expect your children to atchieve in school and what they want to get out of it you know my my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and and they took advanced ap classes and and they worked real hard and and they have got i think that they have options 

Recording: (7554/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7555/ 9618) 
okay well  a few years ago there was this big fuss a you know we have got to close some schools we you know enrolment is dropping it is you know just the way population goes enrolments dropping we can not afford to keep them all going so lit is close an it i his big study and e targeget is son to close well there was a big upror fom the people his kids went to that school like there will be whenever you close the school so the board back down and changed it s moin tand next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools but theyre was nod te money for it so there was a big fuss about that then two years later they come out with another study thi says whey they need to referbesure not some schools close a couple and then knock some down and rebuilt them and it is like every two years it is a different direction and it is like they are almost afraid to take a staing that somebody is not going to like well if you are going to shut a school down somebody is going to be really ticked off 

Recording: (7556/ 9618) 
yeah i have run into that a lot i think part of it was  high schooli wen to i mean i have gone to catholic schools all my life or whatever and obviously i have run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just do not have time or do not have the interest and just pay people to do it 

Recording: (7557/ 9618) 
it is like like sometimes do i think about people you know they call and and especially when i talk to the sometimes people call in and i i ta you know i get the same people or whatever oncein awhile especially if  like there is people have real specific weird names or somethingtg i can remember how they will call back and i wil think about i mean it is like how ii have this you know s like we have this weird like five minute relationship or something like that like every couple of weeks or something and it is like to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like and they youknow it is like it is real weird it is like u know u yeah everybody

Recording: (7618/ 9618) 
yeah i remember politial correctness 

Recording: (7619/ 9618) 
uhit 

Recording: (7620/ 9618) 
umhum

um i used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor and i used to go to work at like t eight oclock in the morning and get home for my first meal with jonney carson and i did thiss six days a week and to get my my one day off i would get upat like at seven oclock get my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car 

Recording: (7622/ 9618) 
there was one where they were going along and there is a little uh scrangy looking dog about s long and about thaut hi kind of foll on long after him jo i am glad that i finally see somebody i can be sorry for that is worth a worse off than i am 

Recording: (7623/ 9618) 
ohreally 

Recording: (7624/ 9618) 
i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over seys thi that is okay if that  th person does it to you i mean thereand my mother used to say if for every lall e was ritten there is another law ritten over here there we will actually knolify that one and i and actually as i have growing older i pound it and it is it is worson to thay is world as i said as the silver right is movbit and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderrers get away wit murder now by that plea bargin that plee bargin i think is  most think that ever was passed i do not think there should be any plea bargens and then oh pey is a wel would there people who wo get murdered oand i innonsaid to electric chair lectric chair i still believe in it because if someone is p and i do not bleved that they should have ten years of uh what dor they call that legal process where they can fer thin appeals  thank you that is it i do not think that he should have that either wone if peal or tw should be the limit if there e still pound guilty sorry and if an innocaent person has not been able tdo prove he is innocent that is just one of those freaky things that happens because some times innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that is guilty thate is  corrupetd enough bhat he is mined and he knows hy he get away with it ne get somebody else take he is blame but i do not they there is that meny innocent people thut ever went to they welectric chair that they should actually have knolifiged that because whoat right tis that person have to lipe tv just about two or three days ago and here is this guy downn the shiut then and as he is walked out and ceupped behined him and ta put ting him to cruser welre wat did to exsackally what i said i wis go to do a is go  s is t t whath sure draw heir last breath he killed her now he is got to go and p me be a plee bargin and he wil get off with thit because meybe he wad abused as a child and thit hed something to ot theway he wis thinking what happened to this woman becauuse of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid to penalty there would be more people thinking twice three fou times be fou thay did the same thing and that whald help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (7625/ 9618) 
that is exactly what it i 

Recording: (7626/ 9618) 
well i do not know that that is a cause u  it they they as a group uh it this was kind of a happenstance at it this occured as a result of a vhe major world war uh so na in terms of vhem causing it  it was it was a happenstance and an part of this mask communication we are talking about uh began with them and yes they are a major influence becu yo we are talking about numbers and you are talking about uh ah grea a grater inter communication i would like to go back one step or we are talking about when i mid mention the threedoors down you do not evebe know who that indi ijual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profownd as an individual communication we are nearing ziro in terms of global mass communication to everybody with inter personal communications that is the kee in my opinion personal versus inter personal communications a and and it zero over herr and were al most a hundred percent over here but when we are in this inter persional ore globale or masi what you ever term is the most appropriate uh jondow who speak here he has not the faintest idea who janedo is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah yi knewwho this person ride over here that is janedo that lives and that thiredout and she married hinrijacsion do nyrmember old henry we henterwas a guy live wey over there and the other side of town mas communications as it is today a have not the faiintest idea where jamecame from or where hinry jacion or where old whoeverwas lived over there i sad so i think i thi i i think cou need to disstinguish between the personal interpersonal relationship so maybe i dicres too far there or who thet next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7627/ 9618) 
el i see i am going to have to fall way back and chll my ege again as most people would cay uh i i would really like to see this to happen but i also know that it mo it will never happen within the next three or four generations but i i am of a guy who still believes that the lady has a place in her home and i do not believ that we need uh man and wife out working and making incomes as every won in the united states today fields they must uh hasal hit uppon it rather lately a while ago and is talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i my judgement is that we are spending today probably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they want and only twenty percent on what they need and that is all they need to spend on that need so therefore thene pardon 

Recording: (7628/ 9618) 
yeah i am i am opposed to parental concent um but i do not have kids so that is that opinion does not mean as much as it might from someone who did 

Recording: (7629/ 9618) 
oh really i had not heard thatyh now itit uh some of it went clinton is backed down i think i sort of summerize what i just said is you know for the health insurance and reform buth that all that health insurance area um yeah he backed down but it was not going ta happen so he could keep you know the feror going for months and months or years and still nothing was going ta happen it was the wrong time wen we tried to move on just something else uh i think it is regrettible it has not come back like you said it is like well i made the one attempt and did not go anywhere it is to lis let it drop and count for somebody else to pick it up well clinton said lame duck it is why cand not he bring it back 

Recording: (7630/ 9618) 
i do not think so 

Recording: (7631/ 9618) 
yeah just having fun 

Recording: (7632/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7633/ 9618) 
i do not think it ever really occurred to me 

Recording: (7634/ 9618) 
in uh first grade his teacher knew that he needed that but the principale would not allow her to do it uh that is one reason we put him in different school for second grade uh 

Recording: (7635/ 9618)

or they did not say loud enough that you had the right too why weas never told to hud the right you know i neverwa told like choe make the tellpphone call and if they can convince them and the poor policeman can not i think really what they ought to start doing is taping every thing that is said and taping it so it is so clear that there is no way that they can deny it and thend yet they have got that thing alowd it is illegal sival righe you can not tape han hem saying les is like  we signed the paper for you they get them to get them to sign whend they go in there you fully understand now what we are going to do and if boy if they say thatn they really make it so and asked them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they signe this even well then how could they say that they they they v they have gt to come up with new rules and theyve got to make the penalty stick

i am i have always lived in ohio so i am a native ohio and southern ohio umhum right now i am staying at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five year old and um my profession is a nurse i am a yeah but i have been taking a little while off since i have had the baby  umhum in um i i pretty much have picked up the belief in attachment parent tng since i have had my second chiold and i it is where you believe in brest feeding from birth ntil whenever and holding you know like carry in the baby in a sling with you and just being available for the baby is needs and just no not really  oh i i feel a huge difference for me personally um just in the um closeness in being able toh pick up on his cus a lot better and just knowing his needs 

Recording: (7753/ 9618) 
i believe them  i do i it is i mean it is a very personal thing and if that is what they saw most of my patients are het dramas so they can come up with some pretty wild stories but those visions are usually pretty clear and 

Recording: (7754/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7755/ 9618) 
no it would probably be something with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 

Recording: (7756/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7757/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7758/ 9618) 
there is not a lot around you know and we were on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our first kids yeahd they call well you still want to be on the list yeah we do not have any children but keep us on the list you know and it is like you say i is and there is three or four hundred kids in that day care it is a large day care but there is not a lot out there that is good quality you know i mean you it is scary and then you seeing the news uh u they were abusing the kids or you know and you do not want to go to work feeling that you are worrying about your kids and we have never really felt like that and we kind of work a little different shifts my wife and i so our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she does not start ntil nine thirty and i pick them up at four so 

Recording: (7759/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7760/ 9618) 
oh it is real negative she is real negative about things and and triys to put me down for being positive or you know i always see a way out of something and she does not and she i think she gets kind of mad n plase she feels like she is old at fifty and i said onht my gosh you do not even have any bad habits i said you know you could live to be a hundred that is fifty moure years you know i mean if you look at it that way she is really you know fifty is not old at all to me i mean that is just he as much as you learn you know you can not traide that but yeah my my one sister that is um exactly seven years older than mean we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know e on do so and she is she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but 

Recording: (7761/ 9618) 
yeah she she had to talk and my sister and i attend it and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little a scratch would go in you know a as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to bounce i am not sure how you would go about doing that because you donot want to put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7762/ 9618) 
read the paper and have the tvef there is something i think i might want to i might be interested in so i just do all those things and do my machine 

Recording: (7763/ 9618) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think ind todayis world what they call the nnities that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and t everything else we had standards and w there were certain things we did or did not do and then iy came along with it when our kids grew up then there were so many things hat change is some of the one thing i cun stainds out and this hiei d oething todo with politics but it is an example in in school they changed the way they were doing theirh mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geomatry in algibra you wol think you and i used the  straight ages in algabra when i got to geomadrat th why i my taking this so wy that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they aree teaching it entirally different now and i think linda explained to how they were doing it with matheyu and sayd she could not even help him und so you know it s in thee same way with politics it people i guess changed over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but then my mother used t say ing tn about our generation so i think it is just the sine of the times i do not know what it is 

Recording: (7764/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (7765/ 9618)

Recording: (7771/ 9618) 
that you really can get a lot out of it if that is something you want to do and i think as long as you are involved with the school

for example one of the issues that they were in the fourfront on was uh justice for um the people in central and lattin america yeah 

Recording: (7783/ 9618) 
well they pretty much put by the test schors they do not sit you down like in private schools they do this they sit you down one to one just like we arend they spend probably you know maybe twenty thirty minutes a day actually getting to know the student what the student still needs for the completion of that grade and once they figure that you are able to go there then up you go right up the ladder

Recording: (7800/ 9618) 
all i remember is them talking about contems i do not think they talked about anything besides that but um than again i could be remembering rong uh but yes that i mean it is the stande but i think in the schools i mean that is sort of like the the hard line at the catholic church but in the more progressive schools thore a little bit more realistic i mean this was not i mean it was the catholic school but we did not have nonsor anything there i mean um you know i think they were sort of more concerned with you know i actually it might have been later than the first um sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a couple like eighth grade that they  talked about condoms i douht that they would havedone that that early now that i think about it but i know that there was at one point you know some sort of

Recording: (7891/ 9618) 
yeah um umuh it is awareness again i mean you know put two and two together you get some young teachers right out o of college and then you put them with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean you can not even you can not control the attraction there but you can be aware of it and you can you can um put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the hight of their skirts and you know and they have got stairs up and down and you know they get in their lockers and they bend over you know and that is that is just too much i mean i think that is the first thing that has to be done take away that you know they should not even be and that should not even be a thouught you know and it is distracting enough for the the guys their own age but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they are single guys that we are just had a helllof the time in in college and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh well you know you got to look at that yo got to be more aware

Recording: (7896/ 9618) 
she does not so much mind anymore i mean since i have turned eighteen i mean ever since then it is been o problem or anything i mean she is sort of let me have my own opinion 

Recording: (7897/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7898/ 9618) 
right um personally i think it is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you con suppor you know and that but i come from a completelyly different you know background and everything else and the education thand a u you know than most of probably the people that this would um concert but i do think i i do not know i mean with the birth control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children that they can not feed they can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if you know the the men is not willing to do it or whatever so and an an addoption and all the other things 

Recording: (7899/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (7900/ 9618) 
you know 

Recording: (7901/ 9618)

Recording: (7902/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (7903/ 9618) 
control problems of course there is allwaysleake somewhay yeah well could be hot water they send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power planke but about now they drain thate it is drained for the summer togive us and opportunitiyty to work on leagues and stuff so they might have drained it an that is wake qui yean run quick put placti oh i do not know it seemed like it is a tough call because it is very unusual situation here to high state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in the union you you think of unions you think of ate workersyou think of pipe fitters you think of you do not think of such a wide variety of people and that is very hard to negociate for anybody you know when you are talking rasis and lotis of money like this what is what they were going for and the majority of the people in the skilled trades are not real big partiipators in the uniou you know we just ride along an from what i have seen over the twenty years i have been here is it seems that a lot of the union what they did was was keep the trouble maker employees around longger you kno and so we have really never had a lot of use for the union but recently we just figured out that you now if they decide to strike we have no choyce too and you can not work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line so you can nout work anybody they came back to work will lose all the money that they make they wil take then to cort ind o yeahs against yeah it is against the union contract so you had 

Recording: (7904/ 9618) 
um um they like me but then they do not like me

Recording: (7910/ 9618)

Recording: (7920/ 9618) 
yeah  just in their corporate offices and that would be fun so eventually i will have my own radio sn  if they interviewed me and do that they quick get that girl out of here no but that that is like the most exciting thing right now is that i mean that looks real promising but and if i do that then i am going ta have to do something voluntary or some uh voluntary work or uh choices i i loked at that too that is h choices for domestic violence that is an organization that i think would be real interesting and help mefeel like you know helping people um they give uh new direction for abused uh wives and mothers and um help them get on their feet you know give them the access to the different organizations that are out there basically hide them until they could get on their own because if they are abused the husbands are like you know a nightmare out there so things like that

um i i see it is a problem and and ifi if i if i were eferican american i would i would not like to see it simply because uh you know it it it is a  a child not being brought up in is you know in his tradition but on the other hand i hate to i hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orfanage when he could have a home and um i think u parents who were willing to a going willing to addopt uh a black child or a mixed race child or an asian child or any iare going to are going to be sensitive to the to cultural things because we are just you know it is just the the way things are slanted these days i mean diversity is an issue and people who are willing to venture out into uh mixed race addoption would already be way

Recording: (8069/ 9618) 
was not really living  i was actually serving a mission for my church 

Recording: (8070/ 9618) 
i think i did not know the difference so it did not in fact me at all i is just they are just another person um i think more  as i am being exposed to patience with the different life styles and knowing how to educate their care givers and what they need um i felt somewhat  ill equiped the first few times but um knowing what the expectations are especially like with spinal great injury patiense and when you go into sexuality and teaching them after injury i mean as a nurse you need to be able to educate them i felt pretty 

Recording: (8071/ 9618) 
and you screwed something up 

Recording: (8072/ 9618) 
we just started reselling

Recording: (8088/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8089/ 9618)

Recording: (8101/ 9618) 
he is 

Recording: (8102/ 9618) 
i know i know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leaway  but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an af finity towards certaint students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of uh not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much  yeah yeah 

Recording: (8103/ 9618) 
youdonot 

Recording: (8104/ 9618) 
and i i really feel like if you are going to run for president a united states you ought to be smart 

Recording: (8105/ 9618) 
there is yeah 

Recording: (8106/ 9618) 
no that is one thing that i you know iv found was really lacking here um for my son uh 

Recording: (8107/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8108/ 9618) 
he is really justt yeah he does not think through the implications that things real well in his personal lif 

Recording: (8109/ 9618) 
i mean obviously being u being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8110/ 9618) 
helps the cur 

Recording: (8111/ 9618) 
yeah i it says 

Recording: (8112/ 9618) 
was working out there 

Recording: (8113/ 9618) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (8114/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8115/ 9618) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8116/ 9618) 
combus needs that as much as people do not want other things to clothe i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (8117/ 9618) 
tikei to me that was very strange 

Recording: (8118/ 9618) 
oh she is cute she really is really cute i mean mean she is got big eyes and big flougfy cheeks 

Recording: (8119/ 9618) 
t is alway is going to be somebody it can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality and to account because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of suup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean it t is individuality again so 

Recording: (8120/ 9618) 
okay some people can like fly in do do their do their little wedding thing fly out 

Recording: (8121/ 9618) 
yeah it is weird they i know this microphone is a little bit different so 

Recording: (8122/ 9618) 
hat does not so much bother me it is just having it forced on me like yu saiy it just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 

Recording: (8123/ 9618) 
eah you even got these uh what stunt guns theyre to ons that scare me 

Recording: (8124/ 9618) 
yeah jacon and and i and i went together 

Recording: (8125/ 9618) 
umhum umhum 

Recording: (8126/ 9618) 
see that there again the business out box the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another trying to understand your neighbor more and spending time getting quaitly time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investment is gone 

Recording: (8127/ 9618) 
uhum 

Recording: (8128/ 9618) 
well that used to be where you know all the teenage teenagers went 

Recording: (8129/ 9618) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8130/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (8131/ 9618) 
um i mean i feel uh i leaned toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human right side was that if they are you know on cocain or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (8132/ 9618) 
because he well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talk about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (8133/ 9618) 
love it 

Recording: (8134/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8135/ 9618) 
no i mean the money you know the money is grat you know find it is the biggest rase they have ever geven anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they ave really settled for now as far ats because the sighning bones was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that yous start down at the hospital as a janetor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to maink campus you whauld make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and thand they did the rase and they wanted eighty cents that the hospital an a dollar on mank campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are hefinitely a separat budgetd you know the hospital i can see where they are comeg from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance polthems and this nd tha and they re thirty five million in the whole because they bogterase you east and all this but you know it is not the junion is foult that they are ran out thei contract you known you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people uh enterance wage is so low that it is hard to find anyboy that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place tobe the top ten and the nation or whatever is furancein but they are not welln to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always going te have to have people here to because contractors just do not drop what they are doing ind show up today and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have ritteng up the work order 

Recording: (8136/ 9618) 
well when you have formulas to make bombs and you know 

Recording: (8137/ 9618) 
umhum it sa it is at the same building actually it is it is that it is used for different things 

Recording: (8138/ 9618) 
yeah i was onler nineteen myi was eighteen when i went in but 

Recording: (8139/ 9618) 
exactly but i do therre there is the other side um th uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly you are giving up your children and and nd something has to be done but but there is also there is also thate i am i mean i think it is probably a legitimate fear that children or children of that group are going to you know going to be homoginized out of out of their heritage but i do not know uh you know theyare kids without parents 

Recording: (8140/ 9618) 
i mean they are gaz in congress they are gays and the military it s as long as people do noe know they they do not feel threatened see and and and i  i i do not understand that mind set i really do not i do not know why ua man feels threatened by having a gay near them um i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know want to gon to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the hight of arogance um you know but but man feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threattened by lesbians i do not know but  it is not a mind sat i have so it is hard for me to understand 

Recording: (8141/ 9618) 
four five six seven eight nine tens it just to get a volume level 

Recording: (8142/ 9618) 
okay i might want to try to adjust this a little bi again if you say it goes under n treck uand underherea tat hope yeah it is probably going o stay better

Recording: (8174/ 9618) 
no 

Recording: (8175/ 9618) 
yeah you still have to be careful then yeah 

Recording: (8176/ 9618) 
umhum i am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere along line t they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps it would not be long term and they would know that i would not be long term but that is that intangible i am saying you have somebody there because she is givving up her time and not tho make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bring about the spirituality and the person that is going to carry them all through life she is also uh tithing more than tithing probably which uh i always uh kidd with people i said the author  said ten percent tithing knew imflation he knew greayt about economics ten percent is ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we talk about economics uh little further here uh the japanesed so forth they save so much more and to un german and so fourth and uh boy you kno  taking a page alt the ole bible are not they we do not

Recording: (8216/ 9618) 
oh yeah it is so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and look in your house the neighbors right behind you you are staring at them sitting on their deck we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course uh so that is hard to find in the city limits because we are inside two seventis still so 

Recording: (8217/ 9618)

Recording: (8226/ 9618) 
i think it is good and uh i you know i think women are are capable of doing that my only disagreement with it is that i would have a real problem being in that box hole and have a woman beside me and uh if she gets shot you kni not know how it could deal with that it would be it men i do not know if you you you women hade you know different feelings but with about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other uh than they do with women everything nd they tend to be more protective

to melt and soften the metal so they could work with it um yes the air would help increase the temperature but a fire kept for a long period of time will be hotter than any kind of fire that you have ever touched or been around and that fire is sacred it is a sacred fire uh so that is why it is possible but if it if i went down there with the laws of physic told me that those rocks could not sustain heat yet i see when the fire keeper braks them out of the out of the fire pit and brings them in  the sweat loge ut there red orange glowing you are going no tell me they are not hot so that is that is one example um

Recording: (8365/ 9618) 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in thi sen and unseen i will never forget it because ihave recited it for god knows how many years but when you talk to them about posession when you talk to them about demons or spirits they freek out 

Recording: (8366/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8367/ 9618) 
umhum umhm bit uh t it was like i say i say  she prbably probably thinks the same way now she would been here you know nt haveing trouble with boys and everything you know when she is growing up ad no pari would uh could have probably whend have been an ass af bu that kind of stuff  depending on ha how bad they were you know they layed a hand on herff course you knoh ut but uh uh bu by here being a way you know then ed her mom is got a cool head on her shoulder she would not let that hav unless she told me about it and she would be probably be afraid to tellg me that ey would catch an air plane and fligt do o whether so youow tooked the guy up or somethin 

Recording: (8368/ 9618) 
o 

Recording: (8369/ 9618) 
um and i you know they said well what ifa for a health reason they said you would have to eat me eat there is no way someone could tell me that i would have to eat meat you know 

Recording: (8370/ 9618) 
yeah it was a home made bow and arro 

Recording: (8371/ 9618) 
our school was not really a violent one there were not really any fights or anything 

Recording: (8372/ 9618) 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lot of places they pick something that is sensational and keep they are making it even more sensational like when uh uh jon kennedy died 

Recording: (8373/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (8374/ 9618) 
yeah now if you the the the thing you ou do is if you know the callsigne 

Recording: (8375/ 9618) 
and then on out and the enemy was over there well they put us in the front of that mountain right down 

Recording: (8376/ 9618) 
his dad is a um well graduate of stanford um but he is um they they never leave there i mean that is a excellent medical school and everything but those football players they are smart theyot they do not they do not quit you know i mean it is amazing they they never do 

Recording: (8377/ 9618) 
um a lot of good investments a lot of saving a lot of living well below means and owning six business is yeah um his definition of retired is basically um he does not have to work he does but he does not have to so he just finished up a tempt job up at uh questy eu i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now 

Recording: (8378/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8379/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8380/ 9618) 
have you ever met somebody like that 

Recording: (8381/ 9618) 
well it is  well let us put it this way i can go out and make money without eveng making money o fo government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could i could be a crook and uh i could have people rut ind mey a house low income i could move in there 

Recording: (8382/ 9618) 
tv about it and everything that stuff is been going on for years uh 

Recording: (8383/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8384/ 9618) 
alkay so um christ and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got it in my head that i did not want anybody to call and say how wis your dad doing and so the best way to dea with that situation was to call him globaly across the board plus it was a fun pychological experiment just as as they go because how often do you get to tell people o dads killd thimself this morning so i i i hi how you do  it no i have not talked toyou a little while with eything  ikay i actually know my my father killed himself this morning youare kidding so you you end up after dols nd yourso people narrowing it down you have got you are kidding you are not serious no 

Recording: (8385/ 9618) 
just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother um and they were not allow dogs so  she is not allowed to go over there becaue she is always a butt but it does make a big difference so i guess that is what i am saying for them 

Recording: (8386/ 9618) 
yeah that is u the buraucuracy  would be too much of a strawbill i think 

Recording: (8387/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8388/ 9618) 
you know so they offer to do something to medschool here 

Recording: (8389/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8390/ 9618) 
it isart 

Recording: (8391/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (8392/ 9618) 
so 

Recording: (8393/ 9618) 
i have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (8394/ 9618) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with the with a bigger city when you get more people there is obviously going to be some more problems um an i mean that is really that is really all that i knowice it is obviously a lot more buld up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (8395/ 9618) 
nd that that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs becase that attracts fans people go  nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8396/ 9618) 
real positive about it but basically i i lived here for for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 

Recording: (8397/ 9618) 
i thought it was forty three 

Recording: (8398/ 9618) 
you puk up 

Recording: (8399/ 9618) 
uhhuh 

Recording: (8400/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8401/ 9618) 
uh and of course bille moldon was the greatest i mean you are have you seen his cartoons and but have not youh 

Recording: (8402/ 9618) 
throwh nerfballs int the audience and 

Recording: (8403/ 9618) 
as to what the sankso wer shoul be lke  so we had a tour uh the quier took a tour our quier director uh arranged it to about six five or six churches in the collumbus area to sing inuh and not for an audience but just to sing and ti see which ones we like te coos tixs of and uh that was intersting we sang and uh we sang in he centeral presbitrian church dawn town which is where this my one of my orchestras plays a lot and uh we sang in other different kinds of churchesnd said what we liked about ind what we did not  maybe it had some feet back i think that new building it is accoustically very good it is certainly much better than old werehp center becausei ndo not know if you have seen a picture or anything of the church but the old worchip center t was designed by a modern orkhitect to be a modern quote an quote type building in nineteen sixty two and it is yea it is it is flat there is a flat roof with ah clear story in the middle that has nothing in it just it is just empty space over the over the worchip center so when you would sing in that itis a cier spread out along the front if you were under the high place youre voice would go all all the way to the back but if you were under this flat ceiling it is only about seven or therte is only about nine or ten feet high it was ded it wamuffl  and uh it was terrible accousticaly  but you know we may do with it for many years and then uh and then we had the chance to get this input into this new building and it is it is uh it is really beautiful it is a circular almost circular big uht isspace with a high point in the middle of the roof and uh  it is it is nice  well you could still go it is they will not have they will not have a lot of uh 

Recording: (8404/ 9618) 
so yeah those places were probably about thirty years old i you know fire hazards insoulation just you know fire hazard everywhere 

Recording: (8405/ 9618) 
igt and i think that you know i think that it is just because you know you do so because i know i have done studies and i tooke some of those classes and you just think about it that way and i think a lot of these people just you know they say the nurse hays helpt ing you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kind of strange but i mean i think there is a lot of things that are pobably positive enough about it that i would want to do it for for a while as long as i could 

Recording: (8406/ 9618) 
uh well yeah whel librarians traditionally have problems with it is like a form of sensorship you know big brother things librarians have always had problems with that um i i do not know it is it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (8407/ 9618) 
um as far as my brother goes i can not say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town um but usuallyis either at work because he works full time then he has he is a part time student at collumbas state um so i do not really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out and does his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do no nd know but i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that 

Recording: (8408/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8409/ 9618) 
uh like here i have been it is on f you know  theyre they have been here for a while um then there was not any parties here for a little while and then uh i up bein the ones in cleveland since daton uh ackrin detroit new york pittsburg philadelphia

Recording: (8411/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8412/ 9618) 
um i meane fact of the matter is a lot of people out theree i guess could be child molesters or whatever i mean it does not matter if they are straight or gay or whatever the fact of the matter is i mean they are they are out there 

Recording: (8413/ 9618) 
i knowtice d my husband sometimes i mean we have taken joy out to the semitary a few times to go to the graveside of his mother and he says you know very often boy she would really have like to have been here and done things with him 

Recording: (8414/ 9618)

yeah 

Recording: (8465/ 9618)

Recording: (8466/ 9618) 
yeah that is what i mean they go by your age to 

Recording: (8467/ 9618) 
just because it is been three weeks now you know and not only that there is uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss 

Recording: (8468/ 9618) 
right umhum 

Recording: (8469/ 9618) 
umhum it is kind of frustrating but i am i it is agd it is probably good for me because i am so it is hard for me to just sit back and let other people believe whatever they want o believe you know i just want to convince them but i can not do that so it is a good exercise for me i wld look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (8470/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (8471/ 9618) 
oto bot y clear to be perfect le i was tar hee i juset noticed that it continued to decline all through high school and i was like you kn you should get out before you actually fail the class  and um it was it was just unpleasant i think i was stupid i think that is what it amounts to not that i was not nable to pick up the data i was just um not is uh unwise in in whether or not it was worth while  i believe that it is uh horribly worth while now and yet now i ame not taking classes so 

Recording: (8472/ 9618) 
to deal with 

Recording: (8473/ 9618) 
i mean the way i grew up is probably like back in the day like catholics against the collumbus publics you know like the ritchies against the poories that is how i kind of see but when i went to northland people are think northan is like a rich school but the way i see it is no not really i mean we do live in a big in  housed area you know the houses are like huge but um i mean columbus publics they they got some work to do to like the other night i was watching tv and uh an elementary school overdoaced a kid on like some uh i think it was a drug to com him down so he is not so hiper and they like overdoced him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mome is even overdoaced n he because he they are overdoacing him 

Recording: (8474/ 9618) 
and we monitor what they watch television wise we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to keep them interested in books and

Recording: (8501/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8502/ 9618) 
ll like i am a philosipfy miner so like if you look at like different ethical theories and stuff like you like there is a higherarky kind of this is what i have found there is a highrarky of things that are uh like the inalianable rights for intstance like i can not if you come in to my house and rob me and then run outside i not gong an i do not like to kill you for stealing my property like there is a higherarky there uh for stealing another life that is why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is inalianable the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other it s so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because with out that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the hghest thing and if it is inalianable becauseis i di not give it to you i can not take it back you never forfitted that you never gave me that right so that is what i feel like i could never want that you now to kill another person or 

Recording: (8503/ 9618) 
but it kind of helps actually because uh you have all the people in there who are not owners and they do not know how to like the partiers they do not hove to study or anything so

Recording: (8512/ 9618) 
short uh sa for for a test and um but the way that i would grade those would be pretty cientific i think  you know i would come up with a rubric and i would say you you need to have you need to mention certain things and i will give certain points for herr mentioning certain things  yeah i have i have never been a i have never been a teacher wre who is had to assigne or grade creative writing iam not sure i would t know how to do that yea

Recording: (8522/ 9618) 
which i she said that and i said 

Recording: (8523/ 9618) 
um heis probably been married for four or five years 

Recording: (8524/ 9618) 
yeah most of them 

Recording: (8525/ 9618) 
u 

Recording: (8526/ 9618) 
ote really 

Recording: (8527/ 9618) 
oh  i do n what dod it mean well it is you instead of going to your classroom you go into a room where you have you sit and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can not talk or anything 

Recording: (8528/ 9618) 
i am guessing 

Recording: (8529/ 9618) 
i had somebody call and they were doing a survay and they want to know what i did for living and whan i told them they said well we are done 

Recording: (8530/ 9618) 
um does not just because you send does not mean you are going to hell 

Recording: (8531/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8532/ 9618) 
and just because youar i meaw i was not really uh an athletic i did play uh sports when i was not in high school but i wa dancer  was not any good you know as tas n like other guys but whether i did or whether i did not you know i would i do not i do not nobody picked on meu kno i mean one time i got into it w with one of the uh centers in football you know a big old guy and been uh  and i w  still about seing sise but 

Recording: (8533/ 9618) 
yep  yeah i am not married i am single 

Recording: (8534/ 9618) 
yeah exactly i know 

Recording: (8535/ 9618) 
well um i i suppose  well i i decided that i was groing to dayt a black guy and my my dad did not like that at all so he disowned me and so now he i am married to my husband and 

Recording: (8536/ 9618) 
but with kids in therre just so much more active at a early age 

Recording: (8537/ 9618) 
umhum do you know a a group called uh midnight oil yeah  they are pretty good i like them yeah 

Recording: (8538/ 9618) 
um sector and i think that is a good signe but i think there is a huge there is millions of children that do not have any health care and that is not right there is like there is a lot of like between the lower and the upper there is a huge disparity but at least it is a step in the rght directon and we have a a nice saled middle incme middle inn middle income base i think because a lot of countries only have the tlike i visited mexico and seems like they only have the distinction between the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small and that i bt that ofconomy is coming along too and i mean it it t will be it is developping itself which is which is nice i took a tour of a a plant down there because my my d my old man had business down there so i went down just to see it and like it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivlant of like seven bucks a day but they getis they get bosten to work because none of them have cars nd then on top of that they all get a meal because they theyke like a hot meal like theyhave a cafterio there because i was talking to the the one of the managers and he said if we do not do that then tey will not be thinking about our quality and they will be thinking about getting foodandthey will be hungry so it it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and i 

Recording: (8539/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8540/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8541/ 9618) 
um well like i said before i think i do not know i think screening would be very difficult i mean especially because at that age you are going ta have a lot of people who are you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said i mean you know they can play off whatever and unless they were you know 

Recording: (8542/ 9618) 
umhum i do not know that they would use the fotionha theyhad i i i do not know 

Recording: (8543/ 9618) 
i mean no crash or anything but was rather scared  kind of shakeng up by it but um no they are very very serious about designated drivers 

Recording: (8544/ 9618) 
well most people think it is something they rely on like well the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools on that issue then yeah i i agree with the gambling thing you know just as long as it is like social drinking  in a sense because if you have people just go out like today i i bought a one dollar lottery ticket d wone two bucks off of it so i kept my one dollar and uh got a one dollar an on yeah there is and the then there is these um a little bit more expensive cards you buy the lottery cards one of them is called battleship that i have won lot of money off of 

Recording: (8545/ 9618) 
did not hear about that 

Recording: (8546/ 9618) 
and work later than which was fine by me or he would cll and eoud saysit okay if work alo late t would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that

Recording: (8554/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8555/ 9618) 
um actually it is more it is almost actually turned into like self business um like i sai itd started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doiand i tell them anybke oh i wil have some things around the house that need to be done and so i would go there thand they would tell people than 

Recording: (8556/ 9618) 
teachers a coupleof teachers decide  take a bunch of every coupleof years they go to a different country

yeah 

Recording: (8559/ 9618) 
i know 

Recording: (8560/ 9618)

Recording: (8571/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8572/ 9618) 
no painting was needed uh well then then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh you know get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and uh uh scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating um and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate 

Recording: (8573/ 9618) 
oh well that is unfortunate 

Recording: (8574/ 9618) 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and elevent they are a little more focused on the fact that they bether get tey are act togethe r because they are going to have to go to college and this is like the only life they are going to get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious kids at middle school think everything is just a big joke you know i am going to play in a rock band ah you know they all think they re gong o be wrock stars and drummers and and you know they could care less about anything it has not hit them yet this t is my real life  doh just my one real life better not throw it away they waste time you know they loose stuff

Recording: (8593/ 9618) 
um probablywould have beenabout six years ago i woade been in six or seventh grade 

Recording: (8594/ 9618) 
i did have a a part time job i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go full time and i just did notfeel like i wanted to go full time so i was working as a receptionist and uh answering the fhone doing some light filing just a variety of task office type task and i really liked it i liked the hours but i did not want to go eight hours compared to four so i left

i think there is a heck lot more to it than what we will probably ever know uh you know they they really have not checked into the background of the parents you knonow to what their boliefs were and everything uh and i think that is a shame because you know you mentioned it before about something axcidentally happening andang where some kids shoots another kid you know and tand the parents are ore responsible for it and everything you know these two kids deliberately went in to kille and they oned to kill more than what they killed uh then they killed themselves so we il never know from theare in point why they did it but i think there is got to be something that we could find out from you knowh u from their parents as to how they live you know they could have been anything you know they could have been down they could have been making them making hem do it you know

Recording: (8719/ 9618) 
about once a week my wife sees her usually more anm 

Recording: (8720/ 9618) 
ight right  that is right yeah so that that was an interesting and when we went to church up hammelton and over to and and  on moris or up new albany road to morison over to high street none of that commercial stuff was out there on moris road i do not know if you know moris road very well but there is uh out out by carol there is shopping center after shopping center after shopping center  after housing development after but when we did this in the mid sixties when we drove up that way in the early sixties there was there were fields there were farms there wre  h there were forests you know none of that stuff out there and it is just it is just amazing the urban sprall that is taken over out there 

Recording: (8721/ 9618) 
umum 

Recording: (8722/ 9618) 
hum 

Recording: (8723/ 9618) 
umhum right there 

Recording: (8724/ 9618) 
you know to get a a four or five dollar a year taxcut 

Recording: (8725/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8726/ 9618) 
a it should bebut there the students that are at the other end need to help too a lot of people think if you have a child that is gifted that all your problems are solved it is not it is a different set of problems there is personality corks to go with out emotional issues 

Recording: (8727/ 9618) 
i will raise them the best way i can 

Recording: (8728/ 9618) 
during the depression my grandfather um moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (8729/ 9618) 
willing to do that again 

Recording: (8730/ 9618) 
right right 

Recording: (8731/ 9618) 
yeah it is like the uh the woman that used to live in the apartment where we live before ust see she had a husband that she was married too for quite some time he got on ohio is number onen dui list with eighteen dis an can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you think your first di effence would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend in jail or something but eighteum and you ar racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (8732/ 9618) 
civil rights um well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an alusion um yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethoninc background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating and equal an fair society um may maybe some many left tis positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based uppon where where in the social stratom you are born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upwardd and that the these class i mean   i do not wan to say classlines because that has so many like historical commutations because it is not the exact same as stay class was in the marksis sense but class lines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is going no buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual 

Recording: (8733/ 9618) 
yeah for everyboddy so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and and with um my husband he is it is he is the oldest so for everybody 

Recording: (8734/ 9618) 
i do not know wher i am going to fly into honestly i am thinking there soud be doing a curreer fli 

Recording: (8735/ 9618) 
so yeah 

Recording: (8736/ 9618) 
or limited very limited 

Recording: (8737/ 9618) 
it is an island but i plan it together i liked it there i kind of like  i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space and i doi and even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the story s do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things in you know good old special effects um but uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know  i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh bilona and tom which i do not like that at all 

Recording: (8738/ 9618) 
better than that much dirt  so uh whenever they we heard any firing like it was coming toward us why we would head for that hole 

Recording: (8739/ 9618) 
a have uh five hour course the first term of sume recorder 

Recording: (8740/ 9618) 
yes yes you might make millions you could retire young  really 

Recording: (8741/ 9618) 
is that right 

Recording: (8742/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8743/ 9618) 
i did not know about 

Recording: (8744/ 9618) 
totally left that part out no one filted me in about no throwing up or anything that that really made me a 

Recording: (8745/ 9618) 
i use to think it is a different time now i do not think uh i think everybody is living more for a day in talking about the future you know hoping that the future is there i think there is uh quote unquote uh entime aspect of life you know 

Recording: (8746/ 9618) 
you know now 

Recording: (8747/ 9618) 
okay good 

Recording: (8748/ 9618) 
like trying to cram organic into my head and 

Recording: (8749/ 9618) 
hat did you spend much of your time doing besides storkeling 

Recording: (8750/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8751/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8752/ 9618) 
but you understand what i am saying it is you are going to have to make make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal 

Recording: (8753/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8754/ 9618) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want some you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about  you know i mean whats to prevent them from going in finding out what some company is doing what research is and that is a that is a threat on the weab too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you can yoea k it is corporate recipiu knoch and i am sure that is going on and i have heard cases of it yea h well and the thing is people are real sharp and kno matter what you do they will find a way o  you know its nobody is found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (8755/ 9618) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (8756/ 9618) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked but i aranged my life around her so that even thog i had that degree i waiht at tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with with her all day then when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with tham 

Recording: (8757/ 9618) 
well they were none of my friends that were pregnant and i am not sure they you know i just remember a couple girls that were pregnant i do not i were not was not friends with them and i am not sure about who their boy friends were or anything like that 

Recording: (8758/ 9618)

Recording: (8760/ 9618) 
my father moved here yes 

Recording: (8761/ 9618) 
um but the t trouble is we do not fit the horse with tha proper carriage loaad and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a team there is no sence of having having five gards and a basketball team if you do not have a sin an can tip it off and rebound 

Recording: (8762/ 9618) 
yeah yeah they do 

Recording: (8763/ 9618) 
ell i tat starts with with allowing uh hether has two mommies 

Recording: (8764/ 9618) 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during lunch time because that is the big meal of the day you go home and eat with your family that is really important 

Recording: (8765/ 9618) 
as just a rule 

Recording: (8766/ 9618) 
here was jhust one guy had u  i do not know how many several heards of sheep need to higere uh i think they were mexicans 

Recording: (8767/ 9618) 
so it is very part time and i am a fulltime student so i was working somewhere else before but it was i needed somewhere on campus 

Recording: (8768/ 9618) 
where she works and this is just os uis brass cancer place so 

Recording: (8769/ 9618) 
you just keep going that is part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going 

Recording: (8770/ 9618) 
eating away 

Recording: (8771/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (8772/ 9618) 
does not have any words in it like exasser bate or undoutedly i il tell you that 

Recording: (8773/ 9618) 
um yeah across the street s of dental and the hospital so people were really loued down there 

Recording: (8774/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8775/ 9618) 
um basically they did not legally adopt him or anything but they are the ones that he considers his family really and i mean he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad but it is always kind of a chalenge 

Recording: (8776/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8777/ 9618) 
why are you doing it now but and then my myt my youngest one she likes to dress totally different she is sort of like uh a little bit of a preppy but she uh does not understand why people want to have like yzawed on their shirt or you know a name on their pants and she says i just think that is stupid she says you can buy nice clothes with out that so she is neither one of them pressured me and uh the one thing that was really od when they were little is we would go like to toysress and up and down the roathe and i see kids that is like you know d  a thin on to and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walk in and it is like you know i told you i say i says you know i feel like i am an oger because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff and she goeys no she says they do not want it she says they just want to see what it is like you know because their favorite tore when they wre little is i would go toh uh what yo call that lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofas and the chairs and take a nife and cut doors in it and they would play with that for weeks you know until somebody or one of their friends would come over and have a little accident and tn we go well we have to build a new house but you know they just reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoyed you know o 

Recording: (8778/ 9618) 
okay 

Recording: (8779/ 9618) 
six 

Recording: (8780/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (8781/ 9618) 
so i was like in shape very well  i was in very good shape 

Recording: (8782/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (8783/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (8784/ 9618) 
o 

Recording: (8785/ 9618) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know

but you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they change heir mind and stuff assto the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but that is not going to happen in this case i do not think and e because of her age and this makes in this sense to me the state law says that she has to have custady the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age andi does not make any sense to me but so that you know they are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not wan to take the baby home because they are afraid of being two attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic um they

yes 

Recording: (8930/ 9618) 
and i do not know whether orandid or not he is never said anything if he has but uh i think my attitude would be uh do not tell and you knoh uh the the guys that g come out very voi vociferously in favor of uh publicizing it and all that i do not see what they expect to gain i mean if they they uh in fact i do not i do not think that they do gain anything by it 

Recording: (8931/ 9618) 
yeah isa new grandma 

Recording: (8932/ 9618) 
i think the one of the things that we when when you are baptised is that youre really supposed to help other people to like if if somebody gives you a guift you want o give it to someone else but it is easy a lot of times just to fall into the you know like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think well what are those weird ose you know they do not wear makeup or whatever wat we w we can wear mak up if we want but so i think for a lot of times people do fall and just sort of but i i was not raised tha moremand so i have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it is so new to me that i am just you know i will talk about it with anybody and and and so iand i am also not affraid of people who are not moremans because i think if you grow up like an member of the church andyou might be a more afraid of people that do not believe like you have been taught uh i think a lot of the you know we do not drink alcohol we do not there is a lot of restrictions i guess you call ten restrictions but theyare i feel like the are more just health coats it just keep you healthy and so um it might be it is like if we if america you know we are used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like you might want to get to know h chinese people but you might not quikte be a little timid about you know same kind of thing but i i am noti do not have any of those bariors

hen you are fifty five or or is it sixty two or whatever age as an age limitation a or you based upon age or disability or being out of town uh you are allowed so routinely we have uh done tnhe out o i mean done the uh absent over the years no going back to basic politicians ii i think we have uh i think the vast majority uh are truly good honest people they try to mean well uiam i am concerned alwayse that uh people who go into politics thare in fine shape when they start but the tremendous influences are brought to bere that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there and they are just overwhelmed it it and i do not necessarily think it is a it is a a dishonestty it is like a title wave they get caught up and they can not resist the direction it is being pu or they are being pushed 

Recording: (8937/ 9618) 
and now it is our turn to deal with the issues we see our parents we see this generation all these things that are still popular it  that we do not look down on the sixty i mean i think the sixtys son like a pretty fun time to live i will get into politics in a second um but those things are popularized but no we can not do it anymore because we havegot all tese problems

Recording: (8967/ 9618) 
there is too much information and too much change uh librarians u this is against probably  wt the image of librarians are they are very very eager to embrace change uh internet came out and you know when d when it got out of the areaf it was being used by universities or whatever for research that is what it was at first librarians were right there nd they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they can do with it uh when pc is a we you know it it was revolutionary whend we announced  ye mean were gongto use ibm pcis are access to this system and we would provide you softwere you cauld do some of the work that you usis doing but with us in your computer and it is like it was incredible they yand we had trouble with the demand it was you know like tripple what we expected librarians were ready for it 

Recording: (8968/ 9618) 
and uh it is great we have been reengineered the last eight years odak downsizing and trying fit the uh uh fit the i guess the attributes the person brings to work as opposed to uh one of the probalms whit have t se as an as an employer or aas a superviser managera a lot of times we have to promote because well the buraucracy says you haveto do this in order to g up there they do not  concideration  the attributes  the person has and so now we are saying okay if you bring this atribute to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you instead of puting o over here in let us say a man juril position which you rel do not have any call for but you are there because of the money only okay so whey are trying to fit the attribute to the person and compensate them accordingly which uhey if i think we did that we would prbly have more teachers 

Recording: (8969/ 9618) 
and why do not people use their time you know and it is free you know rather they get all tenced up and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of their way because they got to get there you know

there is no need to attack students over it and ihave read some article in the lantern i do not know why i read that but um i hate that paper but anyway um i have read some article that the guy said he is not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoied so they will go whined to their parents about how the university does it and then they can all fight the establishment and 

Recording: (8974/ 9618) 
but like if you said i we will have a buss service we will go and pick your guys up you know and then then you can not use the excuse my car broke down or something and then like if you even to give them a like does not even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you are runing three shifts you cauln just you know here is a box of donuts and some milk or something you know and that does not cost the company that much becan

Recording: (8976/ 9618) 
u 

Recording: (8977/ 9618) 
and this tubes and all that i mean i remember seeing that like an eighth grade and lookd at that thinking that is me you know

um i helped them set up different things help them you know clean them up afterwards prep patients all kinds of different things there was a lot of blood and stuff but i do not know when you when it is not you it seems a little  easier to observe iesy when you see somebody you know it is a little more concerning toy i do not know but you see a lot of different stuff and youh hope that the majority of it is helping this person out now my wife you know she works she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that and that is a lot different than where she is now with the cancer because there is so many different factors there you are you knowt she says it is so hard to see somebody thirty years old and they come in and they have us bresst cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell hem these things she says you know two or three times a week you know you your heart just drops out bcause you see that they have their little kids and now you are going to be going for came u there py radias yaud all the stuff you know and it is unbelievable how many it is just hard to believe how many people go through there they are talking fifty sixty patients at ded 

Recording: (8980/ 9618) 
you know and i mean it do not matter to me whether you are black or white matters to me whatvre the way you treat me like when i first got out  services when they really started a thrgn rid of acy i was going to get a job and the trucking industry and they could not hire me because that was when they first come down with a manddate that they could only hire blacks 

Recording: (8981/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (8982/ 9618) 
the risks and what goes into it and like i said i mean it does not really hurt anyone the high part of it

umhum 

Recording: (9025/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (9026/ 9618) 
then you can go visit whath the empires that the big thing like the statue of liberty 

Recording: (9027/ 9618) 
it is yeah because pediatritians are able to dispense it and um i just you know felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible you know growing up 

Recording: (9028/ 9618) 
but when you look at comman he  thinks there was a point where they they asked a yes or no question 

Recording: (9029/ 9618) 
uh this is shery 

Recording: (9030/ 9618) 
i  i am n pressd i am like okay i tried to build a car and it did not look like anything 

Recording: (9031/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (9032/ 9618) 
yeah 

Recording: (9033/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (9034/ 9618) 
yeah i think so i think so and like they just neither of the candidates really seems like they have that much integrity t to me you know so 

Recording: (9035/ 9618) 
it is probably family by family i mean e  that is why i was a little bit late leaving work the way it was theyare they re we have got two coworkers one um haws her child of the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and and listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week u i mean she is dropped off at six am and not picked up till six thirty pem and she is fine with that me personally there is no way because somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you onto that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks andh she is going to go she is she is going to put her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (9036/ 9618) 
so she so i probably di learn a little bit because i i she is still do she is lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which i love to cook 

Recording: (9037/ 9618) 
i think society us toda up today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting buy with stuff you know and theye are more vocal about it as opposed to being byon it but back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks wand thereis bad whte too you know so but not all of them are you know are that way 

Recording: (9038/ 9618) 
um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally number one it is really hard to and secondly it probably will not kill them like a gun can um and you have to use your brain so i did not come from a hunting background um but my husband does work for the state hir patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um in a lot of them they respect them if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people where you do get some of the you know ma cheese mow people that just want to go out and shoot things and yeah yeah i i yeah id not it is not the guns that is the problem it is the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9039/ 9618) 
um so i am sure that ly increases the rate in public schools for 

Recording: (9040/ 9618) 
um i do more summer sports but um he is just beginning on the computer um i am pretty computer literary i have really never had a job yet it is always been working with food or plants 

Recording: (9041/ 9618) 
mhum 

Recording: (9042/ 9618) 
mhum 

Recording: (9043/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (9044/ 9618) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a god get out the vote campaing uh in ouhio i think it is easier todo that because there is a law that i do not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who wa voted hey have tiput up a list of uh registered voters and crosse out those who  voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i would gottan from the pord of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who would shown support or wer it was on tecided on the election and i would cross off tose that hauld voted and then i had a list tof those that had notand i had people waiting at a phone bank and i woul call them at work or at home and and i would offer to take the to the poles if you do not have a rde uh we will take you to the poles if youar worried about you know someone watching your kids we have ser t if fig teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or wewill sit an your home and we wi vad yo sit for you why you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are routed from thour home where their office you know inor reminded to go vote will also vote four what ever issue were candidate has reminded them to do that because what i did was is a very low kee thing i would call people on election day and say hi this sis werbord i am calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will rememberto extercise your mosed importantfreedom which is to go vote and oh by the way oh when you go ta vot we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and if you need ta ried let me know we have got them set up for you and but you know that is very i mean i and and that is not getting people to vote and incourage them to vote because they should that is a a spechial campaing for y paticular issyue were a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is import maybe because we have had it too easy my got my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there was  king and  queen and you know he had no right to vote so  when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to himyou know and a he just pass ed on to you know his daughter my mother my father i do not know how he  it was imortant to him but t was awiys in portand o him ad we talked about politics at the dinner table some times we talked ta bout issues and he said you know wais important to to be hord so i do not know if it was that it got passed on parent wise or what it was 

Recording: (9045/ 9618) 
uh about fifteen minutes my mom and i do not go too far from en so but jacon is gong to take the week off and everything so i think that we will we will be able to do that 

Recording: (9046/ 9618) 
that is not right so i have always gotten two percent raises even though uh basically i have been cross trained or hire yo want to say it i can working three or four areas where most people can not but i have seen people get ten percent raises and i have seen me get two percent raised when i am doing three jobs and they are doing one 

Recording: (9047/ 9618) 
i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i do not know what street it is on 

Recording: (9048/ 9618) 
yeah i think mostly they did uh i was kind of surprised um which class was this in i think this was inthe that iintroduction to th arts class i was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard   and i did not think it was that hard at all but she wrote me some kind of nasty note at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight ay average at this school before my class and i was giving her a be and she was her average was going to be ruineded and she hoped i felt guilty about it  not really  not really i mean i was greating on a pretty much of a curve to i mean i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was that was attempting to do the work at i think i flunked one person that was really gooping off and uh  but in terms of a curve i had as i had beezs i had a few cezs  so yeah aw will 

Recording: (9049/ 9618) 
wolw when you get into the black population you sometimes see some 

Recording: (9050/ 9618) 
whether they re play a video game where they are shooting people i can not say see that as being something that affects them 

Recording: (9051/ 9618) 
 

Recording: (9052/ 9618) 
uh 

Recording: (9053/ 9618)

Recording: (9056/ 9618) 
little girl i i always think you should name a kid n i have opinions about everything see i think you should name a kid something that will fit him at eighty three and eight and in between like we named our son robert so when he was little he was robby now he is eighteen he is rob when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert pal you know and in kindergarten all he hald learned to right was rob or arobb why so that i you know i have a hard time picture in an eighty three year old woman is a tammy 

Recording: (9057/ 9618) 
actually not that diffcult but 

Recording: (9058/ 9618) 
oh the only one on my whole block 

Recording: (9059/ 9618) 
yeah but it is not a good way for me to make money because if you are farming out people or if you are better still drop it down a level if you are exchanging hours for money or time for money then you are havea you findant amount of time and that is 

Recording: (9060/ 9618) 
uh well i think only because i went abroad i had basically one extra quarter beyond four years

then 

Recording: (9064/ 9618) 
eah 

Recording: (9065/ 9618) 
that is how i feel that is that is what i believe  i choose to belive at 

Recording: (9066/ 9618) 
so i you know i i just think the more you are open about things i just think that is the best why it you know when you put things that do not talk about it that is when the problem start 

Recording: (9067/ 9618) 
m 

Recording: (9068/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (9069/ 9618)

Recording: (9184/ 9618) 
and they leave and then you get either another asshol or somebody goodyou just waiti until you get somebody good 

Recording: (9185/ 9618) 
thet the people that are doig you wou think why daore you why are we hiring these guys you know what do they what do they think o 

Recording: (9186/ 9618) 
i blame it on that yeah because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school than you know just recently i guess it was not in the bige numbers at one time but there is been random violentce in schools you know were kidsave died even more thand you know seven or whatever and i think that the media is just made it into something if they have glamorized it and some of the kids i think they are screwed up anyway and they are just like wey you know i can do that and i will be on the yeah i do i think that is a big part of that because they wal not they are name non and they do not care if they diye anyway umhum umhum 

Recording: (9187/ 9618) 
actually they are they are working o tan i am sorry di  menon or uh um they have they have um just in stat et some bones skeems where as the poverty let level i think is considered um theirteen thousand pounds a yeare um and if if you are below the poverty level and you you go back to work you get a certain like ac stor boness beyond you know so there is a bonus for back to work you mention earlly ore about like how this would affect the children with this to your welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system theare for for whatever reason than i do about this istem here whichu kind on fortunat but um there i mean i do not really think and a lot of situations of course i am sure there people who follhey as a shiud be an who who really need it and who really you know tak can care of their children but un fourtcunately you do not really see that si very much you ee the people who like theire kids see none of thatd money you know they are left at home by themselves if h if they can even you know get them to school if they yeven go to school if they are yeven bothere you know and you know those you know a lot of they r tey are  docou muncturies on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your fas than in is here that i ever noticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if if if te kid has bad behavior ore you know bac tendence thet you send them home i mean i think that is the most rediculous thing like surely thatis not up punishmen for a lot of these kids and you know at leased in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing what ever going around the neighborhood shop lifting bleing you know hot wiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and i do no know i think i do have sort ofry strong oppinions about people you know who are having all these kids in or take care of them at all 

Recording: (9188/ 9618)

Recording: (9205/ 9618) 
as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it is yeah i mean when i when you come down to these things there is uh people with mental illness and with the des bility are trying to pawn off the responsibility on to everybody but themselves you know well the medical doctors if they would have seen his guy and given him medication he would not have went out there and killed somebody you know shil would have cout ha man u if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will that was his responsibility to take that medicine everyday just sike it is mine to take mine everyday and when i stopped taking mine that was my responsibility which is why i do not want to go to the legal system to try and maki an excuse even though there is uh there is ah some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or or off the influence of medication um in case they bought a house or signed into some cind of contract that they would not be liable

uh and at least it gave you a lot different view 

Recording: (9220/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (9221/ 9618) 
it it might i mean i good teachers do that i i i still get upset when i was teaching school i wu did activity base teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at doublin schools whasuppos be one of the better schools in the area and i thought ther would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter rite the answers to the questions at the end of the bok and i thought how boring i mean there  different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence from the media uh and i say media broad base and you be at prent media or tv um that has this culture today of um stars and you know media of uh phenomenons and and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is wherk comes from their parents do not vote so if theyir parents do not vote they are not know again i do not know what the the answer is um but it is very scary what is going to happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me as i think about this is that i will not be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too i have great faith in democracy um there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue i think kids would  if if there were kids in college that were being drafted in being sent to dye in a war that people did not think was important or had no real relevante to their lives i mean i think the kids would would rally immediately  the issue right now is that there is nothing there

his mother died um a week after we got married she had diabdise um u juvanil diabdis is diagnosed at the age eleven and just over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and did not make it through the surgery my grandmother also dieduring open hert surgery so my perception of open heart surgery even though i am a nurse  it is not very good just because of the two 

Recording: (9232/ 9618) 
you know i certainly would not and would i expect my mom to stay with with that in that kind of a situation  no way i would want her to be happy and i would want my dad to be happy also so ultimately for that situation i think it was much better um they got married kind of young too you know and i think that i think that maybe just jumping into a situationa you need to be a little bit more careful i know that that now it is a lotdifferent than it used to be people would get married and they would just be expected to stay together and there is a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they are miserable

Recording: (9266/ 9618) 
i was too young 

Recording: (9267/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (9268/ 9618) 
or that are having kids and i mean we talk about that is all we do is sit ing there and talk about our kids and what they are doing and how our parents and then reacted like there is this girl that just got in there today and and her parents are like flipping out because she is pregnant and um we were tllin we were all telling her about how you know um it  it always starts out that way and they will ease up later on 

Recording: (9269/ 9618) 
ah oh yea 

Recording: (9270/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9271/ 9618) 
i know 

Recording: (9272/ 9618) 
at that time in the uh thirtyes 

Recording: (9273/ 9618) 
do you want this doner to be this this and that  some people will some people  some people say that i feel sorry for those people and i pray for those people because praer is the most powerful thing you can have that is going to get you through nothing else i do not care what channt t challenge you haven in front of you you put in his hands and you have enough faith to practice that it will come through it may not come through the way you think it is you want et tog but some where on the line you are going to say h for some reason i wantsu i wam supposed to do this i can not explain it but you are alwaysloking for reasons you are asking me i am looking for reasons that but a lot of times you can not give a reason it just happens why dould you marry your husband why dould you how dould youmeet your husband how doul you come about how would you passing ut togh explain that to your offspring some day 

Recording: (9274/ 9618) 
they help him 

Recording: (9275/ 9618) 
those are a ink fhink you were impling these our needs to those people but they are not uh so howd we correct some of thes you gotto i think we have got to cut out a lot of this luxury we have got to slowly bring quot that family back home uh and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares ind todays were uh weare far less igre culturarlyrelated uh we are for more in servise or indtation and manufacturing ourintation uh so uh a man and u  or what m me re frase a woman can do most of the work is being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as i e cultural people  uh ad is wonce again theugh that would bring people back to this central family make up just has to be communications communications as it is going uh a it is er reversible uh  i think hit can be redirected and much in the manner ses speaking uh and and where des tis start ithink  has start back here and first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to uh it was just common ah you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participant weil participate and or assist uh what today they have these assistants but they are higred directed assistans they are not in their portraing or passing theire o thervalues of the community to the stodnts uh so i think that is i i guess i come i we will continue to come back to family to family almost everything is got tim begomin back the family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis 

Recording: (9276/ 9618) 
because they are they are they are saying you are still a kid but yet 

Recording: (9277/ 9618)

Recording: (9289/ 9618)

so hard i mean every summer they have home work that hase to be done or else the first grading period is notup and when uh my you know oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they hde ta eaching an caddame there and once she got into it she went  may bou knogt  so i said well what you know whatever so then she wanted to go  because it is basically ah collumbus pubbliek school that is year to college only i mean if yif you are not going to college do not go there because you wil folong oult it is very hard and she got in the second year three weeks before school started and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of material that is got to be done in three weeks so i thought well i will just call and ie called d i hve taughte prins soewn i said you know they gave us all thisstoff and you know everybody else his had june july all guess to get this done and she is got three weeks and she goes and the principal goes that is correct and i gowell there is no weigk she can get this done you know i said you know everybody else is had all this time and she is going to gt it done three weeks and they go that is right so they take there is no excueses you know and it is it is very hard i know my youngest daughter who is just as smart as my oldest what do horrible there because you know basically they say uh we are talking about china this week and uh on desember the fifteenth we want to report on why chinese people do what they do you know  it is like aund every week they do not come by and go have you started have youstarted have you started do you have the outline right and it is up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i hae to ve bibiography  i have to have the factso i have to interview some people and if you do not sit doun with ha litl calender and go this we gong get this done this we caine getn this done this you just fail so my oldest daughter is pretty uh detail oriented so after we kind of helped her start you know and say you knw you are you are going ta have to do these things so you get this done i said in basically get it done like two weeks t before it is done so then you can say oh this is not very good and you know amendet or whatever or or helps somebody you know get somebody with typeping a whatever so she is really good and it is it is helped her at school a lot ecause i know they uh she she toured here to a hiostate and there if some people here that come frome case and they go this will be easier then you are high school  so 

Recording: (9296/ 9618) 
i am like i do not remember that 

Recording: (9297/ 9618) 
i know 

Recording: (9298/ 9618) 
ou are liket  no bay is  back they are trying to shoot me  you knowthat is uh it i remember hearing  horrr stories you know about people just dying you know left and right just like you know just dropping because just to get out of uh out o ut of east germany you know thaand they do not play  they il they they they tho they do shoot to kill and just now just te just walk back and forth it is amazing ohnlik umhum 

Recording: (9299/ 9618)

Recording: (9300/ 9618) 
you know we had one of th parties up there and they have this um big like peramid shaped thing i forget what they call it ste co christal something i do not know but they have a speaker hook up to it and the structure of it makes the sound resinate like crazy nd they have subwofer stting underit andthere is his bed in the middle so i ended up falling asleep there one night and somebody woke me up with the music

geet theirs are wonderless right there a she travels all the time 

Recording: (9302/ 9618) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (9303/ 9618) 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (9304/ 9618) 
you can not especially with kids t is just too overwhelming 

Recording: (9305/ 9618) 
really well i just because it is close to japan 

Recording: (9306/ 9618) 
it was more comfortable here than in high school you do not see like the big clicks like the popular abercromby wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together it is a big mix of people and everyone is doing their own thing 

Recording: (9307/ 9618) 
well i am very much in favor of gun control very strong gun control uh i mea i i it they just seem to be too available uh i have donen some of the things that the schools are doing about it you know the kid who comes to scool with a paper gun gets suspended that is a little much but 

Recording: (9308/ 9618) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a downsid and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really dou need it and but you know as long as they have you know created a system whereby you know it will not be obviously is good for those people as it has been the onens ho are genuinely unemployable but you knw i think depending on how um sort of focus they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it is divided up i do no know hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in which ever direction they are most seeted for you know as vola far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean you know there is so much volunteering to be done everywhere and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking ind whatever way you think that you can you know there is something you know hopefull that i do not know 

Recording: (9309/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (9310/ 9618)

Recording: (9354/ 9618)

Recording: (9355/ 9618) 
umhum yeah

Recording: (9358/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (9359/ 9618) 
somebody must have been watching over me 

Recording: (9360/ 9618) 
nayboy see the 

Recording: (9361/ 9618) 
exactly 

Recording: (9362/ 9618) 
there is a lot of uh i do not know how how the training is done with some of these animals you know some of them are treated very cruelly 

Recording: (9363/ 9618) 
i have not seen any fights i have not seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but the only thing that i was really shocked about was the people begging on high street 

Recording: (9364/ 9618) 
yeah weh tit was just the usual things to she touched my things  you know  because they were far aparted enough they had their own social groups they had their own friends and you know so that and interest so it there was not much of that but there was the usual you know she wis breathing on me in the car he saw  mbein too allowed  i do not know if you have got brothers and sisters but yeah you have ro et you went through it all yeah well there were five of us and a lot of that 

Recording: (9365/ 9618) 
but you know what i mean when he was about nine years old but he is known me all my life so you know what i mean it was not a big shock 

Recording: (9366/ 9618) 
hum 

Recording: (9367/ 9618) 
that they fired him like that the night before the michigan game so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fadora you know a hat he lookds so cool you know because jo paternow he always wears a tie i do not know he just he he is a great coaach 

Recording: (9368/ 9618) 
yeah um and  this is something i have thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it is very uh conservative you know not real open to new things or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it would be really competitive i i probably would not be working as a freelancwer today i came to columbus there was not you know there was not much going on when i came here 

Recording: (9369/ 9618) 
oh really 

Recording: (9370/ 9618) 
yeah it is she does not even drive to work you know 

Recording: (9371/ 9618) 
and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines 

Recording: (9372/ 9618) 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 

Recording: (9373/ 9618) 
you know we will go places you know 

Recording: (9374/ 9618) 
i am not that old yet i might look at 

Recording: (9375/ 9618) 
they do not have rabies 

Recording: (9376/ 9618) 
yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to r to find that that columbus is is so out of shape um but i am in the uh well you know in the circles that i move in uh everybody is for middle aged and they all quit smoking nthereal all of a sudden trying to beat off the reaper and um uh so you know i mean i mean well and of course there were always hippies and eaiht sprouts and twigs and leaves anyway you know so th you know that is the cort of circles i move in but i know because i have these part time jobs from time to time i see a a whole different group of people and i ca say it is probably true 

Recording: (9377/ 9618) 
um 

Recording: (9378/ 9618) 
umhum 

Recording: (9379/ 9618) 
just 

Recording: (9380/ 9618) 
so once you convince people that thereis nothing to be scared up hereand thereis nothing to be scared up there i meanand then they start to play and once you start playing you start learning 

Recording: (9381/ 9618)

Recording: (9382/ 9618) 
and and much and much other things you know that i am coming to understand 

Recording: (9383/ 9618)

Recording: (9389/ 9618)

Recording: (9390/ 9618) 
so they i have oiu insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they went an admit me they told me they were going to make me wait two months before they did anything and whan i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital and i crawled out ofnd the car and crawled into the hospital n tol the ither amit me or i would crawl out a the door 

Recording: (9391/ 9618) 
yeah and it is been five years this year that we have been married and uh close to seven that i have known him so and it is still just as exciting it is still just as good and yeu he amazes me every day because i am i am one o all this wil not last forever but you know  and hes lag well when we are ninety you know you will know  so 

Recording: (9392/ 9618) 
so uh he finally decided uh you know after oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his kept his desk in the hallway you know 

Recording: (9393/ 9618) 
why i mean it is part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent thend why do n you wn thut you talk about it and the problem is that they do not they do not know the answer and if they donot know the answer if they can not get a firm this is the answer then they avoid it i trind find i trind fined form me what has become the best answer you know if i do not if i do not b if do no believe something i do not know what to believe about something i will go and i will find an answer for myself i am not going to take somebody elswes answer and if i do take someone else as answer theyw better be able to back it ut you know yeah yeah yeah yeahwell i know a lot of people who do but i know a lot of people who dont umhm umhum um do if theological discussions kno now unless unless you are seaking that out i mean i go to the vinyoard church it is up in it is up in uh um westerville and there is about there is about probably six thousand of us it is one of the biggest churches in ohio and um if you want to find something and that whurch you can find at you can find a discussion group about anything it is just a matter of finding it and withhin any within any de nonmnation or within any religian you go as deep as you wan to go you know there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people who just go on easter there are people who go monday wensday tosay ou kan sonday nights an saturday nights and are very very very into that ann i mean i am not the monday thues day wensday thursday type but i am pretty involved i am pretty involved umhum the community the community um the church is designed as e community of other christians it is not necessarily designed to at um i heard this in a serman this is really good um it is not designed  as the congregation comes in and says way to go pastwer you go do it we are gong to chear you want the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gosple of jeesas christ that is the job of a christian and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what the original you know that i what the that is what a christian is supposed to do and that is what our church does 

Recording: (9394/ 9618) 
wu 

Recording: (9395/ 9618) 
and that is actually a really interesting thing too because especially coming back you know and moving all my stuff out of storage i have just sbeen on this you know i am getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it is you know it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so loaded down especially when i ave spend so much time just living out of a suit case you kow i just really realize i have so much stuff that i do not need because there you know everyone has just sort of like a little closet with clothes you know there is not stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it is like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it is like you know picture frames or something there it might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here oh you know there are five dollars apiece let us buy five you know 

Recording: (9396/ 9618) 
and that is what i am saying in atoning for sins  it is quite a hipocracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zansville where i went and burried my grandparents and went through all my life over the door of the church as a picture of christofer collumbus with a missionary a preest and all his men with his sord drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i asked the preest cold hard question

my thesis s on the sudatan germans those are the germans who lived in checka sylvakia uh before the second world war and uh specifically i am looking at how they perceved their condition switching from being part of the austro hungarian empire uh and the germans being sort of the the majority uh even though they were not the majority but sort of the the uh the master nation within the austro hungarian empire to becoming uh a minority within checka sylvakia 

Recording: (9426/ 9618) 
there is veryfinitely

Recording: (9434/ 9618) 
my mom teaches there so it is free tuition i get a twitch and waiver 

Recording: (9435/ 9618) 
ou know that is a possibility you do not you you are not supposed to carry that much money around and it is as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you because you know the the word has to get out that we do not have that much money  it does not pay yeah 

Recording: (9436/ 9618) 
yaud know always something going on 

Recording: (9437/ 9618) 
personally i think it is too late because they can get things on the internet uh you know there is just so many things so many avenues for them to find violence and pornography and you know things that we you know when i was growin up we jus there was no way i could see any of that stuff i had good parents but i i was in to you know lassy and tom and jere i mean you know these but you know they were not vialent and they made you feel good after you watched them but i just think i do not think it could turn back right now i do not know 

Recording: (9438/ 9618) 
no the life style was you know very easy to fit into and i have always been you know interested in you know sort of liked the whole european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and you know studying english here is at tim i das an and studying english and  ore and england is you know sort of i do not know a more a sort of illitist which i did not realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and i u there were a few classes that really stood out where you know there was sort of you knw youu i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like you know wat what i this american know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peers ing classes i mean not directly theyd never sayanything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of 

Recording: (9439/ 9618) 
right 

Recording: (9440/ 9618) 
so they get more buying power if they go there okay 

Recording: (9441/ 9618)

Recording: (9442/ 9618) 
right right 

Recording: (9443/ 9618)

Recording: (9448/ 9618) 
that is huge 

Recording: (9449/ 9618) 
really 

Recording: (9450/ 9618) 
but i want them to do that to me and i think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching  t thinnes thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they are showing right now i think the world would be a lot of place bu a lot better place and along with the politicians  they stoped saying now what is really best for the general public and said of what we think to make ourselves look great 

Recording: (9451/ 9618) 
there is lots of of uh theater and the third thing would be we got restaurants

Recording: (9454/ 9618) 
i am retired 

Recording: (9455/ 9618) 
yeah i mean it is like it is known but it is in a different way it is like a different type of fame than like t traditional style so it is like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it is more of like ah it is not like an mtv type thing you knoh 

Recording: (9456/ 9618) 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 

Recording: (9457/ 9618) 
tis he is wonderful but yo tack then they were they was the sixties and they were hippies and you know my momis got long jet black hair and theyire we are ind theire armmy outfits and ther whatever you know everybody is got bellbodms and my gad got long hair down to hear and everything said they lived like seventeenth avenue for a while and we lived um like i said on som at until i was about three years old and then they split up for a little bed and got back together and my mom and i lived some place on campus and just a little one room apartment  it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends which was which was which great for me i mean every my dad and i would do fun stuff my mom and i would do fun stuff and t and and inow i never remember it being negative 

Recording: (9458/ 9618) 
um  definitely i mean i have think i went to like kindergarten in ta public school so i do not really know too much about like the kind of cirriculums and things that they had to do but i know i mean as far as going to a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that that i am doing now e stuff i already covered in high school so i already have a basis for it 

Recording: (9459/ 9618) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i i know it is like i men it is the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but u it just seems more apparent just because of how you can like go outside all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (9460/ 9618) 
you know it is like look you always think i could you know look i am doing really well look how wonderful everything is 

Recording: (9461/ 9618) 
i think the news media as hiped it up too much really i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that is tryng to escaped from cuba o unite estates tat is found at escee is immediately returned to cuba welther you agree with it or not that is the accord and that is what that is what castro is that is the premicye is operating on uh you know and the news media they have not really been up thiy have not been real objective about it i mean u you know like there are two fisherman that found him at se you never hear about the other one because that this was on one just breefly i heard on the news because he thinks he should go back to his father but you do not hear about him there is three cousins two of them think he should stay miamy the other one thinks he should go back with his father you do not hear about him i was reading about an news week or some place uh so i think the news media has not been totally objective about this 

Recording: (9462/ 9618) 
uh you know stuff like that it is like it is kind of neat becase you do not have to pay wewill you have to pay for it but like magazines 

Recording: (9463/ 9618) 
but we still need to have property management records tit is very essential and a lot of times when you are taking to engineers they do not realize that part of it uh they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh  activity on that whether it is been uh installed removed relocateed whereveit might be but we need to know th how if has impact up on the design of a particular uh facility voice end data 

Recording: (9464/ 9618) 
yeah i mean like it just it provides an a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 

Recording: (9465/ 9618) 
three years i have hem usually have him six seventh and eighth for those language art subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get fased out like right now i am fasing a get an eighth grader out and into the regular english but he worked really really hard and he is very bright and he is still  terrible speller but he is not lazy and he does his asimmans and as long as you clearly explained to him what heis supposed to do and he is a good writer and usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context you know so we are in the process of fasing him out so that he will not have to he is had help i think since he was in kindergarten that is the other thing that is really in inigma about these kids ninety percent of the time they are icuse like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty and i mean they are very bright but yet something is not 

Recording: (9466/ 9618) 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know its kind of appalling to to the parents and everything i guess maybe that is where i am coming from u mean uh the way some of the uh kids dress you know retro back to and with the bell bottoms and everything to uh and and they uh the persings i just can not get into that you know and some of the girls i mean they you know i mean my guy day at fourteen six fifteen years old ar you looked like they are twenty some years old you know and that is what they wan to look like plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv you know you set there and go i cad my my daughter do not do that you know munches around me kno bu when she is away from me i do not know whath else she does

Recording: (9472/ 9618) 
riht 

Recording: (9473/ 9618)

Recording: (9555/ 9618) 
and you know people do not have big families like they used to you know so

and and the data they collect is just i a whati i mean there are some of those long firms that go ingto a lot of detail but the basic data essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that is it and that is not a i do not think that is a big secret myself but 

Recording: (9566/ 9618)
