i do not know ah like esentiment it is something i basically see it almost as being the same thing is like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yet it is bad for you there is lot of tar arn ing things like that but as far as what it effects it does to you it is no worse than anything alcohol can do to you ah so i mean i do not know i mean i am not sure if they should actually go so far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to control a drug problem wise the things coming in i mean i know i think it is like switzerlind or somewhere like that where they have legalize drugs and they basecy do a government based where the government actually gives them out and the government gets the money for it ah i can almost see that it is being almost a good idea here i mean obviously like said people are gong to do it no matter what i mean to same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on it does not matter what they have to do to it thoh they will come by it ah i mean i mean i coulds see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to a better use of some sorts if they did the same kind of thing

ah i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because your black kid living th ike a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage r whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same thing with like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as bascl you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can not see it being a problem of any sort oh i mean just as long as i have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for him i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (223/ 9620) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation you mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously she said his dad told him about condums you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i say just an inpless with the innernet and everything they they have access to so much information i think that it falls back on the parents still if you areging to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done

Recording: (675/ 9620) 
i just renewed my ccertificate last year so i mak get back int to it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and that is kind of like a tutoring job where you can go can arrange hours with ha student that is at home for some reason a i had one that just had a baby and a they it is an interesting job because they looked for somebody that can cover the most technical i ge subject that thi student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once ind it it was a algebra to another time but they expected us to at least they expected me a to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history so it really requires you to be well rounded and i would like kind of like that a i have taught in a couple of other places a community colleges th college in new work i taught a chemistry class there and h community college which is in hillsborough but i taught it there branch and i taught a introduct an introduction to a collegy class there an introduction to introduction to the arts was called and that was interesting it was at thes er it is kind of an under class of teachers they do not pay you enough to do that they pay you a per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour so

Recording: (683/ 9620) 
yet i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people am bitch and complain all the time but then when you ask hem if they voted they go know it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard am when i was a political action consulting for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics and one of the things i would tell hem is that every vote is important john kennedy wone if you would take all the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per perper precinct one vote per precinct you know if there would just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts you know he would have lost ah and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levey campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven eighteen nineteen votes am if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune abut i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9620) 
o cause right now you know cause he knows how he is he is learned i say he knows more than most kinder gardeners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedul right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational base usually and i lethim play on the computer we will go to different web sights sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening cause he is he listens to everythii

and he said even when he was in high school that they had they had police officers there so that is not like a new thing but he said you would have people like knives and you would have people with fistfights but you would like guns was unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe a ther people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it you know like i do not i was and i did not feel that way but i would like in retrospect i look back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day was like so tromatizing to em like that be like for four years every day you are just like teased or something like horrible and you would like no one talks to you am not justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason

i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put em on and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication cause it makes them different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live in a day in time when there is a pill to help me concentrate they look t like well my my friends have to do it an wi oi ave to do it youknowthey look at it like it is a big paint cause tiy got a run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting ther time released ones there is only a couple of em a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release and they only work for about forty per centof the population most people try the time release and it wears off and it does not do what itspost do so they go back to the six hour dosage you know on the morning one at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and tend late to the lunch line and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess they are in denial just like we would be they say what does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say o ka what are the things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh yes

te crime as it is not is an interesting term all crimes all murders are hate related i am not sure that is it is difficult we had civil writes laws many people were opposed to those but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism a and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime are you noare you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murderd some one else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is already a law on the books i do not think we need to have i hate crime over and above that theethe people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it ii think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rightes an the affirmative action programmes and the bussing did to people is going to turn people against a t gaze like that turnd people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference ii had a i have a black friend at the ohio education association was very active in the sixties in opening up restaurants in the south and marching and y goin to opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things are not better ah now that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that was not my goal my goal was not to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behaviour and the behaviour changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all rihte jury convict white men of oof killing a black man we are in hearts and minds now

a actually i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was all over the papers and you know i think i mean i i do not know what it was like really here i can imagine but i mean there especially they really focused on ah not columbine but the one with the the younger kause in arkansas was it the year before i was there for both of those but you know in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combact gear holding the gun everywhere and columbine you know every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and you know ther facts we are all overthe place but that is another kind of issue but ah what i think caused it i mean i do not know i think that like more should have been made of the fact of you know this like terrible sort of resentment for the o thers tudents and and you know i am not in any way defending they goys who did it but ah you know something is wrong not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point were they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you know that you would even think of doing something like that a i do not know especially with you know everything that was said about the families and you know they did not seem to of course you never really know but they did not seem to have grown up in this you know terrible environment and you know have that sort of you know preconditioned or anything like that ah younow i think a lot more effort needs to be made you know to a sort of you know placate those sort of situations and i mean who does it is sort of another question because you know the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and you know all those kind of things but i do not know

i think people are still fairly raceso i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other race relation is fault um i mean as far as like feelik the black communities things like that you have like b e t u yet iv liked the united negro college fund things like that where they are almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in a way that is almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity the people that need em um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or whult not m and i think it is sort of going along the same lines whre there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else

but it is not going to work i mean they if you are around people i mean number one there around their parents an their siblings and that socialization you go to church or to the library or wherever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get to have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i have read and seen that to they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their peer is opinions because for one example the poky mond craze my son did not know what pokymon was until he heard some other kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like always cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean you know it i mean ecause it is like th they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about i o he must be col cos some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it was ucl so that was my influen art influence on him rather than the peer is influence on him

do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only thing that is going to happen is it is going to truckle down and you are ging to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miserable and they fight and then you feel like it is yer you know people say it is my fault because thits happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a tea nager and having my parents split up i think that would be probably very difficult am so i do not know that is a totaly different prospective to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger

it might ahit might i was gong to say earlier and and i forgot to mention it as that one of the best campaigns i have seen in recent years utilizing college ade students has been clinton is campaign both times he knew he needed to get a base to increase ah his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign and nd i believe that was ninety two did a really superjob of organizing college students caus that is when you are at your most am when you believe in things and you are at your most idealistic and you would think that yo kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that a in addition to that and is an under current it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talk to people and you have to be careful where you do this cause abortion is an avery divice of issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divides them you definitively almost like an viat nom almost like that wore divided people ahbut i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting rovers as weighed and not and inprotecting choice you ni am and i am starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an op portunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and d that if you want to protect that right youve got to vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way buboth in ninety two and again in for your ninety six and i think that is going to happen again because the candidates and i am telling you my politics here very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice ah and am i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidate a over candidate b because they will protect abortion rights that is going to divide the country and not keep us together

if you did not own let usay on a school leving you din you pay taxes i always because i rent and i always get very upset i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yes i do cause every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is built in to the rent at least it it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord y and io i have never lived any place where my rent did not go up after a school levey passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond o of what the levee was hso that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know cause a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because they do not have kids in the schools uno but education is the foundation of a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry h youre democracy could go down the drain ah that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or yo know a the university of virginia and believed in education because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues but it is very difficult to day to get to people a i have talked to some aalmost college age students and they do not see the relationship you can talk logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them and you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why

te miste i have a very general opposition to this kind of thing no matter where it is any more my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the total destruction of our centr cities a and i say when i speak of centra cities i do not necessarily mean just cities the size of columbus wic which is the largest one in the state of ohio now but i am talking places like washington court house which maybe have fifteen thousand or a wadsworth which may be have eighteen thousand this kinds a thing is being developed on the periferal of the cities is just totally destroying those and of consequence i feel it is breaking our society down to the point where we do not do not know our neighbors at all any more it is quite common any more that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them ah tat all applies to the polarus question as i see it and i think also that it is it is a very very major financial a gain for the developers who are doing it and it is going to therefore harm o the many many areas it is affected such as north north north north north what is the name of the shop north wat northland yell northland i can not say

well i do not think they should be responsibut i think am kids go to school and they need real models good teachers am and i think schools have got a lot better about that it seem like in the late eighties aarly nineties you know the schools lot of em ware really bad am i think finally the education department or whatevers realizing that parents need help whath their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school an you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot am and i think now through education because it is hard all these schools and so many real wearers and everything try to get good teachers and then you know it is always has to do with money an the am not making enough money which the teachers do not make enough money and they are overworked and all these big large class rooms it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a click together you know it would be hard for them to intervene and say al what is going on in your life whics what is the problem you know that is that is not really should be their roll but im if they care enough they should call their parents and say look worred about your son he misses lots school or he is starting to dress really you know sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if hey do not wat to be in sports that is fine theres so many different things at they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and you know but im un fortunae lt i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can not do but in some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home you know i mean

anit is like i like how ske i thought about going to antioch but it was t was really expensive and like um ukno but just because it in schools more of a non traditional a type where they give you like valuations and you do not get grades like and so so then i that is what that is what i heurds like in anntioc where the professor writes alike a couple page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that really shows that that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved in noticing what you are doing as opposed to just like some kid in his class you know

am nad to sond like a broken record but i really think it is ar a backslide on on family units i think it is too easy to sday and i have been married an divorced so i have unfortunately have that experience to me am that it is too easy to get divorced a people do not really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i do not want to say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important am because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want to smack hi and he is being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and letn behold o an hour later week later whatav whatever long it takes i am in love with him again i mean really you know whati am sayng and am i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying into marriage for the sake of the children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring im up in a more stable environment a unfortunately i think that is the problem parents a er a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you n usin the kid is a medium a am or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did not i do not wat to say selfish but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog take some time out of yours your your schedul an am not spend enough time with the kids you know they are workin weten onit and it takes a lot of effort to race kids these days and actually listen to em and get to know them and let them grow in things like that ah and i do not think enough families are doing that

i think more what they need to do is in strict er oh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shooting amd things like that ah because i mean for the most part i mean people relly do not get too badly punished for things i mean i feelike in other countries i mean like people like the age and countries places like that i mean taave really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism yourself serving jail time and get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean in some cases thatl leave i chain you up in beatyo in public for it ah and i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it i mi think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they can get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone yoyoue not even get thirty days in jail and here can be let go i mean it is an awfully small price to pay for

you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know w w they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like we had like the administrators that actually allowed us to have aa day where everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic like en the practice football field and that was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go to class you knw you spent the second half of the day just hanging out and so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts thef the the administrators in the sense that they are there to profide en etieducation so it would be rough and like my high school theythey put up cameras and they had like they locked bathrooms like at certain times you could not go in om it was gettin and they had like we reon the front page ofthe acrambecan journal because they had a lock down where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought the dogs through and they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs

if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but a nin election time a week end is a couple of centuries a year is an eon you kno so anything hitd happened between now and then but i think a dull had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderateand will go with the moderate candidate h which is basically were clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in ah most real democrats the warn badies of the world and many yo congressmen an and senators dislike clinton because they did not think he was democratic enough ah i liked clinton because as i said over the years i have learned that extremes in either party do not get elected and that if you want some one that has your general interest at heart you have to find some one who is a moderane and can can appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went into tell him how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty per cent of the people who were were for you the yes votes thirty per cent who were automatically against you the no votes and thirty per cent in between i told them ignore the now votes no just just do not get hem upset with you you do not want em you know working actively against you lock up your youre thirty that are with you make sure you know you would do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had to misage them and that is what clinton did so well and that is what dull could have done i am not sure if george bw is going to be able to ah because to get the nomination eventually he is gong to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i am anti abortion i am pro gun he is aready said the pro gun and that is isgoing against what most americans are saying dull i think represented where most americans are if youle look at apinion poles ah so you know you have to find a way toto moderate that stants ah whether yo are republican or democrat

iyou know i think to i apologize to my oldest daughter amost every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i was not a child but it is like you do not have realistic expectations of what what children are capable over what they can do because if they are really verbal ama kids always have been really verbal because i have talked to them from the moment they were born even what you know when they could not talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole time i would sly yo coulnd see i do not shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really rerbal and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we gout a hampster ow i simple you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she had not given in ben givin im food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you do not they do not get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bed room furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else while within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year n to have she only had a adrss on the floor in her room because but i mean all that was bazaar now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things ori would take more responsibility rather than especting them to have it and secondly

lassy i think i could summarize ajust with a few word to what you are meaning to say may be wrong but i think you are really meaning to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and they must recognize their children and do like you have just discussed do with them and because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we a fifty per cent of everyone who marries as divorce within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics to day and unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that may be this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reversed probably a once again we are talking about communications too and the communications can be ill an they cang be great as she is touched upon but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from the non family were headed to it or have been headed to r and get back to a very basic family ornientation it it is abhorrent when i hear that te a well was it seven ladies who are quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell there a sperm f not their sperm whatever that is they sell a for ten thousand dollars apiece and bein flanted another so that itsta can produce a quote beautiful child well i beautiful child an if you are talking about just a physical features it is meaningless it is what is imbodied in that body that is can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is abhorrent such a such an ideain that indeed is going to take a way from family i in my way of tthinking i can not imagine that i would ahave my wife producing somebody else is child rand i am going to have the same thank you that is exact fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toard were with that child

heard about that but the same principle applies but i am taught by just everyday thing so that te people whenweve gong t talk of top children primarily a there is no penally any more a parents are scared to death to pick up one up and spank them im with their bare hands or to make em stand in a corner because they considerd iam going back to the word harasmic child abuse and harassme of consequence a and am penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at janie and sen janie you should not do that

you know technically there is insanity and there isn insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is an insane and a just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but a to make them work that off and a face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt unoe so i have got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and other side is if we keep a i believe in the a a reincarnation en law cause an effect and if a person murders somebody they need though they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their a their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of em do not they say that hardend criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to

right t hesame way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because if two people had to work outside the house they get home thei are agrabade their up set somebody else tht had their kids all day and it is it is is terrible that the situation is got that way but i do plead that the older people including our government people and everybody at he the top has to set the example and stick with it

as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized to another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are as because the world in essence is getting smaller because a communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country any more or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (6073/ 9620) 
oh 

Recording: (6074/ 9620) 
that was up the age eighteen to or thereabouts i think that the you sad to get back to the very beginning of the birth an up to kennigard and so forth that is that is the family i think that we in our educational programme we really need to start teaching arwhat i call the older values but ut bu good values i do not can whether there old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that efstablish within our educational system a starting in the elementarang right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college courses that to devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and a assist in teaching but i think that th many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values i could even so go so far as to say in chemistry or botany or psychology any one of those those are specialized subject and and but i think there are elements that thay can have within each one of those talking about family value famly value and tat will help then permeate the entire society but i is got to start back here in that first and i think 

Recording: (6075/ 9620) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a burocracy

we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress progression that needs to be made ah i was just talking to soe one a coupleo weeks ago who is a fellow history major and her actually her brother is ae fello a fellow history major too and a friend of mine i do not know hem all that well but parently her family i mean she is she is double majorn history ind chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports her in this but they have made it painfully clear that when hatshe should not plan on having a career because she is going to have to raise children at some point which is that is not the way things should work in my belief an and the fact that it is like the males telling the daughter this is how things need to be i think i mean i think an inidual individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i am concerned about a a a like this push to the right that is sort of going on hoping it is sort of dying out i mean it seemed a little scary er back in ninety four ninety five bat a i think twe have reached a point where because not all of the advances have been one hundred per cent successful tthe opposition is criticising the advance

oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids lot of kids are on medication to day that should not be but a i think that is the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when weve refer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not just give this kid a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever so we refer em to those doctors and then if this those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put em on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the week ends and it is just to help em focus and then these doctors also asked for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any appreciable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid often you try something else and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can not believe it is the same kid other kids dod not face em they mis well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headaches from dexodrine and ad or all so i say you know if it works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but ow a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because there may be just not able to pay attention a little bit but there not really a d d and the parents are taking em in and going johny is not getting straight ays put yom on something so i guess

Recording: (6382/ 9620) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future ah going all the way back a finances wer were not a consideration n it o i say probably mi first thirty may be forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right ihe swayed them with a position that he had developed ow that is not necessarily his opinion so i am tryn to make a point the but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from a various people within his community whether whether you are talking about a township or county state whatever it may be and yes then pslowly then i think the finances came in the play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of to day and i will leave out this the last two years it because it is cause it is rather sspecific right now but going back the two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on ea national level but i amsing even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there ah i come on well go to dinner we will go to this and we will do this and do this just just barely barely breaking athe barrier but not breaking the law h soyes very definitely progressively has changed

if they hold you know enough of my views i am not going to vote for a woman just because they are a woman an i am not goin to vote for a democrat just gcause they are a democrat theyd better have it you know at least and and i do not need a hundred per cent a agreement with my views but i li to beat in the ninety to ninety five per cent range but a i do not tend to vote straight party line either as i said i have i have moderated from when i was in college to to day part of the the aging process and also partly because i have i have noticed that to get things done you have to have a centr and it is the center that tends to rule when i was in college am we had a bumper sticker that taid america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in date an came out with one that said america love it or leave it and to day i realize that both of those positions are wrong it is america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you do not let them you know have bad manners at the table and you do not let them run around with the wrond yow kids and you want them to behave well yof that is how i see america now and and america has become more centrist and when it deviates from that either way that is when people become upset am si yusthing is important i i remember when who was the other president that i voted for that wone carter black leaders would meet with him oncs a week and then they would come out and hold this press conference and complain about he did not do this for blacks and he did not do tha nough for blacks en did not do this and he did not do that and i used to say somi to some of my black friends tdo not you see what you are doing do not you see the greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said ou know they would be great and an ideal world this is not an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not i what you are going to do is you are goig to make it look like he is so bad and all the issues you are goig to give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up that is just gong to be added to everything else what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him his come out in praise him and that he is doing a good job and that we are moving along steadily and you know i do not think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means ah i made that mistake when i was president of the date and education association we were trying to get a levey past so we weng around as teachers showing all the bad conditions in the school all the leaking we know a seelings all o the pealing floors all the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind of tuff nd it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we are not going to support thos and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite tract we went in and we said a eighteen months later won the boared put another am ba levy on the the ballot we said these are great sgchool we have great teachers look at this kid he is learning to read he is made six months improvement in three months and all that kind it was image and we were saying the same thing you know we wang to continue this we wong to make even this better a we learned to say the negatives in a positive way and that is important and you need to get that is that you need to appeal to the center americans do not like extreme liberals they do not like extreme conservatives they want they want peace

adoption is different i think though that when adoption is entirely different than when you conceive somebody else is spirm or somebody else is whatever a because adoption means that i can not have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here gin you are reaching out to your friend your neighbor you are not just forgetting about i and let the wellfare someb take care of im and let him go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is andand you are really accepting this responsibuilityn that is lup and when you are trying and willing to have well some people wuld probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside on me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already aware to a certain extent of what jeans they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not later on you will find out but istill you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are goin to be able to trace these jeans back and say you kno later on if something happens to this child you are having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and can find itt and help the child better

when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found the jeffersons offensive in many ways cause it was sterea typical and made fun ofof black people an many ways in retrospect it was tren setting and what it did not and even in putting blacks in ah advertisements on t v young kids saw them and saw those adds and saw those t v programmes and so it became a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it bebecomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those t v programmes and think they were tren setting instead of stereal typical ah bi am sure it does have a some influence cause i think it did it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepard helped also

highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different clicks but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that that you know it had to have been more than just you know a sort of normal joc is verses whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to a private catholic high schools but even there you know there was you know a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should deftfrently not i have been going on and that was only on a very small iver they were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like sevweral hundred students that this happened at so

i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over says a that is oka if that other person does it to you i mean thmy mother is to say for every lawl that was written there is another law written over here that will actually nullify that one and asked to ask i have grown older i found at and it isit is worse than to day is world as i sai has the silver rights moveit and you have a right to this and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers can get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is a most thing that ever was passed i do not think there should be any plea bargains an inthe piece o wo mould there are people who ged murdered an innocent electric chair lectric chair i still believe in it because if someone is prove and i do not believe that they should have ten years of a what do they call that legal process where they can theputting appeals thank you that is it i do not think that he should have that either one of peal or two should be the limit if there still found guilty sorry and if an innocent person has not been able to prove he is innocent that is just one of those freaky things that happens because some times innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that is guilty that is corrupt enough at his mind that he kwas how to get away with it and get somebod else take his blame but i do not think there is that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have nullified that because what right does that person have to live tevy just about two or three days ago and here is this guy down the south then and as he is walked out handcuffe behind him and to putn him to cruizer wa bi did two exactly what i sait is go to dois go suswhatch her draw her last breath he killed her now he is got to go and prive meyd be a plea bargain and he will get off with it because maybe he wad abused as a child n it had someting do wit the w his thinking what happened to this woman because of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that

i mean the money you know the money is great you know find it is the biggest rays they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as far as cause the signing boness was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that yous start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to maint campas you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and then they did the rays and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on maink campas and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are definitely a separate budget and you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems an this and that and they are thirty five million in the whole cause theyve bougtow as you east and all this but you know it is not the union is fault that they ran out the contract you know you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wageis so low that it is hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten and the nation or whatever is furnishing but they are not willng to pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always going to have to have people here tocause contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up to day and a lot of times we have a job finished before they have written up the work order

like i am a philosophy minor so like if you look like different ethical theories and stuff like yo like there is a hierarchy kind of this is what i have found there is a hierarchy of things that are ah like the inalienable rights for instance like i can not if you come into my house and rob me and then run outside i knock in it i do not like to kill you for stealing my property like there is a hierarchy there ah for stealing another life that is why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is nothing like if i if it is inalienable the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suicide and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other its so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is inalienable because i di not give it to you i can not take it back you never forfeited that you never gave me that right so that is what i feel like i could never want that in to kill another person

and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign h in ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i d not think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of a registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i used to do as i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or wht was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that had not and i had people waiting at a phone bank and i would call em at work or at home and and i would offer to take em to the poles if you do not have a ride ah we will take you to the poles if you are worried about know some one watching your kids we have certify teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babbys sit for you while you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office you on knare reminded to go vote well also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that cause what i did was is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is reberta i am calling to remind you that to day is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levey and if you need a ride let me know we have got em set up for you and but you know that is very i mean and that is not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should that is a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i o not kno why they do not think it is importan mabbe because we have had it too easy my got my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mea there was a king amd queen and he had no right to vote so t when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him andhe just passe it on to ou know his daughter my mother my father do not know how he it was important to him but was always important to him we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes we talked about issues and he said you know it is important to to be heard so i o not know if it was hat it got passed on parent wise or what it was

i blame it on that yaw because you know there is been a lot more kids that have died in school then you know just recently i guess it was not in the bige numbers at one time but there is been random violence in schools you know where kids have died even more thand you know seven or whatever and i think that the medy has just made it into something if they have glamorized it and some of the kids i think they are screwed up anyway and theire dislike will hay you know i can do that and i will be on the tya i do i think that is the big part of that cause they want their name known and they do not care if they die anyway

actually there they are working on it i am sorry do notmean toontruptia a they have they have am just in stated some bona schemes were as the poverty let level i think itis considered them thirteen thousand pounds a year a and if if you are below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonous beyond yo so there is a bonus for back to work you mention earlier about like how this would affect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system theyare for for whatever reason than i do about the sitem here which ju kind of unfortunate but a there i mean i do not really think in a lot of situations of course i am sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really you knw takin care of their children but unfortunately you do not really see that side very much you see the people who like theyr kids see none of that money you know theyre left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if they are even bothered you know and you know those you know lt they are they are document trees on all the time there so you really sort of it is more in your fhace than in is here that i ever noticed am but i do think and and with that they have specific programms for the children and a i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if if a kit has bad behaviour or you know bad attendants that you send them home i mean i think that is the most ridiculous thing like surely that is not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighbourhood shop lifting boing you know hot wiring cars at the age of yo now ten or something and i do not know i think i do have sort of very strong opinions about people you know who having all these kids and do not take care of them at all

those are as i think you were implying those are needs to those people but they are not a so howd we correct some of this we have got to i think we have got to cut out a lot of this luxury we have got to slowly bring quote the family back home a and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man tho cares in to day is work a were far less agriculturally related a we are form wore in serveice oriendtation and manufacturing orientation so a man and a man o woman ma fre phrase a woman can do most of the work at is being done outside of the home to day versis what they could have done as agricultural people aand once again though that would bring people back to this central family make up just has to be communications communications as it is going it is irreversable ai think it can be re directed an much in the manner sheis speaking a and where des this start i think it hav start back here and first grade tiy think parents must participate with teachers as we used to was just commona you could walk in and sit down and watch the students or participant participate and or assist what to day they have these assistants but they are hired directed assistants they are not in theire portraying or passing there on the values of the community to the students so i think that is i guess i comwe will continue to come back to family to family almost everything i is got to be come back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis

my answer to your question is has this he road ted i am gen answer with the wore yuse eng the word respect a yes i feell that a this hays he rot it over time there is not the respect for or elders i do not necessarily man elders in turms of the crandlod eca age but i am talking in terms e generations th there is less respect for the father less respect for the me ther less respect for the grandparents an the great grandparents a iman give you a first han example i just had to a conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty ashe will come over tomy house grandpa is house and shel come in and sho of flop down in a chare and she will do nothing in that house hold even if you suggest it i do not ever tell her a to to do things and i have pointed out to or thaf whenever we went of visit grandpa or great grandfather a if the if we saw weeds out on the garden we wn outand we to to garden if we if thog the chicken house need to be cleaned a and they had not gotn two t that day we wn i am clean to chicken house we would say grandpal is it ol cave we g a am clean yeu chickeng hous wef corse yen ne very well it was gong to be ok but a matter of respect thoh you ask as it o ket force to do it and a now with her i can have dishes out there in the sant cae that e to eft there for from breatfas an may be the lunchion she he will walk out thare ao say wll grandpa how come in dishes are not done annshe trn von walks away that is right h and and she may than go ahead an say when i will some tims tul ass somtimes should e but let us assume she did she ask its it ll right if i have some of this she goes ahead an gets te dishes out n so for she puts runin in that is sant go with those other dishes makes no efforts to clean em and i i have seen this in many many many inswan as but i wiving you this is very first hand i know this and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society to day so yes an mi opinion defintnthy its he road g iknow you took a litt to ren approatian answering the question a am over the time that this kind of thing is e rotin based upon the word respect she just used the word penalty a penalty hase lots of different definitions each individual has s a metal pict ure what the word penalty means based upon their own experiences i want to take just an i say penalty in a very general sort of way whatever your extreme is to the rght or to the left let us come back to bout the middle i am concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely a i feel it is absolutly esential that we hav penalties we have for everyone for everyone wely across the board we we are getting away from penaly were gettin away from penalts a ba so many people at ddist i give an example talking bout it dalts i just read te statistic of the day ray here cocity columbus where t was an extrememy high pers tant i can not quote the percentages o people who a inore he yellow lights and in of conse gunce they are inting am going through red lights and there are many many many actsidens taking place a iand we it used to be that you could place an law enforcement officwer at the corner en t happen he me y would penalize you by giving your ticket and you face they cort as of case maybe well now we have pass so many little ordenente es and laws and chans they inforcement policies in this cinds o thing with a poor police officer hecan not even do that any onger he is got it is somebody it runs to red light you almost have to hit somebody an then be ecuse for going throh the redlight he can not just arbitrarily be there because that is called a i think the word harassment playse a par you are harassing at en to ad youl be ca yu werstanding or waiting for him to commit this problem when i let us just gev what away from that example you can talk about whether you det you were carrying a i want to get into the guns an knives an stuff in a school at enoug

why i mean it is part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent thand why do not you nonted to talk about it and the problem is that they do not they do notknow the answer and if they do not know the answer if they can not give a firm this is the answer than they avoid it soesomei try and find i try and find for me what has become the best answer you know if i do not if i do not if i do not believe something i do not know what to believe about something i will go and i will find an answer for myself i am not going to take somebody else is answer and if i do take some one else is answer they would better be able to back it up you know h you goy ye ye someeat is telooi know a lot of people who do but i know a lot of people who do not ateopletis someati am do that theological discussions no no unless unless you are seeking that out i mean i go to the vineyard church it is up and it is up in a i am westerville an there is about there is about probly six thousand of us it is one of the biggest churches in ohio and um if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything it is just a matter of finding it and within any within any denomination or in any religion you go as deep as you want to go you know there are people who just go on sunday mornings there are people just go on easter there are people who go monday wednesday tuesday un sunday nights and saturday nights and oure very very very into that i mean i am not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type but i am pretty involve i am pretty involved somsselotswa yyethe community the community i am the church is designed as a community of other christians it is not necessarily designed as im i heard this in a sermon this is really good im it is not designed as the congregation comes in and says way to go pastor you go do it we are gong to cheer you on the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ that is the job of a christian and there are lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what the original that is what the that is what a christians supposed to do and that is what our church does

Recording: (9398/ 9620) 
and that is what i am saying atoning for sins it quite a hypocrisy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zansville where i went and buried my grandparents and went through all my life over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sword drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i ask the priest a cold hartd question
