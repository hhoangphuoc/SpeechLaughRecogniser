i dont know ah like esentiment its something i basically see it almost as being the same thing is like cigarettes or whatever where i mean yet its bad for you theres lot of tar arn ing things like that but as far as what it effects it does to you its no worse than anything alcohol can do to you ah so i mean i dont know i mean im not sure if they should actually go so far as to legalize it but i dont think its really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to control a drug problem wise the things coming in i mean i know i think its like switzerlind or somewhere like that where theyve legalize drugs and they basecy do a government based where the government actually gives them out and the government gets the money for it ah i can almost see that it is being almost a good idea here i man obviously like said people are gong to do it no matter what i mean to same thing with guns if they want it theyll get their hands on it doesnt matter what they have to do to it thoh theyll come by it ah i mean i mean i coulds see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to a better use of some sorts if they did the same kind of thing

Recording: (223/ 9618) 
i personally agree with that but thats just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i dont know i dont think that theres one solution thatll fit every every child in every situation you mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously she said his dad told him about condums you know so theyre going to make that decision on their own i say just an inpless with the innernet and everything they they have access to so much information i think that it falls back on the parents still if youreging to be a parent you need to be responsible and i dont think that its getting done

i just renewed my ccertificate last year so i mak get back int to it part of the reason i renewed my certificate was i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year and thats kind of like a tutoring job where you can go can arrange hours with ha student that is at home for some reason a i had one that just had a baby and a they its an interesting job because they looked for somebody that can cover the most technical i ge subject that thi student is taking in my case it turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once ind it it was a algebra to another time but they expected us to at least they expected me a to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was history so it really requires you to be well rounded and id like kind of like that a ive taught in a couple of other places a community colleges th college in new work i taught a chemistry class there and h community college which is in hillsborough but i taught it there branch and i taught a introduct an introduction to a collegy class there an introduction to introduction to the arts was called and that was interesting it was at thes er its kind of an under class of teachers they dont pay you enough to do that they pay you a per student contact hour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like twenty one or twenty two dollars an hour so

yet i really dont know i dont understand why they dont because to me its the most important freedom we have and people am bitch and complain all the time but then when you ask hem if they voted they go know it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you dont because your voice wasnt heard am when i was a political action consulting for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics and one of the things i would tell hem is that every vote is important john kennedy wone if you would take all the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation by one vote per perper precinct one vote per precinct you know if thered just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts you know he would have lost ah and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levey campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven eighteen nineteen votes am if i knew the magic reason why people dont vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune abut i dont know what it is

te crime as it isnt is an interesting term all crimes all murders are hate related im not sure thats its difficult we had civil writes laws many people were opposed to those but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism a and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate but a crime is a crime are you noare you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murderd some one else one life term i mean murder is murder and theres already a law on the books i dont think we need to have i hate crime over and above that theethe people who murdered matthew shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and shouldnt have anything else added into it ii think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rightes an the affirmative action programmes and the bussing did to people is going to turn people against a t gaze like that turnd people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference ii had a ive a black friend at the ohio education association was very active in the sixties in opening up restaurants in the south and marching and y goin to opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you disappointed that things arent better ah now that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that wasnt my goal my goal wasnt to change hearts and minds my goal was to change behaviour and the behaviour changed except now i never thought i would live to see an all rihte jury convict white men of oof killing a black man were in hearts and minds now

dont agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only thing thats going to happen is its going to truckle down and youre ging to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think its much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family thats miserable and they fight and then you feel like its yer you know people say its my fault because thits happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i cant imagine being a tea nager and having my parents split up i think that would be probably very difficult am so i dont know thats a totaly different prospective to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger

it might ahit might i was gong to say earlier and and i forgot to mention it as that one of the best campaigns i have seen in recent years utilizing college ade students has been clintons campaign both times he knew he needed to get a base to increase ah his chances of winning the election and did especially in the first campaign and nd i believe that was ninety two did a really superjob of organizing college students caus thats when youre at your most am when you believe in things and youre at your most idealistic and you would think that yo kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that a in addition to that and is an under current it wasnt overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talk to people and you have to be careful where you do this cause abortion is an avery divice of issue in this country and i think it does mobilize people but it also divides them you definitively almost like an viat nom almost like that wore divided people ahbut i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it was the difference between protecting rovers as weighed and not and inprotecting choice you ni am and im starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there ive seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an op portunity to appoint two to three supreme court justices and d that if you want to protect that right youve got to vote with the candidate whos going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way buboth in ninety two and again in for your ninety six and i think thats going to happen again because the candidates and im telling you my politics here very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already i know which one will protect the right for choice ah and am i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i dont think its an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidate a over candidate b because theyll protect abortion rights thats going to divide the country and not keep us together

te miste i have a very general opposition to this kind of thing no matter where it is any more my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing because i see the total destruction of our centr cities a and i say when i speak of centra cities i dont necessarily mean just cities the size of columbus wic which is the largest one in the state of ohio now but im talking places like washington court house which maybe have fifteen thousand or a wadsworth which may be have eighteen thousand this kinds a things being developed on the periferal of the cities is just totally destroying those and of consequence i feel its breaking our society down to the point where we dont dont know our neighbors at all any more its quite common any more that if you go three houses down you have no idea who those folks are how they feel what they might do for you or you can do for them ah tat all applies to the polarus question as i see it and i think also that its its a very very major financial a gain for the developers who are doing it and its going to therefore harm o the many many areas its affected such as north north north north north whats the name of the shop north wat northland yell northland i cant say

Recording: (3179/ 9618) 
well i dont think they should be responsibut i think am kids go to school and they need real models good teachers am and i think schools have got a lot better about that it seem like in the late eighties aarly nineties you know the schools lot of em ware really bad am i think finally the education department or whatevers realizing that parents need help whath their kids they cant do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school an you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that youve learned a lot am and i think now through education because its hard all these schools and so many real wearers and everything try to get good teachers and then you know its always has to do with money an them not making enough money which the teachers dont make enough money and theyre overworked and all these big large class rooms it just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a click together you know itd be hard for them to intervene and say al whats going on in your life whics whats the problem you know thats thats not really should be their roll but im if they care enough they should call their parents and say look worred about your son he misses lots school or hes starting to dress really you know sometimes and it shouldnt be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way it does involve dress and just you know turning against the norm of the society you know and if hey dont wat to be in sports thats fine theres so many different things at they can do in in school and learn about arts and music and you know but im un fortunae lt i think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents cant do but in some ways its always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home you know i mean

am nad to sond like a broken record but i really think its ar a backslide on on family units i think its too easy to sday and ive been married an divorced so ive unfortunately have that experience to me am that its too easy to get divorced a people dont really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that i dont want to say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important am because lets face it to me love is a choice because theres times when i dont love my husband i want to smack hi and hes being a little barney but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes and letn behold o an hour later week later whatav whatever long it takes im in love with him again i mean really you know whatim sayng and am i think its just too easy to get divorced i dont believe in staying into marriage for the sake of the children but i think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it you can have a great relationship you can have kids and bring im up in a more stable environment a unfortunately i think thats the problem parents a er a either getting divorced and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you n usin the kid is a medium am or they are too selfish and dont listen to their kids or they didnt i dont wat to say selfish but lets face it like we said you know even having a dog take some time out of yours your your schedul an am not spend enough time with the kids you know theyre workin weten onit and it takes a lot of effort to race kids these days and actually listen to em and get to know them and let them grow in things like that ah and i dont think enough families are doing that

i think more what they need to do is in strict er oh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shooting amd things like that ah because i mean for the most part i mean people relly dont get too badly punished for things i mean i feelike in other countries i mean like people like the age and countries places like that i mean taave really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism yourself serving jail time and get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean in some cases thatl leave i chain you up in beatyo in public for it ah and i think not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with it i mi think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they can get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone yoyoue not even get thirty days in jail and here can be let go i mean its an awfully small price to pay for

if she could have become the candidate she might have been able to beat i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but a nin election time a week end is a couple of centuries a year is an eon you kno so anything hitd happened between now and then but i think a dull had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderateand will go with the moderate candidate h which is basically were clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in ah most real democrats the warn badies of the world and many yo congressmen an and senators dislike clinton because they didnt think he was democratic enough ah i liked clinton because as i said over the years ive learned that extremes in either party dont get elected and that if you want some one that has your general interest at heart you have to find some one whos a moderane and can can appeal to everybody i used to tell school districts when i went into tell him how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my age but that there was about thirty per cent of the people who were were for you the yes votes thirty per cent who were automatically against you the no votes and thirty per cent in between i told them ignore the now votes no just just dont get hem upset with you you dont want em you know working actively against you lock up your youre thirty that are with you make sure you know youd do something with them but this group the the middle thirties i called them you had to misage them and thats what clinton did so well and thats what dull could have done im not sure if george bw is going to be able to ah because to get the nomination eventually hes gong to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is im anti abortion im pro gun hes aready said the pro gun and thats isgoing against what most americans are saying dull i think represented where most americans are if youle look at apinion poles ah so you know you have to find a way toto moderate that stants ah whether yore republican or democrat

iyou know i think to i apologize to my oldest daughter amost every day about the poor thing all i put her through when we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i wasnt a child but its like you dont have realistic expectations of what what children are capable over what they can do because if theyre really verbal ama kids always have been really verbal because ive talked to them from the moment they were born even what you know when they couldnt talk to me that was irrelevant i was talking to them the whole time i would sly yo coulnd see i dont shut up so i would talk to them the whole time and so they would always be really rerbal and so it would seem like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could like when my daughter was about five we gout a hampster ow i simple you know you make sure you give up food and water and when it died and i was so surprised that she hadnt given in ben givin im food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you dont they dont get that stuff together or when she was eleven we sold her bed room furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else while within three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year n to have she only had a adress on the floor in her room because but i mean all that was bazaar now with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things ori would take more responsibility rather than especting them to have it and secondly

lassy i think i could summarize ajust with a few word to what youre meaning to say may be wrong but i think youre really meaning to say we must get back to the family there must be two parents and they must recognize their children and do like you have just discussed do with them and because today were just drifting and drifting and drifting we a fifty per cent of everyone who marries as divorce within a matter of about five years as i understand the statistics to day and unfortunately its still increasing but there is a strong feeling that may be this going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reversed probably a once again we are talking about communications too and the communications can be ill an they cang be great as shes touched upon but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from the non family were headed to it or have been headed to r and get back to a very basic family ornientation it its abhorrent when i hear that te a well was it seven ladies who are quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell there a sperm f not their sperm whatever that is they sell a for ten thousand dollars apiece and bein flanted another so that itsta can produce a quote beautiful child well i beautiful child an if youre talking about just a physical features it is meaningless its what is imbodied in that body thats can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at and that to me is abhorrent such a such an ideain that indeeds going to take a way from family i in my way of tthinking i cant imagine that i would ahave my wife producing somebody elses child rand im going to have the same thank you thats exact fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toard were with that child

you know technically theres insanity and there isn insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is an insane and a just to to knock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them i mean not in the terms of a christian saving but a to make them work that off and a face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt unoe so ive got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and other side is if we keep a i believe in the a a reincarnation en law cause an effect and if a person murders somebody they need though they will pay for that later theres no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their a their guilt and what theyve done and and a lot of em dont they say that hardend criminals real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to

right t hesame way with kids if you have a penalty for them theyll learn their lesson but its also the parent that has to set the example and theres too many older folks right now i dont think because if two people had to work outside the house they get home theire agrabade their up set somebody else tht had their kids all day and its its is terrible that the situations got that way but i do plead that the older people including our government people and everybody at he the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (6072/ 9618) 
as he was speaking and as he started to speak i realized to another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are as because the world in essence is getting smaller because a communication has gotten better and all these other countries and us are just like all one country any more or something and i think thats had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (6073/ 9618) 
oh 

Recording: (6074/ 9618) 
that was up the age eighteen to or thereabouts i think that the you sad to get back to the very beginning of the birth an up tou kennigard and so forth thats thats the family i think that we in our educational programme we really need to start teaching arwhat i call the older values but ut bu good values i dont can whether there old or new but good values and i think we really need to have that efstablish within our educational system a starting in the elementarang right on up through college i think there ought to be a number of college courses that to devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and a assist in teaching but i think that th many of the courses other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value family values i could even so go so far as to say in chemistry or botany or psychology any one of those those are specialized subject and and but i think there are elements that thay can have within each one of those talking about family value famly value and tat will help then permeate the entire society but is got to start back here in that first and i think 

Recording: (6075/ 9618) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service i guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there its such a burocracy

oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids lot of kids are on medication to day that shouldnt be but a i think thats the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that like for example when weve refer kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they wont just give this kid a pill if he doesnt have eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever so we refer em to those doctors and then if this those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put em on meds its usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the week ends and its just to help em focus and then these doctors also asked for reports back from the teachers and if you dont see any appreciable difference in two or three weeks then you take the kid often you try something else and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you cant believe its the same kid other kids dodnt face em they mis well be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headaches from dexodrine and ad or all so i say you know if it works use it if it if it doesnt work just forget it but ow a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because there may be just not able to pay attention a little bit but there not really a d d and the parents are taking em in and going johnys not getting straight ays put yom on something so i guess

well unfortunately i dont think its fair but i think in the long run it doesnt have to be a college education because most of those people prr wouldnt want a college education ah but like a trade or a skill or something thatll give em a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice iup in their head ok i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun am i mean if they want a college education ah yet itits not fair but for for you growing up and going into a life style i would prefer having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens then somebody robbing me some day because they didnt get an education i mean thats a broad spectrum and i know its not all that cut and dried ah yet would upset me but hopefully id step back from it a little bin and go well maybe it is for the best

Recording: (6382/ 9618) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will also be changing in the future ah going all the way back a finances wer were not a consideration n it o i say probably mi first thirty may be forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influence was not financial it was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know thats not right ihe swayed them with a position that he had developed ow thats not necessarily his opinion so im tryn to make a point the but he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from a various people within his community whether whether youre talking about a township or county state whatever it may be and yes then pslowly then i think the finances came in the play and finances have come to a horrible horrible situation as of to day and ill leave out this the last two years it because its cause its rather sspecific right now but going back the two years or four years ago finances were still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on ea national level but imsing even on local levels i know within the immediate community there are people out there ah i come on well go to dinner well go to this and well do this and do this just just barely barely breaking athe barrier but not breaking the law h soyes very definitely progressively has changed

a k its part of growing up ive been there done that too but still you have to you have to a know theres respect out there to be warranted and you expect it and not just demand it youve got to you have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it but then they solve the interaction with the elder people the school he went to theres a lot of public envovement public service required the teachers i often asked the teachers ive gone to sporting events and the re teachers are there ticket takers a monitorying the crowd where the kids i asked answerd do you gons ever to go home no oh yel is it but theyre always there theyre not theyre just teaching a class theyre not there preparing the class theyre ther after the class theyre there for the student and they make the student feel part of the family that is a continuation of my philosophy at home we interact the school is great you have people thet are on the clock whp time to quit theyre gone those people knont know the meaning of life they will never know the meaning of life but if they stay around try to extend themselves a little more with somebody thats have problems at work and are willing to work with that person i say willng to work not knowing theyre goig be compensated because theyll be compensated notnessary materialistically theyll be on then when theyre expected theyll be compensated somewhere but the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing wha ge whats whats ini for me whats in it for you is intangible are you willing

if they hold you know enough of my views im not going to vote for a woman just because theyre a woman an im not goin to vote for a democrat just gcause theyre a democrat theyd better have it you know at least and and i dont need a hundred per cent a agreement with my views but i li to beat in the ninety to ninety five per cent range but a i dont tend to vote straight party line either as i said ive ive moderated from when i was in college to to day part of the the aging process and also partly because ive ive noticed that to get things done you have to have a centr and its the center that tends to rule when i was in college am we had a bumper sticker that taid america fix it or forget it and some of the construction people in date an came out with one that said america love it or leave it and to day i realize that both of those positions are wrong its america love it and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you dont let them you know have bad manners at the table and you dont let them run around with the wrond yow kids and you want them to behave well yof thats how i see america now and and america has become more centrist and when it deviates from that either way thats when people become upset am si yusthing is important i i remember when who was the other president that i voted for that wone carter black leaders would meet with him oncs a week and then theyd come out and hold this press conference and complain about he didnt do this for blacks and he didnt do tha nough for blacks en didnt do this and he didnt do that and i used to say somi to some of my black friends tdont you see what youre doing dont you see the greater implications of this oh no we need to have him move faster i said ou know theyd be great and an ideal world this isnt an ideal world you have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not i what youre going to do is youre goig to make it look like he is so bad and all the issues youre goig to give people a reason to vote against him then if any big issue comes up thats just gong to be added to everything else what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him his come out in praise him and that hes doing a good job and that were moving along steadily and you know i dont think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means ah i made that mistake when i was president of the date and education association we were trying to get a levey past so we weng around as teachers showing all the bad conditions in the school all the leaking we know a seelings all o the pealing floors all the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind of tuff nd it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said were not going to support thos and they voted no so the next time we did an opposite tract we went in and we said a eighteen months later won the boared put another am ba levy on the the ballot we said these are great sgchool we have great teachers look at this kid hes learning to read hes made six months improvement in three months and all that kind it was image and we were saying the same thing you know we wang to continue this we wong to make even this better a we learned to say the negatives in a positive way and thats important and you need to get thats that you need to appeal to the center americans dont like extreme liberals they dont like extreme conservatives they want they want peace

adoption is different i think though that when adoption is entirely different than when you conceive somebody elses spirm or somebody elses whatever a because adoption means that i cant have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and here gin youre reaching out to your friend your neighbor youre not just forgetting about i and let the wellfare someb take care of im and let him go down the drain and i think that thats what adoption is andand youre really accepting this responsibuilityn thats lup and when youre trying and willing to have well some people wuld probably argue about this but i am sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child why should i try to implant somebody elses inside on me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and youre already aware to a certain extent of what jeans they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you dont later on youll find out but istill you can go back and you can find the parent and i dont know whether theyre goin to be able to trace these jeans back and say you kno later on if something happens to this child youre having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if youve adopted a child you can go back and can find itt and help the child better

when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found the jeffersons offensive in many ways cause it was sterea typical and made fun ofof black people an many ways in retrospect it was tren setting and what it didnt and even in putting blacks in ah advertisements on t v young kids saw them and saw those adds and saw those t v programmes and so it became a part of everyday life and the more you see something the more it bebecomes more acceptable so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now well look back on those t v programmes and think they were tren setting instead of stereal typical ah bim sure it does have a some influence cause i think it did it wasnt the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that that helps i think matthew shepard helped also

i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person theres another rule over says a thats oka if that other person does it to you i mean thmy mothers to say for every lawl that was written theres another law written over here that will actually nullify that one and asked to ask ive grown older i found at and itsits worse than to days world as i sai has the silver rights moveit and you have a right to this and you have a right to that its terrible murderers can get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is a most thing that ever was passed i dont think there should be any plea bargains an inthe piece o wo mould there are people who ged murdered an innocent electric chair lectric chair i still believe in it because if someone is prove and i dont believe that they should have ten years of a what do they call that legal process where they can theputting appeals thank you thats it i dont think that he should have that either one of peal or two should be the limit if there still found guilty sorry and if an innocent person hasnt been able to prove hes innocent thats just one of those freaky things that happens because some times innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else thats guilty thats corrupt enough at his mind that he kwas how to get away with it and get somebod else take his blame but i dont think theres that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have nullified that because what right does that person have to live tevy just about two or three days ago and heres this guy down the south then and as hes walked out handcuffe behind him and to putn him to cruizer wa bi did two exactly what i sait is go to dois go suswhatch her draw her last breath he killed her now hes got to go and prive meyd be a plea bargain and hell get off with it because maybe he wad abused as a child n it had someting do wit the w his thinking what happened to this woman because of it im sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice three four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that

like im a philosophy minor so like if you look like different ethical theories and stuff like yo like theres a hierarchy kind of thiss what ive found theres a hierarchy of things that are ah like the inalienable rights for instance like i cant if you come into my house and rob me and then run outside i knock in it i dont like to kill you for stealing my property like theres a hierarchy there ah for stealing another life thats why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like theres nothing like if i if its inalienable the definition is its not able to be taken not even by yourself thats why you cant commit suicide and since its the highest thing because without it you cant even do the other its so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because without that you cant do the you cant be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if its inalienable because i dint give it to you i cant take it back you never forfeited that you never gave me that right so thats what i feel like i could never want that in to kill another person

civil rights um well i take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion um yathere on paper which is a good thing cause it was a terrible thing when er there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating and equal in fair society maybe som my leftes positions will come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based upon where where in the social stratum you are born in the united states i you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these class nan i dont want to say class lines because that has so many like historical comnetations case its not the exact same as they class was in the markses sense but class lines still to day very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job thats going to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in real terms in things i think were valuable to the individual

and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign h in ohio i think its easier to do that because there is a law that i dnt think its in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have to put up a list of a registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i used to do as i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or wht was undecided on the election and i would cross off those that had voted and then i had a list of those that hadnt and i had people waiting at a phone bank and id call em at work or at home and and id offer to take em to the poles if you dont have a ride ah we will take you to the poles if youre worried about know some one watching your kids we have certify teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babbys sit for you while you go to vote because ive also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office you on knare reminded to go vote well also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that cause what i did was is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say hi this is reberta im calling to remind you that to day is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote and oh by the way oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levey and if you need a ride let me know weve got em set up for you and but you know thats very i mean and thats not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should thats a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate i dont know how you get people to vote i ont kno why they dont think its importan mabbe because weve had it too easy my got my grandfather didnt my grandfather didnt i mea there was a king amd queen and he had no right to vote so t when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him andhe just passe it on to ou know his daughter my mother my father dont know how he it was important to him but was always important to him we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes we talked about issues and he said you know it s important to to be heard so i ont know if it was hat it got passed on parent wise or what it was

i blame it on that yaw because you know theres been a lot more kids that have died in school then you know just recently i guess it wasnt in the bige numbers at one time but theres been random violence in schools you know where kids have died even more thand you know seven or whatever and i think that the medy has just made it into something if theyve glamorized it and some of the kids i think theyre screwed up anyway and theire dislike will hay you know i can do that and ill be on the tya i do i think thats the big part of that cause they want their name known and they dont care if they die anyway

actually there they are working on it im sorry dontmean toontruptia a theyve theyve am just in stated some bona schemes were as the poverty let level i think itis considered them thirteen thousand pounds a year a and if if youre below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like extra bonous beyond yo so theres a bonus for back to work you mention earlier about like how this would affect the children with this two year welfare thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system theyare for for whatever reason than i do about the sitem here which ju kind of unfortunate but a there i mean i dont really think in a lot of situations of course im sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who who really need it and who really you knw takin care of their children but unfortunately you dont really see that side very much you see the people who like theyr kids see none of that money you know theyre left at home by themselves if if they can even you know get them to school if they even go to school if theyre even bothered you know and you know those you know lt theyre theyre document trees on all the time there so you really sort of its more in your fhace than in is here that i ever noticed am but i do think and and with that they have specific programms for the children and a i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if if a kit has bad behaviour or you know bad attendants that you send them home i mean i think thats the most ridiculous thing like surely thats not a punishment for a lot of these kids and you know at least in england on these things ive seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever going around the neighbourhood shop lifting boing you know hot wiring cars at the age of yo now ten or something and i dont know i think i do have sort of very strong opinions about people you know who having all these kids and dont take care of them at all

those are as i think you were implying those are needs to those people but they arent a so howd we correct some of this weve got to i think weve got to cut out a lot of this luxury weve got to slowly bring quote the family back home a and i dont necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man tho cares in to days work a were far less agriculturally related a were form wore in serveice oriendtation and manufacturing orientation so a man and a man o woman ma fre phrase a woman can do most of the work at is being done outside of the home to day versis what they could have done as agricultural people aand once again though that would bring people back to this central family make up just has to be communications communications as its going its irreversable ai think it can be re directed an much in the manner sheis speaking a and where des this start i think it hav start back here and first grade tiy think parents must participate with teachers as we used to was just commona you could walk in and sit down and watch the students or participant participate and or assist what to day they have these assistants but theyre hired directed assistants theyre not in theire portraying or passing there on the values of the community to the students so i think thats i guess i comwell continue to come back to family to family almost everything is got to be come back to family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis
