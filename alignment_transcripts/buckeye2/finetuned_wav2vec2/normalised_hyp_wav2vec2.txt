right but the ones that are raising are the ones that are the standards in the fields but right and but more and more of those are also available on the web but you have to subscribe to them so it is till an institutional subscription i mean that is a constant problem for the serials people everywhere ia it just it is incredible what is happened with the cost you know i mean i have seen articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year 

Recording: (9/ 9620) 
but what what does it tell us about our people we are so niivend we have got to look in aside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that coald be more beneficial and most of the time it is listening 

Recording: (10/ 9620)

Recording: (12/ 9620) 
i have learned a lot about cooking lately 

Recording: (13/ 9620) 
uu 

Recording: (14/ 9620) 
so juist trying to take my time do what i want to do yeah 

Recording: (15/ 9620) 
i am a senior and i just started the my art major in spring so i still have about four quarters left but i am a senior 

Recording: (16/ 9620) 
it iss 

Recording: (17/ 9620) 
yeah it is projected like six years to take to finish some of these projects it is on real well i know when we drove through georgia you actually see people working on the road there is a whole bunch of people and they are all out there working you know and you get to ohio there is that ido not know some thing on david david letterman had a picture of this and i think i have seen it before that big sin an says you are tax dollars at work you know and there is the construction guys smoking a cigaret leaning up against the side kind of thing lke great thi r kind of funny 

Recording: (18/ 9620) 
it is just the way it is i guess but it is like you know she says if the mother is in the house the mother is on duty 

Recording: (19/ 9620) 
yes 

Recording: (20/ 9620) 
really 

Recording: (21/ 9620) 
r right but at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested and and there was a lot of i have always loved to travel by car yeah it is it is fun and it is probably because of that early conditioning <laugh> i have been i have been in forty eight states 

Recording: (22/ 9620) 
no it was his mom ran away so hat happened 

Recording: (23/ 9620) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (24/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (25/ 9620) 
it is curious is not it 

Recording: (26/ 9620) 
i do not know um like iu said i mean it is something i basically see it almost as being the same thing is like cigaoretes or whatever where i mean yeah it is bad for you there is a lot of tarand it things like that but as far as what it the effects it does to you it is no worse than anything alcohol can do to you u so i mean i do not know i mean it i am not sure if they should actually go so far as to legalize it but i do not think it is really something that they need to really spend that much time trying to control drug problem wase the thing is coming in i mean i know i think it is like switterland or somewhere like that where they have legalized drugs and they basically do it government based where the government actually gives them out and the government git s the money for it um i coulnd almost see thav as being almost a good idea heare i mean obviously like u said people are going to do it no matter what i meane same thing with guns if they want it they will get their hands on iti does not matter what they have to do to it thog they will come buy it um i mean i i i mean i coul see that they could at least take the money from it and put it do a better use of some sorts if they did the same kind of thing 

Recording: (27/ 9620) 
because not only is he i shopin is pig but he is a bigget too <laugh> ariza is yeah so 

Recording: (28/ 9620) 
all you do is you just keep your records of of um you know what you spend on things and then there is a formyufill out and how much you have if you have taken any depreciation you know you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost and then there is a percentage that goes on your schedule ethat goes an the front of your form that goes into your income and then it is just taxed it is just no it is really not that hard 

Recording: (29/ 9620) 
i well i hope they keep it 

Recording: (30/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (31/ 9620) 
yeah i really really hate the fact of government telling me what to do 

Recording: (32/ 9620) 
an my sudend think the freshman class just ride along i think the freshman is would be little bit tougher you know they would be tougher to be walking around know in different areas like me i did not know where this hall was i was out there with fifty million halls around me and just stopped once and i said we re as lazanby and they that way not too far from where i parked 

Recording: (33/ 9620) 
and that is the way i felt about it and not i am not saying that that is not a possibility but 

Recording: (34/ 9620) 
yeah well like the catelog s real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and like the cataelog has like a hundred of them anso that is really anoying too because then people call up with all these like things that we like do not know if we have and our computers are really really old like it is like an old stywl main frame

Recording: (53/ 9620) 
oh yeah yeah and i i think i think even even if you are aware of everything that is here you still in the back of your mind you just have that it is co it is just columbus it is just columbus i maybe it is because um people do not take advantage of do not realize what is actually here um do not realize how i i mean yeah it is not chicago it is not new york it is not sanfrancisco there is a lot of places it is not but it is u you know it is not a backwater either wealthy need to get out more <laugh> i mean you know all this oh we will never be a major lege city until we have major leage sports it is well i you know i guess u getting out more would not help those peopl it is um um that that would be h you know that would be such a small part of of civilization anywhere for me and um i am pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and i just i i i really do think people do not take advantage of it the way they should 

Recording: (54/ 9620)

Recording: (61/ 9620)

Recording: (64/ 9620) 
yeah so that is taking some running around 

Recording: (65/ 9620) 
um i think some of it was not i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely um you do go through a period in your life where you do not feel like you have any frends or you feel totally different i mean i still go through that i think we all go through that to some point or other evhen yearly for some of us um so i am just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family i say he using those for example or the parents paid a little bit more attention and did not have that blind ey i think that is part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrong doing and your child is eys you need to really admit it um i mean you do not want to do that but 

Recording: (66/ 9620) 
no no i am i am interested 

Recording: (67/ 9620) 
the lower grades we have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many but i think that young men young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a a man earlier on rather than having to wait until they are in middle school to relate to a coach and up until then it is always been a woman 

Recording: (68/ 9620) 
man this one i cord a ding so 

Recording: (69/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (70/ 9620) 
oh 

Recording: (71/ 9620) 
you know my daughter you know there is just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i would call up to the school and you know the principal s like you ehe o say mis you know i am i um her last chance you know my daughter was going to summer school every summer and he is like mysis you know she is like you know the average student uh she is the type you know that she is going to get you know she is ut going to get through college you know she is just one of those you know that just moves right along you know she is not the brightest you know but she is bright enough and those are your average professional people out working today and o it is just like well i just want more help for my daughter you know i just want somebody the you know jurk her down 

Recording: (72/ 9620) 
that is great 

Recording: (73/ 9620) 
they had ton they just called me on the phone not knowing you know just that she went to the hospital well they said to me will you stay while i said yes but then uh uh when it got into two weeks and i was not getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything so ike i am sorry i am a substitue substitute i am getting sixty dollars a day i can not do this unless you know i have more help and i just flatly said that i am sorry i mean if i if it was my own job i would have strugled with it but i was not my own job and i did not know what was going to happen so if they would have gotten some help in there for me i would have stayed perhaps but no i i you know you can work for underpay and understaff and ever you can not do everything so 

Recording: (74/ 9620) 
uh threatening her and stuff like that and uh what all i would have to do is get on the phon and sit ther and say you know i cano be out there in about two hours you know so i do not know what your problem is but you need to get eve talke to me about it talk to your mom about it or go see somebody else and talk to them bout t 

Recording: (75/ 9620) 
uh 

Recording: (76/ 9620) 
and decided to go back for their jobs it if you noticed the first time that they voted they voted down this proposal the proposal that they are voting on this week is the exact same one 

Recording: (77/ 9620) 
and i am just useing that sing excample you know i mean you re other drugs i do not know much about them 

Recording: (78/ 9620) 
hey could do it my grand my one granddaughter uh they live in springfild they just moved to springfild and she goes to kindergarten only a half day and this child is only uh five years old uh he has them reading the newspaper watching the news she told me a story aboutchristifer columbus uh discovering america that was so deep and intense i could not believe it was coming from a five year old so this is what the teacher is doing down there 

Recording: (79/ 9620) 
ah 

Recording: (80/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (81/ 9620)

Recording: (83/ 9620) 
um-hum

uhum 

Recording: (85/ 9620) 
no there was a lot of conflict at home uh my dad uh had to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities and uh she was kind of crazy 

Recording: (86/ 9620) 
i think it is probably two though that a lot of people hav are not used to it i mean they are not from ohio i have found that in collumbus a lot so they are kind of you know more tentative or they are rom the south or something like that so theyand then you run into a lot of people that arere from ohio but i have noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbas so 

Recording: (87/ 9620) 
oh okay that was easy 

Recording: (88/ 9620) 
and he is real because people give him that 

Recording: (89/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (90/ 9620) 
yeas 

Recording: (91/ 9620) 
you know so basically well yeah it might work but to me it is kind of stupid you know because what you are saying is we are going to take this law and we are really going to stick you on this law but the hell with all the other laws so is that really fair 

Recording: (92/ 9620) 
that is great 

Recording: (93/ 9620) 
oh is that right 

Recording: (94/ 9620) 
yah 

Recording: (95/ 9620) 
so 

Recording: (96/ 9620) 
um 

Recording: (97/ 9620) 
yep 

Recording: (98/ 9620) 
um he he is a sub contractor an if uh someone is got a job to do t at their house h he will do it you know like we we just went and toward the cabinets out of a a house that was on fire and because o the smoke damage 

Recording: (99/ 9620) 
the hours with because gesan works during the day too so it would probably work out pretty well for us 

Recording: (100/ 9620) 
all of his problems have been personal problems that really should not have been touched on except the media got into it and um i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they were not that shocked that a president would do something like that 

Recording: (101/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (102/ 9620) 
boy that is that is a really tough one i had not not thought about that and and high school kids are so touchy about i mean about touchy about sexual identity and and so likely you know so insecure in their own that they are really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a has a different orientation and i i do not know i do not know 

Recording: (103/ 9620) 
i went to uh um the just about just a little uh east of here high school

Recording: (106/ 9620) 
and one of them they looked at in collumbus was uh how whell he was doing in school wellf children off have the hig one of the highest dropperar outrates in schools and they are not doing well so they need to be taught differently and then they cut this money my my feeling is you know there s a lot of programs in school that sponsered by the federal government particularly uh to help the the students are that are behind and that is important 

Recording: (107/ 9620) 
hen they are giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who is making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i do not care if i get five dollars the will not even buy me a tank of gas today keep the money and do something good with it

h they uh stopped federally funding uh osu that was a federal control tower and they contracted it out so you either lost your job and stayed there and workedfor the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people moved like to arisona and california and and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years until i retire and i really like columbus and i thought i do not want to uprop my daughteris out of school and and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port columbus and suffer it out until i can 

Recording: (204/ 9620) 
so i guess i mean that went well that was really really hard for me i would call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed but i do not know i could not tell you what he went through with that cryang spell but he did go ho that where he just did not quit crying 

Recording: (205/ 9620)

city council of daton and had higlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line and should have going to columbus at the same time ther insti 

Recording: (208/ 9620)

yeah and i really think both of them will be good parents someday but she says we are not ready

well personally i voted that the thirty three should pass i think they should the way i undertood they have ways of wording those things that you have to read it very carefully n ot kno whether you should say yes or no on thing i said yess because i uh annalized it to say that they are repealing something that was passed i think one or two years ago thete was allowing things to be done up aroundin the polearius area like new roads and this and that and i want that repealed because i do not think we should be helping anybody else to do that andt taking the money away from the other things 

Recording: (212/ 9620) 
oh my god 

Recording: (213/ 9620) 
ey are just like it a little less or dislike it a little more when when it it looks like it is going to come to somethig it looks like they are it feels like they are trying to tease me as an audience and u i that is not something i feel teased by particularly

whenever he runs well i thought he was going to be elected uh mayor too but he did not there but i do not know what that was about but um uh you know he is got his constintuants and they are going to reelect him because he stands up for the minority i think he what he makes a mistake as saying labeling thing races that are not necessarily races but anyway 

Recording: (220/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (221/ 9620) 
yeah it is just like uh having alcohol around i mean gambling is a lot f like alcohol can be addicting it could screw your life up and you will spend your last dollar on it if you are that far gone so pretty much anything can be one of those factors <laugh> 

Recording: (222/ 9620) 
um i would agree that i think regardless of your race you should be able to adopt child i mean just because you are black kid living with like a white family does not mean you can not still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of i mean it is the same thing wi it is like irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it is no different i mean as long as basically you know youre roots and where you came from i mean i do not can not see a being a problem of any sort um i mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for them i mean i can not see it being any 

Recording: (223/ 9620) 
i personally agree with that but that is just from my own moral beliefs and everything but i do not know i i do not think that there is one solution that will fit every every child in every situation you know mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so you know obviously his and he said his dad told him about condems you know so they are going to make that decision on their own i would say just and and plus what the intornat and everything they they have access to so much information i i think that it falls back on the parents sto if youare going to be a parent you need to be responsible and i do not think that it is getting done 

Recording: (224/ 9620) 
i know 

Recording: (225/ 9620) 
um in general i think i think the united states has i a fairly well developed like cls not like class structure in which you can not move up or down but like we have a a fairly large middle class

Recording: (312/ 9620) 
i think i think they shoud um i think a lot of the fear of this material comes uh from people who hold the belief that that you choose your orientation or that you can be converted to homo sexuality and i personally do not believe that so it uh you know i am not affraid of it but i can see how people would hold the opposite view and that i that is where this com comes from but since i think they are wrong <laugh> i think it should be my way and i think i think you know i think the material should be there i think it you know dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and i think it should be accessable to the kids 

Recording: (313/ 9620)

it is so i just see a pattern you know i just feel like this is going ta happen to me eventually 

Recording: (404/ 9620) 
i was going to say ie i have seen situations too where i can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to or the wives hare used to be ing home and the husband is support them and in those situations they still want them to they still do not want to go out there and do that and um and you know they need to look at each one of those cases too because i know there is allamoni and all that kind of thing and and that can be detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know 

Recording: (405/ 9620) 
where are youfrom 

Recording: (406/ 9620) 
igsum i think the fact things like responsibility maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of of their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of uh you know things as far as people getting pregnant hend and then this person goes off and and you have thend you have got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves and and it is just it is more socially acceptable to to be able to do these things now than i think it was a long time ago i mean people is families when and when noor stand for something like that they sey look you need to take care of this you need to deal with tis and now it is just is kind of mormal and everybody just kind of goes along with it 

Recording: (407/ 9620)

Recording: (497/ 9620) 
we are buying it yeah and we shuld have a paid off about five years uh then we are talking about moving to some place a little simpler to take care of 

Recording: (498/ 9620) 
donot know lik i think u i think uh high school in general like the people aways talk about raising the standards you know for for high school teings but um i think um it is kind of like it is it is really hard to uh like i have tought about it before it just what is wrong with like the education system in general like i do not know i think it is more of uh more of like uh it is college is a little bit different i guess but it is more of like this whole like the teacher the teachers talking id like it like the information goes from like the like the teachers uh mouth to the students to know it is just like outgo without going through either their brains you know it is like just like real monotonous and like you kno dates and babblaw about you know just like it is it is it is real structuren but it is real hard to think about what the what ik what to do to change that i it is kind of like more like i d not know i mean i had really good like there was a couple of raly good teachers like my history teachers and english teachers were really good um 

Recording: (499/ 9620) 
was she where is she was from ot in america 

Recording: (500/ 9620)

Recording: (501/ 9620) 
you see 

Recording: (502/ 9620) 
and you do not the problem is as a youngster as your grow up you do not realize how much your parents did for you until you are probably until you are about thirty five forty o do not realize my goodness my am dad you made a sacrifice because now i am learning and littn morethn what you did and then by the time you are uh maybe sixty fifty sixty now you e guys take care of take care of your parents if you had the morals to do it otherwise you just ship them out to the farm 

Recording: (503/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (504/ 9620) 
the three ars you know i think those are still very important 

Recording: (505/ 9620) 
a rght and they were actually able to sellect a couple from a they talked to a lawyer who rangees options and she had a file and they you know threw kind of bunch of questions and the answers type thing were able to limit o n the three couples and they liked the first couple they met so 

Recording: (506/ 9620) 
go along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way why you just do not question that and i just do not do that it is wrong 

Recording: (507/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (508/ 9620) 
yeah because i do not have a degree 

Recording: (509/ 9620) 
and a lot of it was the the bitterness of the divorce 

Recording: (510/ 9620) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (511/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (512/ 9620) 
hey do not do it today unless the person is a scholar i mean a you three point eight road scall or anything hey okay 

Recording: (513/ 9620) 
so it is it is been very difficult for us particularly the last four years and about the time he ran away was between the time my fatherinlaw diedn my motherinlaw died which was in a five month period so my wife is had a lot lot to deal with uh and she is had a lot to deal with in that time 

Recording: (514/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (515/ 9620) 
just 

Recording: (516/ 9620) 
right the hardest both the hardest and easiest thing i think i have ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him uthanized 

Recording: (517/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (518/ 9620) 
no i would not 

Recording: (519/ 9620) 
getting them someplace stable 

Recording: (520/ 9620) 
i think it is the right position to take um but it it like abbortion that is one of the the big issues that divide people very quickly um i think it is moderating somewhat uh as the gay activist continue their campaigns um but that is one wherea candidate has to tread very carefully um i was proud that colman said it and did it and and did not back down on that um they told me a little bit about his character um i do not know that i can anser your questions straight forward because i believe in gay rigt i believe in anybody is rights i what happens between concenting adults and a bedroom is their business not mine 

Recording: (521/ 9620) 
yeah it was like yeah um it was five weeks early delivering so it was really you know unplanned as far as when we were expecting it 

Recording: (522/ 9620) 
o 

Recording: (523/ 9620) 
i do not know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with um chief jackson and the whole mayoryal kandidates how they are getting debates over that and i know this is something knew on top of that um i know it was a front page on sunday is paper i looked at it breefly u i think there must be some truth to it i do not know the extent 

Recording: (524/ 9620) 
well i would say in springfieled yeah 

Recording: (525/ 9620) 
right rightan i think there is yo kow there is so many small communities like even toug osyu is really obviously it is own it is own little community and then you have got you know dubland and they have got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that that ou there really is a lot of things to do in that own individual area that i can not see somebody from dublen going over to the west side o to do it you you know hat i i do not and and maybe also i i feel safer where i live too and and that is something that is an issue for me i know when i do travel down in cleveland aba makes e it does it makes me nervous so i just kind of stay a way um 

Recording: (526/ 9620) 
um-hum yeah 

Recording: (527/ 9620) 
i was forty eight when i retiredt is uh it is great it was terrific 

Recording: (528/ 9620) 
now well it is like you buy it and then you wod get to do the shopping the fun part you goupan pick out whall paper and cabinets and all this and hat nd then you hase somebody else do that bor but i do not do like major gutting or anything i just like to get something that needs that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen that boba bobla boblba so that is the kind of stuff and i have only done three or four of them but it is fun 

Recording: (529/ 9620) 
um well i think the price has a lot to do with it because i mean that is what i see over there that poravents it you know they are a sort of middlof the line dress that would be like it the limited here or something is you know seventy five pounds you know i like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that is a lot you know you see them un limited and you think whatever the price s expensive but you know really if you buy that you are not really going to be buying fr you know more than one ore like anything else for a while and i think i mean here there is that sort of like you know you has the most winds or whatever that you know prases and you know there is that with cedes and whatever but i do not know i mean even with the food and everything else i mean it is cheap people buy so much of it like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there you know the portions or a lot smaller it is more expensive you just eat less and i mean you just see it contributing to everything i mean the obcity problem here and everything else i mean it is getting worse there than it was but i mean it i nowhere is it anywhere neare and that is a large part of the like problem with that people work constantly on me about ai americans ou like all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

Recording: (530/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (531/ 9620)

Recording: (673/ 9620) 
yep 

Recording: (674/ 9620) 
uh 

Recording: (675/ 9620) 
yeah i just renewed myrtificut last year so i may gt ack nto it part of the reason i renewed my cirtificut was i did somec chome instruction with ha columbu publics schools las year and that is kind of like a tutering job where you can go interrange hours with the student that is at home for some reason uh i had one that just had a baby <laugh> and uh they it is an interesting job because they looked for somebody that can cover the most technical lik uss subjec that the student istaking in my case at turned out to be chemistry in one i think chemistry once ind it it was uh algebra to another time <laugh> n bugt they expected us to at least they expected me uh to cover the other subjects two or at least to spend a little bit of time on them so there was english and there was histery so it really requires you to be well rounded <laugh> and i i like kind of like that uh i have taught in a couple of other places uh ommunity colleges college in new work i cought a chemistry class their and community college which is in hillsboro but i taught it ther branch and i taught a introduct an introduction to a collegy class theire and an introduction to uh introduction to the artst was called <laugh> and that was interesting it was thether it is kind of an under class of teachers they do no pay you know nough to do that they pay you uh per student contact hhour and in my chemistry class i was teaching i think a total of five or six con tact hours a week and they wer paying something like twenty one or twety tn dollers an hour so 

Recording: (676/ 9620) 
but like to some people that is considered a city so i think it is your perspective in that sense 

Recording: (677/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (678/ 9620) 
okay it was kind of uh it was different when i could see because when i went in uh you know i never had any problem with tha black person or or i do not really care you know as long as they uh did their job and eveything i am basically the same way today uh 

Recording: (679/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (680/ 9620) 
that is not enough i 

Recording: (681/ 9620) 
what they do uh they have like up to four or five months the first four or five months of pregnancy they are a lowed to maintain once they start tho show they do not let them go to the school anymore just for the uh health of the baby 

Recording: (682/ 9620) 
um-hum push ye guet some many different students and wel i like just walking over here today you know i just kind of thought you know i wonder how many of these people i walked by you know are going to be here in january because you know a lot it because i did you know i thought we this iis cold now you know 

Recording: (683/ 9620) 
yeah i really do not know i do not understand why they do not because to me it is the most important freedom we have and people um bitch an complain all the time but then when you askd them if they voteed they go know it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you do not because your voice was not heard um when i was a political action consult andfor the ohigho education association i used to go around and try to get teachers involved in politics um and one of the things i would tell them is that every vote is import and jon kennedy one if if if you would take all of the the votes he wone buy and spread it out across the nation by one vote per er per presinct one vote per presinct you know there i just been one additional vote either way and any of those presings you know he would have lost um and so one vote does count and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes and when i was with the ohigo education association i generally did school leviy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two ceven eighteen nineteen votes um if i knew the magic reason why people do not vote i could sell that and make a make a fortune um but i do not know what it is 

Recording: (684/ 9620) 
yeah yeah because right now you know because he knows how to he is he is learned i wold say he knows more than most kindergardeners so i do not even push anything we do not really have a set schedual right now and i am just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know just if i let him watch something it is educational based usually and i let him play on the computer we will go ta different web sighte sometimes to check out things and i am amazed sometymes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff and just listening because he is hhe listens to everythi 

Recording: (685/ 9620) 
yeah yeah but i i have purposly tried to work close or do the back roads it is nice from hillyard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where i have been working on back roads so it is not that bad 

Recording: (686/ 9620) 
and he said even in h when he was in high school that they hav they had police officers there so that is not like a knew thing but he said you would have people w like nives and youwould have people with fist fights but you ul like guns it was unheard of you know and i think i do not know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh they re people feel dejected in high school i am sure of it you know like i do not i was i did not feel that way but i would like in retrospect i lookd back and i thought you know i am thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like if every day it was like so tramatizing to them lhike that would be like for four years every day you are just like teezsed or something like horrible and you like no one talks to you i damt knot justifying what they do at all but i am saying that would make them more that would probably in their mind give them the reason 

Recording: (687/ 9620) 
and he does not seem he does not seem to have any problem it is always been you know whatever she wants i know so far it is worked out pretty well so you know i am sure in a situation like that things are going no come up but wet we will deal with hit 

Recording: (688/ 9620) 
no 

Recording: (689/ 9620) 
um-hum yeah mi mom are real close 

Recording: (690/ 9620)

Recording: (692/ 9620) 
yeah and i told them i was gong to call up the tv stations so they could fillm me crawling out the door as an osu employe

i check my fax machine the next day it ssays my mother is decided to except your offer and i thigt i she i have no wat visit ind we wan t ging going to do now so i ended up talking to him and i i just explaine to him that um he had caught me off gard and that i would had more time to reconsider it and that because it and it is true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was just not going to work for me he was a nice man i felt bad and so then i gave him some ideas about how he could sell it 

Recording: (695/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (696/ 9620) 
oh 

Recording: (697/ 9620) 
well one thing you know being uh uh i came from basially a poor neighbor p poor uh the life style in early life and everything you know so uh uh if anything i guess i kind of made me negative uh towards people with that had inphiuense and had money in did not do any thing good with that you know i am a pirm believer that if you go something that you should share it with other other people i do not always practice what i preached but you know that is it would be a good philosophy do live buh uh in people of other religiouns and everything uh you know i learn a lot about religion when i i was raised baptist basically but uh i practiced more catholick than anything else now uh but i generally pretty noegebol about judiisom than muslins and everything just because i ave frindol li interesting

Recording: (701/ 9620) 
what department 

Recording: (702/ 9620) 
and any more you are lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody is so busy doing their own thing but as a world i think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you do not really actually speak to the people you are hearing about it on tv or radio or buy a telephone or whatever 

Recording: (703/ 9620) 
vey very much so now twenty fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would caught we would tag that description rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism well in the manner we just defined socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we are no longer a do democratic government as defined back there then uw yeah we are still democratic according to our new definition it is developed over time uh but it is far more socialistic uh but

Recording: (815/ 9620) 
you know we are right there within moments if there is a flood or you know something like that you call the contrare i will be in thursday you know if your air condition so they are always going to haved to have people her so i jus feel they are eithey ar better to down scale the amount of people thay have and get cigly qualified people then have twenty people that half of them know what is going on hap ohm dofn so but that is tough to do when you are start iand people hat eight dollars an hour and stuff so there is you know when thews mecdonals there is the places that you can make that money so um-hum my you know to me the thing that hurt me the mo thouo is they want no put cap on our salary so i am at the highest scale i can go right now as far as job title there is no other job i can move to untilless i move into supervision or someth up and tha in i will be out of the union if i do that anyway so but they are going to put a cap on that where you coan onnly make so much money at a point which i am almost there right now i am only like fifty cents away from that cap and if that is the case if i retire in six years i will be capped out right now so in other words i am going to retire in six years if i do not change jobs making exactly what i mak now which that was my wars feare of it all but that was not even on the negotiating table they were still worried about this two doll whars an get this os yeah that is what they were fighting for was the low end an try to get the hospitl on the main campus the same 

Recording: (816/ 9620) 
yeah so it is it is a really tough thing to do mean you have to be sort of organized and i do not know sort of a maverick i guess because if if you could give a test that would tell who could be an airtraft oner who could not you would be a millionar because the government would buy that from you because intelligence is not a factor i mean there are people who do this job who i mean i are not stupid but they are not college educated and really intelligent but they are extremely good at it and then e other people uh that i know of one that i work with i on a regular basis he is got a master is degree and he is you know he reads continuously he is always up i mean if you ask him anything about like what is going on and overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he is one of our weakest ones you know and it is uh

Recording: (1140/ 9620) 
i think it is really you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them own and how long they stay on it and and most kids do not like being on medication because it makes some different they do not look at it like gee i am really lucky i live an a day and time when there iis a pill to help me concentrate they look at like whell on of my friends have to do anns say w any way m to do it you know they look at it like it is a big pain because they got a run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and generally the long acting the time released one here is only a couple of them a couple of the different medications that are out ind the time release and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release and it wears olwf and it does not do what i isup pose to do so they go back to the six hour doasage you know one the morning on at lunch and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pil and then heir lake to the lunch lwine and you know they just hate it so but it is not something they can a lot of kids will not i guess e aren denial just like we would be they say wht does not help me i do not need it but when you sit down and say okay what are the things you are able to do when you are on it that you really have trouble with when you are off of it and they see it in black and white they go oh

Recording: (1143/ 9620) 
when i did school levy campaign uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the viggest thing is is what the the campaign does on election day called get out the vote that is the most important thing that can be done um i used to always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school leviy get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district and i would have the school district compare it to parents and the first thing i oudo is register parents because many of them do not vote uh and i wread a study somewhere that the average person in this country does not even begin to vote until they are forty if i hauld known that when i was in college and work so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i could not vote until i was twenty one and i was upset you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war that was a big issue and i could not uh i had to wait until i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that you know worked and dit some volunteere worked to get that whole thing changed if i woaud known that they were not going tae vote ad eighteen and we are going towait untill they were almost forty i wald not to i wal nt have wasted my time uh but anyway um you you get parents who ere usually younger especiully of the the first second third grade age

white women who wud actually had it done then uh then um has panic or acfrican american but i do not know at least in that case i mean before we were talking about thegovernmend i mean at least in that case there still is a choice i mean there is money involved but it is it is not so much money that it what rat iclly change ore life in kha sort of you know it is not thousands of dollars it was two hundred i believe and and that is you know i mean if if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction i do not know i think you know theyre is the debate about ten yeoars down the line but wh you know is they are going to be something that is going to make themmen change you know what is i you know what is ey re going to be and like how how realistic is it for you know what percentage i meag ot n kno anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up theire act or anything like that but i meankn i do think if there is that element of choice it is a lot tifferent than you know theyi governmend saying okay this is your cut off lemmend but i mean the statistics they were go giving on um the average number of children that these women we are having and you know you know the average number oe children that we are just taking to the hospital and left there or you knw just dropped off wherever and and the state tha these children were in and their life sbend and everything n else i meag you know there is the human rightes for the mother but what about the human rights for the the child is life you know i meankn i think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and you know the same is in england you know everymen i saying oh becaus they were talking about you know i mean again this was just an idea they are kicking around but sort of you know some how sort of forcing these young girls tot lease be on birth control you know in whatever way and and againd that everywone was up an arms but it is sort of like you know what is that child is quality of life can be when their mothers just you know

Recording: (1178/ 9620) 
so and i figured i have a hundred up to a hundred and fifty four credits and so i am i am up to like ninety four right now and i figure hat would be a deecent i mean it translates over because we are in some musters it will get all h messd up there but it it is it is like i am halfway to three fourths done with the with my degree so if i wantet ta transfer now it would be like because i i after this point if i stay any longer a lot of the credits wil not transfer over be a waste of time because most places do not like to take more than half so that is why i just figure right now i should look 

Recording: (1179/ 9620) 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there is extreme amount of violence in there uh you know just everyone there is a a bad dark side in the story so children just tart and i mean it is in there that and then including my own daughter she and i sware i had her watch mis der rage but now that she is older she watches tv she is addicted to d tv something terrible ind thi so of course her children are uh so but i think you know i was i did not have have tv when i was a child child and i think you know it it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i do not know what direction that imagination really gos you know and but there is a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody is face any more as a matter of fat i am getting so i do not watch the news

hate crime is is nat is an intresting term um all crimes all murders are hate related i i am not sure that is u it it is difficult i we had civil rits lawsd many people were opposed to those but at was a and an effort to correct years uf institutionalized rasishem um and and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalizet hate but a crime is a crime oreyou know are you going to give someone who murdered matheuw shepherd six life terms as opposed to someone who murder someone else one life term i mean murder is murder and there is allready a a law on the books i do not think we need to have i hate crime over and abofe that you know theth the the people who murdered mathew shepherd should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and should not have anything else added into it i i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights ind the uh affermative action programs and the bussing did to people is going to turn people against uh gays like that turn people against blacks for a while although ultimately i think it did make a difference i i had a i have a black friend tat the ohio education association h is very active in the sixties in uh opening up restaurants in the south and marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south and i said to her one day are you duis appointed that things are not better uh you know that people still hate blacks this is ten fifteen years ago and she said know she said that was not my go my goall was not to change hearts and minds my gol was ta change behavior and the behavior changed except now i never thought i wouldp the see an all white jury convict white men of con u killing a black man we are not hearts and minds now

yeah i think they are really helpeful and i think that it is the only way that a single mom or anybody raie ang kids can make it there is really but therye irs so much fraud and there is so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it you know like with me i did not want a stay on that i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it but if i did not have the ambition that that i had i might have stayed home there is like nin you know there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that i would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to the her front step and she drove that year is car i mean she had a brand new you know like whatever year it was that is the car she had and i i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and you know i though 

Recording: (1269/ 9620)

you can not take that away from hem uh you know like you said i think they just go through a lot of of stuff i mean i had a lot of uh you kno a modesity towards my dad things that happe you know uh perhaps not being nher when i was you know were younger and stuff like that then now it i anyting me and my brother got close because of it you know because he is three years older tand me and then uh but but you know nowh you know i do not have they they are both not bogth my parents are passed away but uh you know i do not have any any modesty towards thim at all you know i kind of lik it is kind of like a growing up thing i i guess you know i mean you you kind of set turn se eight you you know heu did the best he could you know i mean 

Recording: (1271/ 9620) 
is often so similar to where i am coming from 

Recording: (1272/ 9620) 
it is a very strong animal and a is the old man they got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out and in my opinion when that stuff happens when i see when i see someone light the horns of a bol on fire and spain and torment the bol and then all of a sudden the bol gets the flames put out and the bol runs his gord through the person is leg and throws them aroundand kicks them right near death i do not have any simpathy for them 

Recording: (1273/ 9620)

Recording: (1280/ 9620)

is it really 

Recording: (1388/ 9620) 
i think people are still fairly races i do not think it is near as bad as it was but at the same time i mean i can not say i blame the white community so much for it i would say it is probably both the white and i guess any other race relations fourt um i mean as far as like feel like the black community things like that yoeah have like bt um yeah i ave like the united negrow college fund things like that where they are almost segragating themselves by having these organizations because they are geared specifically towards black people and i think in the way that is almost segragating themselves from the rest of the community because they are not given out equal opportunity the people that need them um it is sort of like the same thing white people were doing you know thirty forty years ago where that they had their white organizations or what not u and i think it is sort of goingalong the same lines where there is still a problem of it but i think it has gotten better at least if nothing else 

Recording: (1389/ 9620)

Recording: (1980/ 9620) 
ll maybe it is crime is going down in the sense that is applaying you know it is criminals are not as active but there is more and more of these acts of violence and maybe t is because they are so dramatic that you notice it

Recording: (2018/ 9620) 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school i could easily quit like that because the teachers did not i went to a connus public school and it they did not care i mean i i went through elementary and middle school with strt aids and bees and got there and i was on ces to des you know and i just was really the teachers did not care you know if you learned you learne if you do not you do not if you do not come to school you do not they do not care that was how my school was so i do not there i do not there was nothing there that really i can remember that did anything good for me i mean i think middle school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (2019/ 9620) 
here are not as many of them ore you mean because

uh i live up north uh around carroll and uh morc road 

Recording: (2024/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2025/ 9620) 
but it is not gong to work i mean they if you are around people i mean numberon they are around their parents and their ciblings and that is socializatio you go to church or to the library or whereever i mean you are around people and you are around children and they get oh have socialization if you want to call it whatever and i think from everything that i haveread and seen that um they get the socialization that they need at home and they are not relying so much on their peers and their per is opinions because i i for one example the pokimon crase my son that know what pokimon was and tell he heard some otheir kids talking about it and you know it is just like stuff like that it is just like they do not they do not know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid it is pushing it in their face you know and then even still they are just like oh ways cool because everybody else likes it they do not really know what it is or what it is about or i mean you know t i me because it is like they they just blow up each other or whatever it is like really what is the point to the whole thing and he did not know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about i ho he must be cool because some other kid they are talking about it but then heed i sided that it was ot cool soid i was my influ our influence on him rather than the peer is influence on him 

Recording: (2026/ 9620)

he seemed to confuse parenting with controling 

Recording: (2032/ 9620) 
so i am not going to get too much of an attitude from people 

Recording: (2033/ 9620) 
i think it is important to know what the persons values and customs are and to support whatever it is and if i mean we have done some wild things over there but i mean it is i mean we have changed rooms around beds around positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed to face the north star or they needed to have this thing above the bed are under the bed and i mean if it is important for them to haf prayer then i think it is important to get the upperprit people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need 

Recording: (2034/ 9620) 
so 

Recording: (2035/ 9620) 
and i do not really think it is something that needs to be taught um the only thing probably is like where they call that uh cultural diversity or whatever classes they have as take i think that i do not think is such a bad idea uh because just because you grew up and i do not know what i grew up in but i wl i will give an example i did not grow up in let us say somebody they goes hunting and fishing and drives tracks and wears ball caps and listens to country music does not mean if somebody does not do that they are not okay i think that would be a good idea or you know culture is all different so if you wanted to view that as a culture or you ko not hey mean that that are something different um ecxcept the people you do not have to like what they are doing but they are still people so 

Recording: (2036/ 9620)

Recording: (2451/ 9620) 
well i agree that we should help them maybe through some sort of government program but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really does not motivate them to get out of the gutter i mean if they can make a living off of beging change off of college students they are probably going to stay with that because it is really easy life

i do not agree with that at all i think if your parents are unhappy together only think that is going ta happen is it is going to chuckle down and you are goin to have to listen to them being miserable and and i think it is much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that is miyserable and they fight and then you feel like it y you know people sayii my fault because thits happened you know and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger then i can not imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up i think that that would be probably very difficult um so i do not know that is a totally different perspective just to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger

Recording: (2468/ 9620) 
it it might um it might um i was going to say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campains i have seen ind recent years utilizing college ite students has been clinton is campaign bvoth tims u he knew he needed to get a base to increase um his chances of winning the election and did aspecially in the first campaign and an i belive that was ninety two did a really super job of organizing college students because that is when you are at youar moset um wh when you believe in things and you are at youre most idealistic and you would think thatyou know kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that um in addition to that and is an under curn it was not overt in the clinton campaign but i know when i talke to people um and you have to be careful where you do this because aborction is and at very thevice of issue in this cuntry and i think it does mobilize people but iuld also devihtes them you know defenitively almost like in vietnow almost like that war to vit at people um but i woul tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton because it wase the difference between protecting rovers is waight and not and in protecting choice you know um and i i am starting to see that now even in in the gor caimpaign the are i have seen a couple of editorials in the paper about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint to to three supreme court justice es and a that if you wane ta protect that right you hav got to vote with the candidate who is going to put the best justices on the supreme court and i got a lot of people to vte for clinton that way but both he ninty two an again in for your ninety six u and i think that is going nao happen again i because the the candidates and i am telling you my politics here very clearly and early but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that is you are redy i know which one will protect the right for choice um and um i i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i do not think it is an issue that if you did overtly and said you know support candidat ay over candidahte be because they will protect tabortion rightes thatis going ta thevide the country and not keep us together

Recording: (2543/ 9620) 
but they lived in a beautiful home i mean if you ware i mean kids like that i could see if they are in poore in harlom or whatever but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know i just think they were removed from what their children wher their son was doing

Recording: (2567/ 9620) 
well i think uh then my opinion i think main mainly the uh i it is the absenthe of uh basically parenting you know uh my mom was there uh she as a housewife you know han uh so she was she went to work after i think when i was a junior in high school you know and my brother ar allf my brothers and sistersare alrady graduated you know so 

Recording: (2568/ 9620) 
she went to my school she just barely works at all apparently 

Recording: (2569/ 9620) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (2570/ 9620) 
no really just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 

Recording: (2571/ 9620) 
ou know you have to be a good example i mean if you if you are just that for your kids then that is all they need you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you are taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right things and think that is the best you can do for 

Recording: (2572/ 9620) 
so he gives them a drug called well butran which is ah o know like an nid pressa type thing that they said works for uh eight chd but it really helped him you know concentrate to be able to study

<laugh> 

Recording: (2575/ 9620) 
but it made a lot of people more rare 

Recording: (2576/ 9620) 
well i think they need to do away with ta lot of the foster homes uh you know a lot of theyou know there is people with good intentions but i just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and uh you know may be pul these kids uh intoo more of a group seting or something and give them more um you know counceling uh professional you know counseling bis it uh you know li i did not have good experiences with foster homes and and i know uh a lot of kids you know that are saying that i think that the parents have too many rihts you know in the courts and there is just a lot going on you know that uhit is not going to get better it is going to get worse you know with the way families are torn a part now and uh you know mothers have o work and uh you just can not you know stay home and be that uh you know perfect mom you know so there s just a lot going on uh that needs to be restructured so 

Recording: (2577/ 9620) 
the 

Recording: (2578/ 9620) 
i mean obviously if someone is like thirty and the are gay i do not see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point inthe time 

Recording: (2579/ 9620) 
if you were not here well he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in uh twenty or twenty five years or something like that and he would killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed and i thought that is a cop out if there ever was one just to give him a leathal injection and let him go he should hav roted in prison for <laugh> no that is not a punishment he was off his rockr there is not anybody who murders who is not insane

well i i think that my opinion is that if you e not going to school and you are not going you are ot working and everything you should uh be doing something besides causing problems you know anda a lot of kids that is all they really want to do now adays is just cause aggravation of people 

Recording: (2600/ 9620)

and i think um of course we uld all hope that abortion would not be that that nobody would have an abbortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one um but i also think you know i i mean yeah there should not be there should not shuld not spend six weeks on abortion or six weeks on what to do if you are pregnant um but but i think the subject has to be mentioned just just in passing in health class maybe and thend and then there ought to u it ought to be it it should be known that you can go to your counseler 

Recording: (2603/ 9620)

Recording: (2610/ 9620) 
if you got a car it is easy to get there yeah but if you if you are riy n tha buss it sometimes uh takes a couple of hours 

Recording: (2611/ 9620)

Recording: (2617/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2618/ 9620) 
ah 

Recording: (2619/ 9620) 
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he you know so and so age an they sort of give backround on him and that is what everyone bases their view on it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what is going on when the media is only showing one start of the story i mean there is definitely much more out there that is going on than they are telling you u so i really do not see a big problem with the way the americ is going or whatever the uth um and like i would not say it is any worse than any past generations i mean other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because an past generations they were not around for it 

Recording: (2620/ 9620) 
yeah tha we did not really get the the video tape they gave us was half impamercials and then <laugh> thngs like things like how to clean the umbilico c i mean stuff like that but you you as far as actual parenting things went there was really not thing 

Recording: (2621/ 9620) 
yeah hi actually is his his dad is mother babysits 

Recording: (2622/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2623/ 9620) 
but the professor s seemore center centered to me they are like you have to balance it which i am sure is the truth you know you can not diminish all your bottom line for you know making your workers feel good but there is still something to it i think 

Recording: (2624/ 9620) 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing and um uh i think there is something else in the bible where you know she the he lady gives gives only a small portion compared to a large portion but in relation to what her income was thiat meant a lot more and that we need to get more involved than that we need to promote more of that if we are going to package things and materialize we need to think more of that but i think it ealy take home at night what would you beu doing if your third world country did not have a choice 

Recording: (2625/ 9620) 
i said this will never work i am not interested take it back and he said no oo kno just let us just work with us just work with us we will we will take care of this so i ended up saing to them for higred and forty four but it was just funny because i thought i thought they are never going to get to where i have to be and we are not even going no play this game back and forth 

Recording: (2626/ 9620) 
i thought it was stupid 

Recording: (2627/ 9620) 
um i mean obviously it is something that happens every day and things like that um like said by no means my saying yeah you go president clinton or anything like that but um i mean i can not say i would hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it is nothing that threatened the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2628/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (2629/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2630/ 9620) 
uh i think that 

Recording: (2631/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2632/ 9620) 
um um-hum yeah i guess migh i guess what i would say mostly for that is that the parents are too busy with their own carreers and they do not take time to raise their kids and establish the morals and the home and they are just like oh well they will learn it thereor whatever and the kids um they ire basic where they learn things as their peers they do not get t everything in stiled at home uh that is pretty much what you know i seeing talking to my husband and you know and theye irs so many broken homs and single moms and trying to to trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they are ready 

Recording: (2633/ 9620) 
i think there might be but i think most of them are dying breede they are the older citizens um many in my generation uh they it ul probably be because i am i am the early baby boom i am i am the first of the baby boom uh and that is when the woman is movement started and many men they are still having always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me when i talke to them and i talke to uh high school students ore even young college students um there there is a a whole world of difference between their attitudes and a lot of things and you know women is minority issues they is just second hand to them and it does not you know it is not like it was for us which was a seachange for them it is normal so and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote <laugh> you know you would have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did and ninety two ang get out that college vote 

Recording: (2634/ 9620)

i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attenntio and i think that is a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years so it it is been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother it is it is really he he nurchers him too so that is neat to watch 

Recording: (2813/ 9620)

Recording: (2821/ 9620) 
the opportunity to serve one another and uh that is the downfall of our society because we are thinking more of yourself it of others and i think as you as we become older you start thinking about how uh much your weknesses are but really your weeknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith it is not the materialistic things that the university here p uh professes to be the thing 

Recording: (2822/ 9620) 
i know and you know and the thing is you are going na have a a great time with your kids and it is just it is it is it is almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it is worth it

Recording: (2831/ 9620) 
yeah up on bassel road 

Recording: (2832/ 9620) 
if if you did not own let us say on a school levend you da i you pay taxese i always begetecause i rent and i always get very upset an i am very angry when people say well you do not have to pay school taxes yess i do because every time a school tax passes my rent goes up it is build into the rent uhat least it it aught to be ore i have a pretty dum landlord <laugh> uh and i wdo not i have never lived any place where my rent and did not go up after a school leviy passtd and usually in direct proportion and beyond you know uh of what the levie was uh so that would be the first thing i would say and then i would also say that you know uh because a a a a number of reasons that people do not vote for school levies now is because the do not have kids in the schools you know but education is the foundation uh a democracy and if you do not have an educated citizenry uh youre democracy could go down the drain uh that was why thommas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virgindia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you will not understand the issues you now but it is very difficult today to get to people um i have talk to som uh almost college aid students and they do not see the relationship you can talk a logic to them all you want and it is not like the logic gets to them yand you can talk history all you want and it does not mean anything to them and i do not know why i wish i did but i do not know why 

Recording: (2833/ 9620) 
i had considered that yes

Recording: (2838/ 9620) 
yeah well there is too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones just every one of them is different 

Recording: (2839/ 9620) 
what is different i my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so from that angle it was i mean stills my elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it is there a block away oland tene ville i am right in where i always was i mean i am i was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now so i made a full circle there but collumbus has changed in the downtown area and it is really neat you know compared to any other citie s of course i am i loved oregon i was very rural for eighteen years 

Recording: (2840/ 9620) 
yoh um-hum 

Recording: (2841/ 9620) 
it is in in education it is it is top they preduce a lot of graduate and undergraduate uh education bs ine schools coming up lik they are building a new building but by i will be gone by the time it is non if i decide to stay so it is it will be so as far as uh education like for a small school and they just open up with their pghd program and education and they are also knowing for political science but it is a real conservative political science andike it is a real conservative school and that does not really match my my views on a lot of things uh like they it is dry they have uh real strict visitation policyies things like that and my thought is if you are inif you are if you are considere an adult enough to move away then you should not have that many restrictions i can understand some because i remember whan i was a freshman in colleges we did crazy things but still

made you well aware of 

Recording: (2844/ 9620) 
i think that i do not think that divorce is a bad thing i think that i it is if you are married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are are not in a positive relationship for each other where for anybody else in your family that it is better to just say l this is not working we both diserve to be happy and we and and and go your own separate ways um i think that i i think for me personally i would certainly i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i would not end up getting divorced just because i think it makes things a little bit more deficult as far as like comordinating things and i know that sounds kind of petty but just u i i i i mean i do not think it is i do not think it is bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to mak a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different

Recording: (2942/ 9620)

Recording: (2943/ 9620) 
so that is that is frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates hand you think i do not want either one of these people there should be a none of the above you know if there is at that option i am sure a lot more 

Recording: (2944/ 9620)

Recording: (2949/ 9620) 
so 

Recording: (2950/ 9620) 
tats 

Recording: (2951/ 9620) 
sa i almost bought one um a lk couple of weeks ago in fact i i went into contract on it with this guythis dear old man who is it was for his mother who was in her nineties and a retiremet n it was on royal forest which is north and i made this the slow offer and i never thought that they would i did not want it was kind of like i f like i had to do this because i if i was going to get this house i should get it but i did not really want now because i a the baby coming and weare gong to be busy and i did not want ta get involved in and so i made this offer and thin he countered back you know i offered him ninety two and he was asking ninety nine nine so he counterd back an nine ty six and i said you know i thougt w gold o have towory about it he is never going to come to it so i wrote back and said you know i appreciat r ofver but ninety two i ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two if ive was really f the only thing i could i could do and i did not even give him the time e to respond because i just jussumed i was just bowing out of it 

Recording: (2952/ 9620) 
um i think it is probably some of both i think it is probably more social but i mean obviously they are going to have different views on how things work um but i mean for the most part i can not see that iis being too big of a problem um obviously there are more like violent guys out there in things like that than there are women but at the same time i would not say there is anything too overpowerful as far as the number of guys being out there they are violent i mean it is something an it unfortunately does happen but i mean it is more how you are brought up whether you can control it or not 

Recording: (2953/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (2954/ 9620) 
oh that is almost as bad as rosy cozy i have a

yah 

Recording: (2958/ 9620) 
um and you kind of knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that is still that is still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in um so i do not think i me personally other than other than the fact that maybe there is a couple more things to do there is bigger more comfortable movie theaters and and that kind of stuff at it has not really 

Recording: (2959/ 9620) 
o usually she is looking for something to eat you know 

Recording: (2960/ 9620) 
sometimes i think it is been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it is been very good because at least let is us know what is going on in the rest of the world and if it were not for that some of the things we would not know and i think that if you increase your knowlege you are far better off htha to stay in this little hole over here and this is all i want to know about 

Recording: (2961/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (2962/ 9620)

Recording: (3043/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (3044/ 9620) 
i i think it is because uh u when i i was a sothemore in high school before it daugned on me that tabe and slotb anny relation to this stuff that we were learning with the charts in the diagrams and um but i think kids are a lot more aware now from because of what they are exposed to you know in movies and everything you know just tv just daily life um i they are a lot more aware they they have i i they they go into it with a lot of u uh miths and misapprehentions but they definitely have thoughts about it and and i think they i think they need to know 

Recording: (3045/ 9620) 
yeah like when i need things and i call them up i kneed dipers hunywipes ined twenty dollars yeah he is there for me for that financially uh he is always been there for me

yeah it is well basically it is like ah it is about the size of a very small hotell room and then it is got a stufpe bathroom with like a big bathtub and there is like they is li o it the room ith theripy which is a little box on the while about tit is bige that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it but i mean there is anough rom where people can come and sit down there is like a fold out couch bed for whoever is in there with you and then they have got the baby they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it is born 

Recording: (3049/ 9620) 
it was during school um you would go there you went there for two years youara junior and senior year and um like your junior yo oul go in the morning and you are senior yould go in the afternoon but it took up pretty much your whole day half of your day actually you are at the cur centerd hand you go

Recording: (3051/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (3052/ 9620) 
just because you know it was more like they seem like they wanted to be there as opposed to i am just doing this because i do not know why or whatever and it seems like too they they i hate it when people it is obvious that if they did not have the textbook they would not know how to do it you know like wheare if people did not have their otkno itis like they would not be able to do it themselves you know it is kind of like um and so i think it it is when people have real enthusiasm and like you know or and put a lot of effort into making it not the same every day and not just like a lecture and whend then we do home work enturnitay and like you know it is like we do like like an history class we do like rol role playing things and like

Recording: (3099/ 9620) 
now like i tol heri she whay i was raisedwen 

Recording: (3100/ 9620) 
that is that is yeah at is developmental because by the did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that is when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant but now they hve found out that the full dominance does not take over until about eaige eight 

Recording: (3101/ 9620) 
uhum 

Recording: (3102/ 9620) 
that is a big growing period you know from junior high to high school was when you really learn and try to decide what you want ao do with your life um my mother was always home she was um which was good to come home to because i had friends whose parent mothers were not there and they had to cleand they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they feeld that they kind of missed out on things um but i think you know kids a lot of them who have when they parents have money and um both parents worked i am not sure if the combine if both parents worked but i do not think just the mother being home there would have totally helped no 

Recording: (3103/ 9620) 
yes 

Recording: (3104/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3105/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (3106/ 9620) 
but uh her mother stayed with us foror several uh two or three years and she was a baby setter for her oldest boy 

Recording: (3107/ 9620) 
and it really is not though because won because i think it is actually it is really freeing not to have to drink and all these things so you just kind of i feel like i can get along with any people and so it does not really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it i guess and nobody is perfect i mean everybody has er prejudices i guess and fears so getting over that is a is part of life <laugh> for everyone 

Recording: (3108/ 9620) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3109/ 9620) 
yeah yeah i saw that patient in the morning 

Recording: (3110/ 9620)

Recording: (3111/ 9620) 
i know it is connected to like you know england because it is i i guess that is i guess uh i maybe like england owned it once so tha 

Recording: (3112/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (3113/ 9620) 
and uh it did not hurt ma not you know uh i think it just depends upon like i said a lot of factors you knows your neighborhood your neighbors uh most kids do not have nothing to do in their neighborhood even you know how many empty lots do you see now adays it still comes back to like when i was a kid we had go carts we had many bikes we had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3114/ 9620) 
there is a lot more in college college it is seven nights a week 

Recording: (3115/ 9620) 
um-hum and some conservative values too you know that the republicans are supposed to represent but i do not think they they are doing a very good job othat <laugh> 

Recording: (3116/ 9620) 
a it is not a presidential issue canidit issue as far as i am concerned but uh i am 

Recording: (3117/ 9620) 
would not have even stoped he said nd the ar going what dare you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested me and he took my neckless tried to take my radio too and uh you know i kind of through that in there and make it sound bad but <laugh> i was on my way to work i man i did not want anything bad to happen to me or him you know so all in all the cop you know put the guy and handcoughs putthing back he car youcause well do you want to press charges and at that time i was a little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let him out of the car i will beet his ass uh an e cob said somethng o i od never forget he said i would but that probably have to bea my job to do if we was living like that i was like god and ridn e king all over again not 

Recording: (3118/ 9620) 
i do not see any reason for it myself but uh that is interesting uh uh you know when they when the first when the uh when time began you knowa quarter tom my uh what i believe in and everything you know it was man and woman got married you know and and reason they got married ist because of procureation youknow keep the keep the uh population going uh i think that is the way it was set up originally so i hade no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman but uh if if that was the relationship for everybody 

Recording: (3119/ 9620) 
motherly instinct towards you knowo and they are like old aric yoeu should have one and you know and he knows o cnve one um i just knew at a young age i have always loved the animals

see and i can not eat seafood but i tried some once when i went to losvegus with my dad and i we did not really have it my mom did not cook it at home which i am kind of glad she did antd um the smell fish always kind of bothered me but until i ud tried some crab meat and lobster and within five minutes i broke out an to a rash i mean it was like a heat rash it started on my neck 

Recording: (3122/ 9620) 
you know so i figure it is it is much better to be nice to them because there is also times when you know everybody makes errors and you know maybe one of these times and you make an eir and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh you know like there is an air plane over ther and i tll you to turn that way and i really ment for you to turn left instead of right and you may come baut and go ud do you do you mean left or right there and i go yes it is correct turn left you know yoak so you know everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kind nus goes a long way and the pilot is the same way theyr most often they are you know pretty decent 

Recording: (3123/ 9620) 
well i use 

Recording: (3124/ 9620) 
oh yeah 

Recording: (3125/ 9620) 
yeah uh a it is to to me that is sort of a slap on the rist and you tell the parents what you have done it that the kid did and you do not want them to do it again and let it go they suspended it i do not know of course memer pobably say this i got this version of this story from the collumbus dispatch so it is probably not ther whole story yeah <laugh> it is 

Recording: (3126/ 9620)

like do not have one at home because we are worried if that 

Recording: (3128/ 9620)

Recording: (3129/ 9620) 
oh 

Recording: (3130/ 9620)

Recording: (3134/ 9620) 
which i feel has been com like completely devoicet in america because of the effects of the cold war u i have inherited of this world where there ere uh uh uh harm ik going with this <laugh> um i mean the generation before is had like ve um he protestedd against it and i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before buti mean when it came down to it i mean the what was the protest really about you know and i am not being clear becas i am not gus iaclly sure where i am going thi i am very cynical of uh about about the world i have inherited uhbecause i see a world in which my political views have been silente by fifty years of uof you know like international politics uh i in sort of lik propaganda um that i says you know like to be left of a certain point is bout u like among conservative cercles the word liberal is is like almost like colling so in a communist in in the forties um where as i am very cynical about that because e they feel thatt it was not it it it is been a cultural process that has been developped and now i am being handed this current situation which i e see as completely unfair i mean i think the reason that our generation is sy cinical no the reason i am cinical is because we are handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past or not the the the hipocracy i mean i guess in justice id also applis and terams of things like the cold war and stuff it that is why i am cinical i hope that answers your question at least a little bit in kn not kno i feel kind of pret like this is my position

Recording: (3178/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (3179/ 9620) 
well i do not think they should be respons abut i think um kids go to school and they need reoal models good teachers um you know i think schools have gotten a lot abhetter about that it seem lik ind the laghteeighties arlly nineties you know the schools lot of them are really bat um i think finally bh education department or whatever realizing that parents need help whath their kids they can not do everything and you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school and you know i think teachers are a big part of it i really do you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you have learned a lot uand i think you know through education because it is hard all these schools and so many rural wearers and everty thing try to get good teachers and then you know it is ory is hat to do with money and the am not ymaking enough money whic is the teachers do not make enough money and they are overwork thand all these big large classrooms and it jus seems to me when i kids start dressing in getting in a clleck together you know itoud be hard for them to in are being in say what is going on ind your life whic s your what st the problen you know that is that is not really should be their rol but um an if they care enough they should call the parents and they look wore worried about your son you kmniss is a lot school or he tarting ta dress really you know i sometimes and it should not be that dress has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids go a different way a it does involve dress and just you know turning again then nor of the soeciety you know and if theydonot ant to be in sports that is fine there is so many different things that they can do in in school and a earn about earts and music and you know but um unfortunatly a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools so more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can not do hun itis some ways it is always kind of been like that i mean in wat is like you went to school and they took care of mou until you got home you know i mean 

Recording: (3180/ 9620)

um-hum 

Recording: (3182/ 9620) 
and it is like i i like how i hickt i thought about going to antiock but it was it was really expensive and like um i do not know but just because it that ind in schools more of uh nontraditional uh typewheare they give you like a valuations and you do not get grades like and so so then it that is what i that i what i heard it is like in anniock where the professor rites uh like a couple f page paper on your like performance on the quarter and that that really shows that imean that is a lot of work for the professor but like that really shows that he is really involved and noticing what you are doing as opposed to just like uh some kid in his class you know 

Recording: (3183/ 9620)

Recording: (3254/ 9620) 
i do not know uh maybe i think i me if teachers just their status in society is not real high when it should be um it is more likei you i have heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and how but it so it is just like people always talk about you know education for the you know we got i like think about our childis feather or whatever but really teachers ore paid crap and like do not really get a lot of respect from anybody like professors and stuff get gt like more of a respect but ink it is just like tea like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in in your life like inorow like especially in out of lessons too like really influence like how you ares a pers and in like people do not like take that for granted a lot like if you have bad teachers in one subjectyo aregon to hate that subject you know and like if you have good teachers you are gong ao love it i mean theyare relly in influences too like how like what you want to do with your life you know and people do not really achknowlege that too much

that is that is really hard to say um if she was a younger woman and ran the campain that she ran negatives do not work in columbus columbus really does have a heart and that just does not play an columbus what plays in the state and tand the people who ran her campaign wan voin of it his campaign and betthih myn gummeri is campaign and and that negative stuff worked state wad ant does not work so well in columbus u i i think i it even i younger woman who wran that particular campaign would have lost um and i like to think that age does not matter but she came across as old to me also and i like to think i am not prejuticed on on any issue but if there as a someone who had been wright on the issues i do not care she was old i would have voted for she just did not support the issues i supported she was wrong on uh i i did not like that she trid to use um the police chief in such a negative way by saying that u coman had voted for a raise for the chiefe well yes he voted for a raise for a chief but he voted for a raise for the the police officers it is just that you know the police chief was tied to his and i do not like people who tried to manipulate facts um and and that was manipulating the facts i did not like that she was u uh a against the the the tiff um an colerous once it was voted i thought i was more important whether it was wright or wrong and i do not think it was wrong to begin with but once it was voted and implace i thought her reputation was on the line and for her to try to use a nother to vice of issue just to get elected did not sit well with me um so i do not even if she had a lot of corisma corismat does not mean as much to me as a person stand

Recording: (3492/ 9620) 
<laugh> u i to sounn like a broken record but i really think it is are u bakslide on onfamily unnits i think it is too easy thi tay i and i have been married in divorced so i have unfortunately have that experience to me um but it is too easy to get divorced u people do not really go into marriage with commit mhat and lifetime and have that i do not want to say old fasiond vaus but just thea vow you this is a very important u because let us face it to me love is a choice because there is times when i do not love my husband i want ta smack him and he is being a littmle berny but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then not passes i an lon be whold of an hour later week later whar hav whatever long it takes i am in love with him again i mean really you know whan i am saying and um i think it is just too easy to get divorced i do not believe in staying into marriage for the sake of children but i think if you really make that commitmint and actually work on it you can have a great reallationship you can have kids and bring them up in i more stable environment um i unfortunately i think thats the problem parents u ore ay eithey are getting divorced and then they get caught up and the are petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other you know using the kid as a medium um or they are too selfish and do not listen to their kids or they did not i i do not want to say selfishe but let us face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your your your schedual and u i not spend enough time with the kids you know they are work en wheting on it and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them iand let them grow and things like that um and i do not think ienough families are doing that

<laugh> 

Recording: (3760/ 9620) 
well i uh westerville yeah so that is difficult for us to deal with 

Recording: (3761/ 9620) 
uhum 

Recording: (3762/ 9620) 
hat is where we are in our evolution on that 

Recording: (3763/ 9620) 
well h definitely it just happeng to me when i was nio a third grery dun a pien o or two of our friends were uh uh whent hothem afte school you ware paying with a gun and everything and and uh one of them shot and killd the other one you know accidentally uh it just goes to you know my dad always had a gun eetnt did not have in locked up forhe tinim but you know it was not ne sariland tha saying place all the tomethin you or you know i mean so if you were not really looking for it you know you appe to happend stay not just happen staysonto b it or something you know u uh i believe now days you know that perhaps with the uh with e the guns you know availability of pe in mor people hpthen guns that do nthn kno do not should not hapthem apparentely uh you know they should be uh lot undher lock an ke uh you asked for the you know the parents somebody is responsible fort you know but see then you get into catch twenty two because of the legislation and i mean you can not require i do not see how you can require a uh the guy who buy is a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe por of the for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that in the case of a burgler comes into your house which is why why you have a gun anyway you have some peer or something like that happen ing other ways you should not have one unlss you ar sportsman hand uh then you know your t is not goint be worsth it to have the gun in the first place so 

Recording: (3764/ 9620) 
so i pretty much um it is not stressful ad or u i it is really easy it is not challenging 

Recording: (3765/ 9620) 
yeah he is yeah he is twenty six

Recording: (3791/ 9620)

Recording: (3802/ 9620) 
yeah you can not say a nown is always going to be orange and it is going to be slippery you know i mean language is so much more abstract than mathan science so the abstract areas like history and english and reading and literature that is where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages they either can not rite can not read can not spell can not do all three or are not very good at any of them once in a while you will see a good speller because he can remember the order in which the letters come but he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell you know in his comprehention of the words of other kids his age wuld an be what it should be generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 

Recording: (3803/ 9620) 
umhumit is 

Recording: (3804/ 9620) 
wel i did not really start out as a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist but they kept giving me these kids that i could not keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them so i got interested in the hiper activity and so i started taking classes about ou know kids with eight achd and stuff and little by little for cno i had my masteris ind learning disabilities andt was mostly just so i could learn how to keep the kids in their seeat long enough to do the speech theropy then when i found out there was so many openings and special ed so and then i found out later that speech theiropy as a very good background for lld because a lot of these lld kids have language deficits in language problems they they can not you know like express themselves on paper where they do not eep process things correctly auditorially so that is the perfect background to work with elld kids i did not know i was doing that at the time but 

Recording: (3805/ 9620)

<laugh> 

Recording: (3947/ 9620) 
she was but i admired her more <laugh> because um uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again that is going to be the litmus test it wis just like back in in the sixties in the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party they would nominate such people as um macgovern who had you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning over the years i have moderated my hard line left of center libral stance for more of a modert middle of the road because it is easier to get that sold to the american public um so while i think doll was correct um i think yeah she shot herself on the foot i do not he would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is being controled by the extreme right wing which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to moved towards the middle which i think georgia dubia is trying to do um uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell he i tell tham yes and i am an in um an indifferent liberal 

Recording: (3948/ 9620)

i do not think fourcing prair on somebody if they do not believe in it i do not think that is the right thing to do but 

Recording: (3956/ 9620)

issues so um you know that is one thing that that i hope that they they work on 

Recording: (4017/ 9620) 
well it would have been something that they would have supported and something that i would have probably been pretty good at 

Recording: (4018/ 9620) 
uhhum 

Recording: (4019/ 9620) 
what is bad about where i work at it is it is not so much ras istem as whereas if you are my superviser i am just using it as an example and i do something wrong 

Recording: (4020/ 9620) 
she read my notes and all that 

Recording: (4021/ 9620) 
so i made a lot of stupid you know you look back and you see things you were like this is real obvious but at the time i think youthh i was like um ay i can either change them or if they love me we can communicate and change things and you know that type of thing 

Recording: (4022/ 9620) 
nd then you come here you know what i mean you see people stand out on th street corners with signs work for food 

Recording: (4023/ 9620) 
oh yeah i think it is possible it would have to take the right combination of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nommination and appeal to the people i think dol would have been a good candidate i would have been hart pressed i mean some of her issues i do not like but when she came out uh and said her her her famous thing on the abbortion issue when she came out against guns uh she went up in couple of notches in in in my estimation because i was not sure where she would be i thought she would have to sell herself as hardlined with a hardline republicans and then i would not have been able to vote for her 

Recording: (4024/ 9620) 
and and she is very determined uh she has said that having this being pregnant and having this baby is made her focus on things a lot differently she ays she does not want to go back to being the way she was before she does not want to go back to the the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 

Recording: (4025/ 9620) 
a great guy but he certo liked to get drunk you know and the problem was he wauld turn into such a jirk

Recording: (4028/ 9620)

Recording: (4029/ 9620) 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that is what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good day care because theyt work all these wild shifts and stuff so that is how it first started before you was not even on campus it was over on like fourth or sumbit in a church when it first started but you know it is just not you know people were always saying i can not believe how much you pay for day care and i am like but look what we are getting you know people take their kids to somebody is neighbor is house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and 

Recording: (4030/ 9620)

Recording: (4033/ 9620) 
oh i see wellthat wold be a good way i would think 

Recording: (4034/ 9620) 
<laugh> whole lot more places to live it seems like everywhere i turn there is construction and and you know you go down n one road and then you wait a couple of years if you do not go in that area and it is all changed it looks all different so and that is mainly like looking up bethel and three fifteen or things like that

Recording: (4038/ 9620) 
right and then they wonder why you know i do not know what is happened it is the other person who is changed you know and if you if you start changing your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way that will go and roal thing if you if you give out what you want back you get it

yeah exactly so you know once you once you get to a certain degree of uh frustration you need to relieve that somehow so that is pretty much why we moved 

Recording: (4194/ 9620) 
i have always thought that it it ends up being a personal decision 

Recording: (4195/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (4196/ 9620) 
right 

Recording: (4197/ 9620)

those are the god old days that is a go days that is when you used to own them too you cauld trade them that that iswhen we lost our rihts <laugh> there is some things there re traditional there are capital t and some are lowte lowcasete and you are talking about lowt kasete i am talking about capital tee 

Recording: (4205/ 9620) 
bye 

Recording: (4206/ 9620) 
i was going to then relate to a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh ut butnd that was one comment yheu war talking about but then on the very very opposite exxtreme uh extreme opposite wee talk about the love woth the child from the day of birth and this may seem to be contradictory and i am not quite sure how to address that because you know ia some people would say now we ment you are talking out about bot sides your mouth expression is how can you say over hear you must have the love of this child in your arms and and then over hear you are saying you believe ing capital punishment and electriccution 

Recording: (4207/ 9620) 
i think example is probably the best um they see that you care and they learned to care i think my son jon he is the youngest i think he is a very compastionate soal u very spiritual young man um more so than his brother is and then i always hav have to waiy that you know they say that sometimes you give because it makes you you feel better to give and i sometimes try ta way that if that is part of why i i i can not believe it is an attention getter because there is nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do but um but maybe just within maybe one feels u and i think i think it it is a matter of being concientious to you know concientious that there are 

Recording: (4208/ 9620) 
no 

Recording: (4209/ 9620) 
it is quite possible but we picked the day care that i thought was closest to on the one that was open that had the closest bause that we had um i personally would like a church base program but there are not any there were not any open when we were looking for one um we did have the option ouh going here owas shoe to their day care and it has a wonderful reputation and everybody that i have talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program but what i did not like was so that they were not um in parting values on the children bhey do not selebrate any holidays at all so they just kind of ignore everything where he is now i still like getting my mother is day card and i mean they are doing turker treatthing on thurstday they are going door to dor they get a dress up where he would not have gotten any of that ad i wase and they are prosind cons to to both of those but

um-hum yeah it is supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (4586/ 9620) 
i think more of what they need to do is in strict or uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shooting and things like that um because i mean for the most part i mean people really do not get too badly punished for things i mean if you look in other countries i mean like people like the asian countries places like that i mean iise really strict laws i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism yoursel serving jail time and you get you get pretty badly punished for it i mean i some cases it will even chain you up in beatchan public for it u and i think not just sound too aventual but i think if more things went that way that there would be a much less problem with tat um i think just the fact the the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they are going to get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff that if you shoot someone you aren you are not even going no get thirty days in jail and you are going to be like go i mean that is an awfully small price to pay for

Recording: (4717/ 9620) 
oyah 

Recording: (4718/ 9620) 
during school but at the same time i mean as long as the parents love the kids it does not really matter what sex they are and they treat them well uh so i mean that is kind of a tough question to answer i mean it is almost it is something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they would be adopting them they obviously w know how to answer that question yeah 

Recording: (4719/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (4720/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (4721/ 9620) 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 

Recording: (4722/ 9620) 
yeah yeah yeah she probably got um i do not know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money but it would not have been enough welfare wise to get a car and a 

Recording: (4723/ 9620) 
but it is min bogelling that it is because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you are talking two whole high school two football teams you know it is just min bogeling all these people you know you graduate with you know and know a handfull of people and do not know anybody else b like you know a lot more of a tightnit group as a child so we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 

Recording: (4724/ 9620) 
because concievably they wanted what was it a two dollar raise or something but and then they also get free tuition but only as i understand it only a very small percentage get that free tuition or like 

Recording: (4725/ 9620) 
well but see i think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that you know you should sex is something that should be between two people that love each other and unless you really feel love and really think it is love than you know you should not do it 

Recording: (4726/ 9620) 
well let me ask you uh about somebody else who is not that well known do you know jon gorka have you heard of him he is really worth looking into he is he is funnyhe has good songs he is a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh maybe arlow guthre or somebody i mean he he does electric stuff sometimes but he also does a coostick and um he writes most of his own songs yeah and if you ever see something buy him you should get it or if you see it in a friend is collection ask to listen to it he has funny funny some of the songs that ae really funny and some of them are the saddest things thou have ever heard yeah yeah just just tragic things <laugh> um let us see fny ones are examples of funny ones are winter cows <laugh> um let us see uh i can not think too much of them right now bu uh yeah 

Recording: (4727/ 9620) 
but just that freedom you know to do what you want to get some sleep to eat to take care of yourself to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not and then it is really clear but if you do not get that and you are always thrust back into it i do not think you can break free

Recording: (4765/ 9620) 
you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so i really do not know how to how how they would go about doing that perhaps like i know we used to have like uh we had like the administrators actually lot us to have uh a day where w everyone like the whole class as a class could go have a pickhnic tlike getting the practice foot ball filld ano it was cool because everyone got along those days because you did not have to go tha class you know ousd ben than it is second ot have or the day just hanging outnd so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start you know but then that hurts the the the administrators in the sense that they are there to provide an education so it would be rough and like my high school they they put up cameras and they had like they locked basthroom like at certain times you could not go in um and like it was getteng and they had like we are on the front page of the accambicon journal because they had a lock down where no one was a lot to leav their classroom and then they brought the the dogs through and they found i was surprised they found a lot of drugs 

Recording: (4766/ 9620) 
they are prevented from doing much yeah yeah i yeah i just do not think that they can do much and i a am i am sure it is very frustrating for them well n and i know it is i we had a friend whois was a teacher she just retired a couple of yars ago i abut our age and uh it s it is very different now uh you know it is she said it is scary going into the classroom sometimes uh and before it was not that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a you know go and get something det with it now you can not get back i kon it

right right well it is sort of a problem as well that you know thos i mean it seems you know from what i have read if you wanted to make a bomb it is fairly u uncomplicated you know so thts 

Recording: (5000/ 9620) 
that is right in other words it is so much me any more instead of us and wee 

Recording: (5001/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (5002/ 9620) 
yeah it does nt it is not like a skilled profession to me i think 

Recording: (5003/ 9620) 
t i see that is because i do not think americans travel as much as as like the the europeans do i think i guess because europeans they have like more i guess public transportation accessible they get the change that they eurol change than the buses and and and and just like the frst but just by personal car you can go you know accross just going across the border yo thiy cant they can go visit uh you know countries like like it is so condense but heare it is like we got or ocians and it is like we got of like fly so so i i think that is why i like i think a europeans aare more a are much more cooler in that respect tho they are much more cosmopolitan just because a they they they it is like it is no big deal for the for like somebody in europe to speak like suven languagees wegh here it is like you know ho get somebody over here h who can actually who actually knows english <laugh> <laugh> you knowit is like so that that is i think that is i think that is what i will find hopefully hopefully

not so much old star track uh i like deep space nine of the new ones um i mean i back when it was new i like the next generation but when sdeep space nine came out and it had a gridier darcer story that was not so cookiy cutter in fasion there wast uh a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development it was not like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad bthe the characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama so i like that do not like voyager so much i i see that it when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it as something that would be even gridier i they had the potential for for excellent inter character conflict but they glossed over all those immediately was in ther first season um and that really bothered me ian it ultimately thi story ik they are traped but they do not really persue like the issues of being separated from home and two factions that had 

Recording: (5011/ 9620) 
they settled in springfild ohio and then my mom met my father um he was from patasca a they met here rat o issue where they were going to college and they settled here in columbus

Recording: (5192/ 9620) 
i uh well that is a that is a tough one uh i remember you know when we were we had you know some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know we are it was you pretty much knew it was off thake anyway you know but seaned to me that is a take and uh uh and i y neve mber really thought about it while i was growing up i it was what was real and everything you knw i always knew that by i there again you know bout my dad being a hunter rnd everyhing you know i knew it when your shot something bhat it died it was not a it was not a game you know uh and i would hate to think that that would caused some kid to go off as arocker and shoot something bode yeas sho od an nother human being i mean it does not i do not even know why there should be any concern for it i guess i on as so 

Recording: (5193/ 9620)

Recording: (5194/ 9620) 
well i do not think that women should belin the front lines uh some women are are physically able to do what is needed some definitely are not of course tar is a sayime by the same token some men are not but uh i a support groupso i think that is all right 

Recording: (5195/ 9620) 
yeah i meanhe 

Recording: (5196/ 9620) 
she is very bright she is very she comes from a extremely disfunctional family her uh parent is divorced wen she is about four her mother isan alcoholicke her father said that he would take her with him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind so she is pretty much raised herself t it is a big it it is terrible things but she is d to go through and she is made it very clear that she will not live within alcoholick and that is helped straighten him out so and our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the the drugs was not the problem and we have dealt with several counselers and that tis all they wanted to deal with our problem his always been it is a symptom uh took the sychologist a year and a half but he finally a charly is he is very intuitive and t even as a totler he could do this he he seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him 

Recording: (5197/ 9620) 
it was real close to my home 

Recording: (5198/ 9620)

Recording: (5202/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5203/ 9620)

Recording: (5230/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (5231/ 9620)

hit the mark sometime so he gets to clean the toylet especially since most of that is his 

Recording: (5420/ 9620) 
anything else is a hard weare failir a you woud have to goo fix it somewhere else anyway so if you know ow to put an operting system on your machine you can start over if you can start over there is no reason to be scared of anything that you do problem number one in playing with computers for most people as being afraid that they are going to break something 

Recording: (5421/ 9620) 
well i believe me i know 

Recording: (5422/ 9620) 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with hit for a long time which you know i am sure she did i do not know i always thought um i always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have if you do not pay a speeding ticket there is a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

Recording: (5423/ 9620) 
like oh from mormans well our basic um real fundamental belief is that tha church that the russians believed in at one time was the true church and tha it was um the the same church that christ set up when he was on the earth with the twelve appossals and but after christ died that the authority was taken from the earth to u have those apossals and to have the the church set up like it was and it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same cathlic and or all the orthodox church still carried all these beliefs 

Recording: (5424/ 9620) 
um no children so it was quite easy for us 

Recording: (5425/ 9620) 
yeah not not for special conditions nothing just universally it is wrong 

Recording: (5426/ 9620) 
oh i think i would do it in a minute but my family does not want it the my husband thinks we are fine he does not want anymore around and all my kids are so used to all their own 

Recording: (5427/ 9620) 
and until that consumer becomes on the equa knowlege level as the mark uh it is always going ta be inequible and you are going to have a problem in our society because we do not need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age it becomes a liability but then the diveloper thing well let us see whell hetl we can make condo s downside letbt o stl we want t ak this we want to make this margin of profit yeah we do el what about for society is best interests 

Recording: (5428/ 9620) 
yeah that is true that is a pretty good analogy

and and that is what a lot of people ware telling me you know just you know life is a struggle 

Recording: (5497/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5498/ 9620) 
it it was not easy in at first it was probably a lot harder than after you have been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things but i i took for granted coming to am coming back here it was 

Recording: (5499/ 9620) 
ecause you know the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and leather games and you know at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer as all education stuff it is not game game it it has a game theam to it but 

Recording: (5500/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (5501/ 9620) 
i think that uh it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york 

Recording: (5502/ 9620) 
boy it would have to be um something that i actually enjoy um what happened was ever since i came to collumbus almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state and i was not interested in that uh because my husband works for the state it i obviously he is not going anywhere um so i got tired of that and that is why i kind of went to dumping and stuff so it would be one with ah variety um i am unfortunately i say unfortunately good at a accounting and stuff but that does not get to express my chreative side as much so it would be um my favorite job was one where i did the accounty but i dealt with people as well and like we would do presentations at some on ours and stuff like that occasionally too so right 

Recording: (5503/ 9620) 
and it is you know my mom you know she always sa wll what is you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things so i think i think it is kind of neat that i have been involved in a lot of a lot of the other kids that way 

Recording: (5504/ 9620) 
at our desk we had terminals that connected to a system 

Recording: (5505/ 9620) 
now i just like it anyway and i like their culture a lot 

Recording: (5506/ 9620) 
fruit loops yeah and it is like what is the difference you know besides the price 

Recording: (5507/ 9620) 
but there are those that are out there that are willing to do that 

Recording: (5508/ 9620) 
you know they should not knw where the kees are if theye were kees to the gun cabinete or whatever i mean the fact that you know how wdo you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school 

Recording: (5509/ 9620) 
which was scheduled in the evenings when i was working and i could not even go to therapy 

Recording: (5510/ 9620)

Recording: (5511/ 9620) 
arklis is probably the closest place 

Recording: (5512/ 9620) 
oh okay <laugh> 

Recording: (5513/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5514/ 9620) 
my boy friend would love to mess with this i just wantes you to know he would be liking he takeng it apart pitting him back together 

Recording: (5515/ 9620) 
according to that and so i can not think what some of their observations were but there is usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5516/ 9620) 
she that is a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much you know 

Recording: (5517/ 9620) 
they go she is got it and they ar gong to the next guy and then all of a sud den you are going aoff this wone they go uh s that s nice juliet uh where are you going and you are like uh oh you told me to and then they go oh berother you know so now you know attention is diverted to you so that is usually what the problem is because most pilots are there real professional yeah a 

Recording: (5518/ 9620) 
i have given you plenty of opinions have not i i have just loaded them on okay i i just have a question is do you is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5519/ 9620) 
you know my parents never did because um they knew i was always levelheaded i always had a lot of boyfriends you know but i always i always felt like i was waiting for the right one 

Recording: (5520/ 9620) 
is that right 

Recording: (5521/ 9620) 
i mean instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5522/ 9620) 
um 

Recording: (5523/ 9620) 
uhu 

Recording: (5524/ 9620) 
like i said i have been here twenty five years i have seen a lot of weird stuff th fact is when i was a bigger i hav seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 

Recording: (5525/ 9620) 
from the day one 

Recording: (5526/ 9620) 
yoes to but that more that has primarily because of necessity uh more often than not uh maybe even today tit is less than that because it is been a because of ta loss of a parent orr inability of a parent uh or parents uh being able to handle those children so yes those things do exist and they will always have some but that is a very small percentage thout is got 

Recording: (5527/ 9620) 
t dos not matter how much money they are given for their education they 

Recording: (5528/ 9620) 
when you think that our major resource is is our children and our offspring then we better not you know 

Recording: (5529/ 9620) 
uh we are plano moving in the spring 

Recording: (5530/ 9620) 
well number one it is a little bit smaller more controled area quiet no less and uh get my mom closer to ha sister you know my sister lives up here she moved there from uh down in west virginia so you know with mom having all the peace peace and quiet she wants you know plus in a place that is only year old 

Recording: (5531/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (5532/ 9620) 
um just to get into the school there is about thirty people applying they let three in 

Recording: (5533/ 9620) 
yeah that could be ro yeah 

Recording: (5534/ 9620) 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again ad it is just like the people when i worked in bars they would always want to hold the bar tender responsible but sa you could come up i give you a bear and you could give it to somebody else 

Recording: (5535/ 9620) 
all the chool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything so that is where i lived 

Recording: (5536/ 9620) 
m 

Recording: (5537/ 9620) 
um well actually it is sort of all happening and a certain area you know with you know very high unemployment like councel council states um you know this sort of sterio type you know kind of bad family environment you know parents have loads of boy friends and girl friends drugs everything else and you know a lot of these girls thati have been interviewed you know say oh you know i wanted onthing to love or you know we were bord so we decided to have sex and i mean i h find et just totally appalling and you know a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed wish sayng oh you know he wl you knw slept with like t ten girls or something i am thinking oh my god sho know ind these thirteen and you know had a few kids and that was it but an my opiniond the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have they you know they get unemployment because once they have had a kidty even if they are not of workeu k age they get like a and a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think um fifteen or sixteen if they have a baby theire provide theire the top of the list for a counsiel house so they get theire own there was actually a long dacument her ond before i left um you know of this girl who as constantly fighting with her parents and you knw r parents we re at the end of their op she got pregnand and she was like well you know hey this is my ticket to me v out because she gets heir own place she gets money for herself money for baby she does not have to pay any utilities or anything and you know what more could she want you know was basically what she was saying i have got my owmplace i can do what ever i want i am getting money and i do not have to work and and so that i think is a very bad si shuation because they are almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5538/ 9620) 
right 

Recording: (5539/ 9620) 
because i had a lot of frustration built up what is next <laugh> get a whole list there

it is right on their main street and they have gorgeous really neat unice things 

Recording: (5854/ 9620)

Recording: (6025/ 9620) 
for the most part yeah i mean obviously like thy said they came out and said the catholic church was against it but at the same time like th research things like that where they are saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts where i mean they could not can not so much really condem it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6026/ 9620) 
but it is because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger morgage so it is just that kind of thing 

Recording: (6027/ 9620) 
uh i do not know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but u but it is i i do not like it as well as clumbus at all mainly i suppose because of the university e yah

Recording: (6030/ 9620) 
heard about that but the same principle applis but i am talht by just eveery day things uh that uh people wou w ve you want to talk of t chap children primarily uh there is no penalty anymore uh parents are scared to death uh to pick uh one up and spank them uh with their baire hands or or to make them stand in tha corner because they considered it a am go back to the word herrasmic child abuise and howasment of consequence uh and a a an penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply look at ganian an gane you should not do that 

Recording: (6031/ 9620) 
oh yeah um 

Recording: (6032/ 9620) 
well yeah i think it is real important to really good o get a good um feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that they have to really match and um and if they do not um then it is not ever going to work becaus because there is always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing so i think it is real important and there is no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do then that is the only time that you can really commit and say yeah we do have a mutual theng and young people they are you know there is so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get you know off course and everything else and and then it does not stay the same i mean it is all exciting and and all that and then i you know i think it is kind of <laugh>

that um incompuses the uh theory that all things happen for a reason even though it seems like it is caos even though it seems like it is an accident ah there is a flow of spirit in this world things are moving at a pace that they are supposed to move out and things happen and death is part of life physical that and that is one of the things i also learned through this was that you do not die you know physically maybe you know there is no denying that but spiritually not even physical death can break that that won no

Recording: (6066/ 9620) 
you know technically there is insanity and there is an insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who is an insane and uh just to to nock them out is is not appropriate they need to be we need to try to save them uh mean not in the terms of a christian saving but uh to make them work that off and uh face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt and uh <laugh> uh so i have got two sides to that once they need to work because they did it and the other side is if we keep uh i i believe in the uh uh reincarnation the law cas an effect and if a person murder somebody they nee they will they will pay for that later there is no question about that in the next life but also i think that they should be made to face their uh their guilt and what they have done and and a lot of them do not they say that harden chriminals real hard criminals will not aver admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to 

Recording: (6067/ 9620) 
ve to get them thinking about itnd then they will start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it they will start getting more and more into it 

Recording: (6068/ 9620) 
do not say oh well your son is going to be gay he is two right now let us you know change this so it so it does not come out to be a problem or whatever but i mean i think they would need to leave that to the decision of the people 

Recording: (6069/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6070/ 9620) 
you can not you can not be matded somebody for choosing a livestyle you just can not life is too short you know i mean you can love them either way it does not make any difference 

Recording: (6071/ 9620) 
right te same way with kids if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson but it is also the parent that has to set the example and there is too many older folks right now i do not think because of two people have to work outsideof the house they get home they are aggravated they are ups et somebody ele th had their kids all day and it is it is it is terrible that the situation is got that way but i do pleeve that the older people including are government people and everybody at is the the top has to set the example and stick with it 

Recording: (6072/ 9620) 
as he was speaking and and as he s tarted tos speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous inmpression on how we as people are doing here but how the politicians are s because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better and all these other countries ind us are just like all one country anymore or something and i think that is had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 

Recording: (6073/ 9620) 
huhhuh 

Recording: (6074/ 9620) 
now that was up the age a tanto are they are about to i think that the you sait to get back to the very beginning of the birr than up throug kinnig arents or for wat i that i that is the family but i think that we in our educational program we really need to start teaching uh what i call the older values of but but be good values i do not ok n whether ther old er new but good valuese and i think we really need to have that ar thabege within our educational system uh starting in the elementaryan right on up through college i think they are ought to be a number of colleg ah courses uh that that de voted exclusively for this so that those students cing go back and buh uh assist in teaching but i think that many of the courses other courses ought to have elements withhin them that are teaching value family values uh i could even so go so far as ti say an chemistry or bottainy or scychology uh any one of those those are specialized subject and and but i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value o family value uh and it will help then permiate the entire society and but it is got to start back here in ha pfirst and i think 

Recording: (6075/ 9620) 
and sooner or later you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service a guarantee you they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference but but once they get in there it is such a buracracy 

Recording: (6076/ 9620) 
and it is not just like one group of people 

Recording: (6077/ 9620) 
that that is what is making the these kids think they they can do it i just really think 

Recording: (6078/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (6079/ 9620) 
oh you do know 

Recording: (6080/ 9620)

Recording: (6096/ 9620)

Recording: (6099/ 9620) 
basically because hf plans which the utilities had for our location they could not provide to us because of the uh the vester ruling so we had to go out and um uh do our own seurveys become s educated through uh courses uh through att and through purdu university it was and i think oh you had some courses and um ultimately the university here now has i think a major intelicommunication group but um the projects basically we were going from a um putting the other a network itself and we had you think of a pailine system or the used called dasa chain in the industry uh you had to wait and waitn for your turn to get on to a data network and uh we got down to the point where we went to a spoake network where everyone had a dedicated pipe 

Recording: (6100/ 9620) 
well iha been s i wauls not much i my being here and my daughter being there i did not really have the uh time with her than i wished i would have had you know but uh uh her mother you know ded theare all right ind everything but i wished i would have been inmore involved in her growing up annd i think two people families are generally but er you know for not necessarilly living be you know uh being married ind everything but 

Recording: (6101/ 9620) 
shnn yeah uh-huh u um we do not have enough saxkof phones sure we could use yah <laugh> 

Recording: (6102/ 9620) 
yeah my brother well he is the oldest oldest but two sisters pretty much all the ones i really care about two sisters and their husbands 

Recording: (6103/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (6104/ 9620) 
yeah oh was not anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so 

Recording: (6105/ 9620) 
yeah like a lot of people like i do not i do not know why a lot of people go but like with a lot of people i know it is like go to hear really good music i like it is amazing like what happens you know like people together ad like people dancing together you look out and everybody is dancing you know like the music is really good and everybody is really into it and working 

Recording: (6106/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (6107/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (6108/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (6109/ 9620) 
most he people i associate with ind this and that are a lot more involved in there with their kids than say our parents were as kids you know 

Recording: (6110/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (6111/ 9620) 
nd but ynou know that there in goes back to uh you know the quality or the quantity i mean if obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so myserable in his life that he was going down in the stairs in the basement to you know to figure out some way of uh reaching his nevervana or whatever you know and uh than his parents did not have a clue or if they did they did not care you know 

Recording: (6112/ 9620) 
but at the same time it is not like they had the intent to do it so i can not see anything too incredibly severe um but i mean i almost think it should be considered basically child neglect things like that um basially the same penalties that you would run into for that um but i mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids hase the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6113/ 9620) 
oh yes definitely in england too 

Recording: (6114/ 9620) 
so he did not

Recording: (6119/ 9620) 
yeah eighty four 

Recording: (6120/ 9620) 
oh it is just so vethe environment of course is incredibly beautiful uh and everybody is more uh i think more open or more receptive to relationships amnd uh you know i think it is a f much frendlier place and thend i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just do not have proverty well if anybody is in proverty in oregan it is because they have chosen to live a symple life it is not a you know because they can not get jobs and things like that although the economy in oregn is not that great but you know they say in ugine that even the disworsiers have p achd the <laugh> well the the uh the level of the years of education por capitis probably the highest in the country 

Recording: (6121/ 9620) 
not there other important roles where would those nuns be where would your mother possiably n she went to cathlic school i take it where would she hav been if it wernt for the nuns why we put nuns down hey they worked lot less than your mother is eveng gettin compencated for and they had a very important role for your development even though your generation i removed

Recording: (6123/ 9620) 
i heard something the other day that really really upset me i was at um this convention downtown the convention center and uh one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops as a college professor in english at one of the ohio colleges and she said when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five they would always she teaches writing technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world reports and stuff she said they used to say gear you are writing to a person who is in the eighth grade

Recording: (6126/ 9620) 
well actually i have picked up a part time job just in the past month ortiod so i am i am working fora research firm just for the convenience of the hours i i want i got back in tof a nursing field but right now i just can not take that much time away because i would be at least an eight hoursifht and uh i do not think that we are ready for that he is a teacher um-hum he works at high school yeaw he teaches nineth and tenth graders no <laugh> i do not think that at all i would be deceeving myself i think i i guess when i i hear about them i am just like i am like os i can not believe all o thof the the things that these kids are experiencing i did nontt know about whatever until i was much much older i did not worry about that when i was that age and it is kind of scary 

Recording: (6127/ 9620) 
and uh and they are not the kind that would go out and just shoot an animal woud shoot it they would use it food they sometimes they hi know one time that they gave it to a family that was uh did not have any money and did not have any food they j would not killed some animals and gave it to hand i do not have a problem with that uh uh but my brotherinlaw is very much opposed to any kind of gunf control he he believes whatever charlton heston tells him

Recording: (6138/ 9620) 
i think it would probably i i think it would be certainly interesting 

Recording: (6139/ 9620) 
um yes and no like i said i think the average person is a pretty decent person i mean i do not think ha there is anything violent or thery are just anything wrong with them but at the same time it is just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and makes som big deals of the ones that are out of control and i think that is sort of what people l pick up their perception to be i mean they do not they do not show about like when people are helphing people out or things like that when the local high schools like volunteering at like the local senior citizen is home or something like that 

Recording: (6140/ 9620) 
but i mean like if test schores are identical and the have the exact same experience you know objective ways 

Recording: (6141/ 9620)

Recording: (6165/ 9620)

Recording: (6169/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (6170/ 9620) 
i you know from my perspective which is skuwed of course to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was we are only talking about ten cases that is not very many you know i mean you could by coincidence have them all be african american um if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective and i you know i do not do not live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police so uh you know i just do not i am i am not in touch with it with that situation 

Recording: (6171/ 9620)

oh well we really wants to go he lived in california that is where that family i told you about was he and when he is fourteen or sixteen and he really wants to go back so we will probably end up there sometime but after i finished school and after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough money and i mean we do not need to have a tun but we just should be at least a little out of debt so yeah something 

Recording: (6175/ 9620) 
it is just 

Recording: (6176/ 9620) 
so <laugh> 

Recording: (6177/ 9620) 
you know 

Recording: (6178/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (6179/ 9620) 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction i still think that there is considerable progress progression that needs to be made uh i was just talking this so whene a couple o weeks ago whois uh fhellw history major and her and actually her brother is a fellow fellow history majo are two and a friend of min i do not know them all that whell but uh parently her family i mean she is she is double major history in chemistry she plans to go to med school her parents her family supports here in this but they have made it painfully clear that when that she should not plan on having a career because it she is going to have to raise children at some point which is uh that is not the way things should work in my beliefh an and and the fact that it is like the mals telling the daughter likn thi is how things need to be i think i mean you know i think an i indal individual should have the choice but i feel i mean i i am concerned about a a uh like this push to the right that is sort of going i am hoping at is sort of dying out but i mean it seemed a little scary or bhack in liked ninety four in ninety five but uh i think we have reached a point where becaus not all of the advances have been one hundred percent successful the the opposition is chriticcizing the advance 

Recording: (6180/ 9620) 
but when he did have something to do with them it was kind of strange they would go out and whissle at girls and stuff like that 

Recording: (6181/ 9620)

Recording: (6257/ 9620) 
yeah they will just take one scripture and they wil expand it um and and they will just run with that one scripture and then there are also churtues that wiill just deleats they will and in my nd their minds they will dolleat certain sections of the scripture that they do not like first carinthians chapter twelve talks about um spiritual gifts and that is one of the big things that i am into down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and and um the extremely taboo um religious topic among a lot of churches is the gift of tongs whether it is dead whether it is not whether it is inspired whether it is not inspired yeah hi wod e ougt of blablaw well i had not even heard about it untill i got to columbus because and and i know the bible pretty well and i had not even heard about it until i got to columbas and i get tho columbus and i am like okay this is pretty cool i went home and i am talking to some people in my parentis church and they are like oh yeah um we just do not really talk about that very often and hand i am just

Recording: (6264/ 9620) 
um-hum umhu 

Recording: (6265/ 9620) 
oh there always has been there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids lot of kids are on medication to day that should not be but um i think that is the fault of the school or the parnts or some doctor that like for example when we have refer e kids and worthingten to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with and we know that they will not jus give thi kt a pill if he does not have eight out of the twelve symptems or whatever so we refer them to those doctors and then if this those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it is usually just for the school day not during the summer not over vacation not after five oclock not on the weekends and it is just to help them focus and then these docktors also ast for reports back from the teachers and if you do not see any appreciable difference and two or three weeks and you take the kid off and you try something else and some kids medication is like the dif ference between night and day you go back in a obzerve the kid you kan not believe it is the same kid other kids does not pace them they mat as will be drinking a glass of water well since they have side effects like they stunt yur grouth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other you know some kids get headakes from dexkadrin and at or all so i say you know if ot works use it if it if it does not work just forget it but you know a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because there may be just not able to pay attentiond a little bit but then not really eighdd and the parents are taking them in and going u of thes not getting stre days put ting on in something <laugh> so i guess 

Recording: (6266/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6267/ 9620)

Recording: (6280/ 9620) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (6281/ 9620) 
well they needed to strike do not get me wrongnd that is not the stupid part but the part was uh the majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and he not making that much money most people would move on 

Recording: (6282/ 9620) 
yeah well the white man would probably win but the black man also has a he has a better chance than the woman i ould think

Recording: (6284/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (6285/ 9620)

Recording: (6287/ 9620) 
uhum 

Recording: (6288/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (6289/ 9620) 
and i mean yeah they find the cause of it whatever you know that is good but at the same time it the cause of it does not really matter i mean the fact ofte matter is it is there they have to deal with it so 

Recording: (6290/ 9620) 
um media has a lot of control over people but i believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that 

Recording: (6291/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (6292/ 9620) 
see the thing is ideally i would rather if i were going to buy a housebang clintan vill to hold them and rent them my probam mis i do not have any money so i that thown payment a has to be ten percent down and so that means that i would have that tied up while it was being rented like we bought a couple of condoas over on bethel road for my kids toll live in soh my oldest girl when she was going ready to move out she was like twenty four and they could not find any place to live that i thought was that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable so i finally decided well we will find something and i will buy it and i will be your landlady and then w it will it will be nice and so i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to was thinking she was going to move out when she graduate from high school and changed your mind so i woud just run that one but it the bottom line is i i just got a i could mortgage and i have a guy that i worked with that helped me buy those without any money i did not have a down payment i had nothing so so it is like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment but the other you would you would be find you would be running you would not buy anything that you did nothink you could rent and come out even with 

Recording: (6293/ 9620) 
you know i just got out of it 

Recording: (6294/ 9620)

and do not insult us anymore or we will go to trial u so my attorney jumped ut back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars i could not take set ing ere these guys going back and forth of what they felt it was worth even ther arbitrater was at as holl um but uh that is the way that system works

Recording: (6297/ 9620) 
right 

Recording: (6298/ 9620) 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own i am thinking i may get into that 

Recording: (6299/ 9620) 
um-hum yeah i am just learning the area so but i like it so far it seems really nice and uh seems like there is a lot more to do in columbus obviously but 

Recording: (6300/ 9620) 
uh

Recording: (6314/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (6315/ 9620)

Recording: (6322/ 9620) 
like you mean sexual relationships and what um probably the the bad things about it yeah um but just come in from like christian beliefs and what not the best thing and i know it even though i did not partake in it when i was a teenager and i was not promiscuous at all but i still had sex before marriage um just to be it would be nice if they would teach you how to be confident yourself and i do not mean like self esteem but you know like we said if if uh you know you come from a situation like that that does not mean you have to be like that do you knowhathey mean kind of 

Recording: (6323/ 9620)

Recording: (6325/ 9620) 
even my mother who is she said if nixkson were running ta day she would vote for thim she is that much of a conservative uh agrees with what is happened but most people will say the same thing there should have ben another way to get him out of there but at this point i do not think there really was uh a few months ago yeah but 

Recording: (6326/ 9620) 
i am not sure i do not know his his dad found it and told me about it because i was not working at the time and we were trying to get an extra income to come in and um his dad made it actually like twenty five dollars or something you know i would think he would make more than tha man every time we go over ther he is up on the computer doing something so and i am on ther you know just i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff um you know like reading about things that happend to people like they are kids spitting up in their face or something

Recording: (6329/ 9620) 
idow i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 

Recording: (6330/ 9620) 
hit is just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that is sort of kids for y i mean they just obviously they are gonto be curious about things and the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it but i do not know to what degree that they should go with it 

Recording: (6331/ 9620) 
i mean if i would have chosen to do that well it is my choic oh god my husband is a lot better ar these type of questions because he was methodist and he chows to trink cathlic when we got married and his perception of the methodist religion and the cathlic religion and the more i was exposed to his itis like boy thes really are similar but yours is a lot looser than mine andyou know <laugh> was you k um just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about suks and drugs and being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open and then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children 

Recording: (6332/ 9620) 
umhumoh okay 

Recording: (6333/ 9620)

she is going all right as far as i know she is going to saint louis university i do not ask me why but 

Recording: (6342/ 9620) 
<laugh> but um um one time i i read somewhere that a a mexican lady who came across the boarder to have her baby and they put the little band on and they wrote female and then they wrote her last name she said to her husband when he came over to see her well they have already named her look famali 

Recording: (6343/ 9620) 
no 

Recording: (6344/ 9620) 
well unfortunately i do not think it is fair but i think in the long run it does not have to be a college education because most of those people probably would not want a college education um but like a trade or a skill or something that will gv them a little bit oa hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of probabing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did they have that choice it is it is it is up in their head okay i can either go become a welder or i can have a gun um i mean if they want a college education um yeah it is it is not fair but for if for you growing up and going into a life style i would prefer having they ire college is paid for and then being productive citizens then somebody robbing me someday because they did not get an education i mean ow that is ik broad spectrum and i know it is not all that cut and drud um yeah it would upset me but hopefully i would step back from it a little bit and go well maybe it is for the best yeah 

Recording: (6345/ 9620) 
righ 

Recording: (6346/ 9620)

Recording: (6382/ 9620) 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will willsol be changing ind the future uh going all the way back uh finances uh we are we are not a consideration ind he in oh i say probablyn my first thirty may be forty years there was some there was influence but i think the influene was not pinancial it was influence from the person who could get up phere an talk with a group of people and sway them with his and i want to use the word opinion but i know that is not right it he sway them with a position that he had dheveloped now that is not necessarily his opinion so i am trying to make a point there <laugh> but he would sway them based uppon the influences that he had had from uh uh various people within his community or whether whether you are talking about a coun ship pror counti state whatever it may be and yes u uh then p slowly then i thinc the finances came in the play and finances have come to uh horrible horrible situation as of today and i will leave out this the the last two years it ha of course it is becaurse it is rather specific right now but going back to two years ore four years ago finances we are still a very very heavy consideration and not not just on the uh national level but i am shino even on local levels i know wewithin the imediat communitythere are people oult theire uh h comoin we will go t to din or we will edoll to this and w will do this and do this justh just barely barly braking uh the barior but not braking the law uh so gues bvery definitly progressively has changed

Recording: (6397/ 9620) 
like a girl friends of mine 

Recording: (6398/ 9620) 
ell they are now in a sense uh it is easier to to go somewhere else i think and the wb on tv if you have you know like for news for local news channels and they are all saying the same thing and emphasising the same things there is no choice there if you want the news you are going ta get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else uh and you know major newspapers are all over the web uh you have been pick and shoese and you can see different perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and i think you get a a whiter view yea 

Recording: (6399/ 9620)

Recording: (6749/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (6750/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (6751/ 9620) 
well how he felt in knowing that we were not neglecting him or two different things we have always emphasized that knowing what is right or knowing that what is justice one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one 

Recording: (6752/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (6753/ 9620) 
um yeah 

Recording: (6754/ 9620) 
no not at all i would have rather voted for mickayn over bush because bush he he comes from a political family whichi am not saying is wrong because the kennedies were a big political family but i am saying like bush is um he just seems like he did not really like h everything is been handed to him in life and uh the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that is a big issue but i do not like the way he addressed it you know that to me just if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake but the way he is handling it saying i am not even going no digknify that question over and over and over if he did not do it he might as well just be like no i did not do it 

Recording: (6755/ 9620) 
no <laugh> actually i was uh going to get my gd after that 

Recording: (6756/ 9620) 
yeah with all the controversy about that and pollaras and um i do not know it is northland is such uh a good location for all the people around there and it is certainly not you know u um uh hurting te ore you know a neighborhood that people do not need the shopping so i did not see the difference of having both i mean there is lasers everywhere thery are seers everywhere a not why not have it both places i mean i would not particularly go up to pollars if they take northland but we are not planning on staying there anyway so i did not yeah we will probably move within the year um-hum

Recording: (6761/ 9620) 
and of course i think too as in america the uh the farm families you know they wanted that was more labors for the vinards so to speak so i think that might have ben flouenced a lot of that but over the years it it uh it just made sense to me in fact it looks like in my family that theire going to the children are going to be mostly and twos you know not even going to three or four i mean it is not over yet but my girls are forty two and forty o soon to be forty one so um i think that their child bearing years are over

some ideal ideas about it so i a i figured something i should know about so <laugh> <laugh> 

Recording: (7205/ 9620) 
adoption is different i think thuh wirh hit hen adoption is entirely different than when you can seeve wit somebody else is spurm or somebody else is whatever uh because idoption means that i can no have any children or i see a child over here that needs help and you are then you are reaching out to your friend youare neighbor you are not just forgetting about thimg an let the welper somebody take chare of them and let them go down the drain and i think that that is what adoption is and and you are really accepting this responsibility and that is lup and when yu are trying and willing to have well some people wiull probably aregue about this but i am sorry if got did not mean that i can can see even have my own child why should i try to implant somebody else is inside ofe me and produce it i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really needs needs help and adopt that baby because you can see them and you can help them and you are already a where to a certain extent of what geens sey y might ave enherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you do not it later on you wil find out but if still you can go back and you can find the parent and i do not know whether they are gon to be able to trace thee geens back and say you know later on if something happens that this child you are having and find out well what did they inherit over here but if you have adopted a child you can go back and you can find it ot and help the child better

Recording: (7210/ 9620) 
wowl um i do not know if there could be there are certain programs different community base programs getting but again those are my values i wus no say stearing the kids into a church base program if they can not be there putting them with um families and friends that you know and trust to to look after them givething them the guidance that they need the wy mca programs are wonderful they give them a structured activity to do where they are supervised but again those programs a lot of times cost money that the families do not have and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs

Recording: (7218/ 9620) 
when in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people on tv and then you started seeing a couple of black people on tv and then there was the jeffhersons and although i found the jeffersons offensive in many ways because it wase sterio typical and made fun of of of black people and many ways in retrospect it was trend setting and what it did and and even in putting blacks in um advertisements on tv young kids saw them uh and and saw those ads and saw those tv programs and so it became uh ah part of everyday life an and the more you see something the more it be becomes more acceptable so maybe that is having and in fact maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those tv programs and think they were trend setting instead of sterio typical um but i am sure it does have uh some influence because it i think it did it it was not the only thing that had an influence but it was one of the little pieces of the pusle that that helps i think mathew shepherd helped also 

Recording: (7219/ 9620)

Recording: (7402/ 9620) 
highly skilled or trained in that area i mean you can not really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad and again as i mentioned previously i think it is more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other and i mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and i mean you are you are never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and differenk likes but i can not help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something a like that that you know had to have been more than jus you know sort of normal jogks versus whatever so i think it should be more i do not know i mean even you know i went to ah private cph like high schools but even there you know there was you know a a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on should definitely not i have been going on and tha was only on a very small ofer therye were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean this is a high school with like several hundred students that this happened at so 

Recording: (7403/ 9620)

no sunlight you know that and they do not give him they keep it warm and they he is not a lowt of sheets or raisors or you know other thanan electric raser so he can not kill himself so you are just stuck e there is no thing you coul do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies and that to me t would be tliyk that to me he is actually like that has to be worse like just a agony and the and i think you would have to go and say an like there is reallyh so much you i wouo actufor board games or something but like yheu can does not even hear a human voice because i think it is something like that was ritten in the scriptures like you are dead to the world for u is the worst that you can do and so ththe world sees him you know tan i mean so that would be rough that would be real rough and so obviously he would want to um i like they say like now like people that observe thim he is like he sings to himself and he reads the bible like every day and but like i do not know that would be strange it would b is such a horrible thing to go through i could not imagine being locked in a room for like few days

and a lot of times unions uh they actually actually seem detrimental like to productio and to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union because if a union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and things like that and like that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees these lazy a lazy union as a representative of of these workers so they are more apt to go outside 

Recording: (7423/ 9620)

like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh the some elementary school i believe or kno i think it is a high school andmarian was built on um an old weapons deepo and so like lukiemia is rison and so like that is what their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and uh get that changed they have also done other things uh a their they do anything dealing with the environment uh like exposure uh things like that so

Recording: (7455/ 9620) 
or or somebody or or or later they will claim that i was coersed to saying that as i walked out the door you know and it is a big ly 

Recording: (7456/ 9620) 
so 

Recording: (7457/ 9620)

i went to um for grade school and um for high school 

Recording: (7462/ 9620) 
or des hit say this you know this is what i thought thi said does that what that really says well here is a perfect example the other day my kids my six scritters turned in papers on if i could be an animal here is the animal i would be and here is why and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and they are whether they travel and groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habbitat what they eat all that okay perfect example one of my students wanted to say my animal that i picked lives mostly on vegetables and he could not figure out how spell it so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestabules 

Recording: (7463/ 9620) 
right 

Recording: (7464/ 9620) 
oh man 

Recording: (7465/ 9620)

Recording: (7467/ 9620) 
existing area i mean they could actually well yeah they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something feed them or something 

Recording: (7468/ 9620) 
light news uh that is why i read you tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a different perspective it i it is probably just slanted but it is different you are right 

Recording: (7469/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (7470/ 9620) 
i think so because i 

Recording: (7471/ 9620) 
which is um which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of rosas and those types of things you can get some that are older that need to need a lot of work but that is a pretty high demand area 

Recording: (7472/ 9620) 
uhum 

Recording: (7473/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (7474/ 9620) 
okay that is why they did a lot a lot of like biological studies is up erearwes okay i have heard of it 

Recording: (7475/ 9620) 
um 

Recording: (7476/ 9620) 
l youou had womenthat are working before you had womenr workng before but self discipline dos not break then on a family that is part of it self discipline making things too easy for us oh we can not do ithout itd you ever d you ever try to work for som i mean you really truggle to atchieve something did it mean more to you than something that was given to you tell me 

Recording: (7477/ 9620) 
well i have a maybe when i i am a hundred i will have that figured out 

Recording: (7478/ 9620) 
then my sister lives in the middle of nebraska nobody visits <laugh> obody wants to go to nebraska yeah what is out there i m com wath theur corn grow 

Recording: (7479/ 9620) 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jobs about that i remember um driving to dgermany with a couple of english friends and to visit some german friends of theirs and we got there and it we were got lost and all these things that took us way along ago and it should have ben a friend of the person we were visiting said like oh what did you have to stop at every micdonald is along the way and i was like i i m a vegetarian i do not even eat im mcdonald is you know and i was just you know and it was really mean it is like that is not really a very good joke and that kind of thing came up quite frequently but you know i always said micdonald is would not survive here if no one aigt there and you can not tell me that everyone in there is american 

Recording: (7480/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7481/ 9620) 
the well there is the whole thing about the police chief and then there is the whole thing about um about the loss of the federal law suit against columbus 

Recording: (7482/ 9620) 
dhan that is what we are concerned with you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people every day of our life that is where wo learn from we do not learn by giving things to people just like if you are uh uh a parent getting a giving a allowance you do not give them the your kids uh money to do chors they normally expect them to do but you give them something in addition to devellup more responsibility <laugh> but we do not talk about responsibility our socitey to day i i i dare you to say we are they say publically this is our bill of responsibility do you know where there is do you talk about responsibilitye now 

Recording: (7483/ 9620) 
yeah and it is uh it is not too bad because i hald to scratch off your ticket you gave me 

Recording: (7484/ 9620) 
i just well i did not understand as much as you probably <laugh> <laugh> i justs like clules as to what i needed to do to become an art major and i go to my advisor and they woul tell me what to take and it was the art advisor but i did not really think i had to do anything special like i di not knw know about the port polio review and all that stuff and that was probably my own fault for not asking questions but so it took me a while and then i just kind of went to coma state and went on a mission and then came back and so i just got accepted into that college but yeah 

Recording: (7485/ 9620) 
stuff like that and i think they even might have fined like one or two guns so and that to me was but my high school is is two thousand people so i guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun 

Recording: (7486/ 9620) 
i do i am against religion in school i just do not think they should push that on people um you know i mean i do not think they should make people pray if they do not want to before class or anything you know like that but as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what is out there and you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 

Recording: (7487/ 9620) 
i am on the computer at least six hours a day 

Recording: (7488/ 9620) 
that is surprising 

Recording: (7489/ 9620) 
does that make sense 

Recording: (7490/ 9620) 
like just like um like communal showers and stuff and like um just how it is like one room that you lke kind of living or whatever you know it is more like like the army or something you know like real everything is real simple and everything is uniform and like i do not know 

Recording: (7491/ 9620) 
and she just came here and lived with me a year ago so she could have her baby here 

Recording: (7492/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (7493/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (7494/ 9620) 
yeah i think that is pro you know i am i am not that familiar with it now but i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that that people fall through 

Recording: (7495/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (7496/ 9620) 
ell i got the sense that if there are discipline problems it is so hard to get anything done to solve them unless you know unless somebody brings a gun and waiys around the school you know that is the big thing now but just the you know it is just so hard to get anything done um and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they do not see the support cr up through the administration an if they do have a they have to wait untill something is pretty pretty agrigious before they before it is dealt with 

Recording: (7497/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (7498/ 9620) 
i would be a lot happier 

Recording: (7499/ 9620) 
i actually joined the church an uhs well i do not know it was six years ago about six years ago and they did a survey here at oeyu and they were um just asking people if they thought that crist had visited america and there was a record of that account if do i think that would be important and i js like well i think so yeah and but i did not i was kind of hesitant i mean it took me a while to i read the book of ormmandand i really prayed about it and took me about six months and and then i finally decided that i really it liked it and thit was what i had been wanting so so that is how i decided 

Recording: (7500/ 9620) 
right because everything that has a cupon has tons of fat tons of shugar and it is over priced 

Recording: (7501/ 9620) 
yeah they yeah she moved in with him 

Recording: (7502/ 9620)

<laugh> 

Recording: (7512/ 9620) 
i used to live up there too 

Recording: (7513/ 9620) 
well generally they have some area i do not think i have ever met the kid yeah the special kid who has no area that he des non excelling like once i had a six grade girl who still did not know her time tables and six grade but she had a beverally cells opera voice and in every single school production she was the lead singer i had a girl once that won all kind of mettals and gimnastics at the state level it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i have had kids who hve thay got every bad you can getting boy scouts and you know i mean there is usually something that they are really it might not be related to school but there is usually something that they are really really good at in some other area like there is swimming or or scouting or whatever so they you know but generally speaking they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than the normal person with a hunderd or ninety five icu yeahn i have seen them long enough to know that and worked with hem long enough to know that well like i have one boy who can not spell them he still spells at t ach i m and he took my computer apart the other day and at justed something in the mothere board and put it back together now it works 

Recording: (7514/ 9620)

i really think civil rights have gone too far because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person there is another rule over says is that is okay if that o the person does it to you i mean thereand my mother used to say if for every lawll that was ritten there is another law ritten over here there w will actually knolify that one and i and actuallay ha i have growing older i found it and it is it is worse than to they is world as i said as the silver right is move ent and you ha have a right to thi and you have a right to that it is terrible murderers get away with murder now by that pleebargin that ple bargan i think is the moset bthink tha ever was passt i do not think there should be any plee bargens and then the pie is ar wha woul there are people whoho ged murdered in innosaint to lecter chair lactere chair i still believe in it because if someone his po and i do not belie that they should have ten years of uh what do they call that ptlegawol process where they can where thing appeals thank you that is it i do not think that yoeu should have that either wone if peal or two should be the limit if there is sti pound gilty sorry and if an innocenot person has nont ben able tdo prove he is innocent that is just one of those freeky things that happens because some times innocent peole de pay the penalty for someone else that is guilty that is corrupene enough bhat he is mined than heu knowi hiw to get away with hit and gets somebod else tay hi is blain but i do not thik there is that many innocent peole thut ever went to they w li re chair that they should actually have nolapighd that because what right tis hat person have to liv tv just about two or three days ago and here is this guy don n the outh thin and as the is walked out and cogh be hind him and tho putting him to cruser whe what did tere c acually what i said i is got to do i s go a co to what cur draw her last breath he killed her now he is got to go and p me b a ple bargin and he wil get off with thit becaus mey be he was abused is a child nd it has saning do the wy he is thinking what happened to this woman be cause of it i am sorry let him pay the penalty and if more people paid the penalty there wourl be more people thinking wi se three fourare trimngso be foar they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 

Recording: (7625/ 9620) 
that is exactly whatt 

Recording: (7626/ 9620) 
well i do not know that that is a cause u it they they as a group uh n this was kind of tha happenstance and it this occurred as a result of a vherve he major worold war uh so n an in terms of them causing it it was it was a happentance and and part of this mask communication we are talking about uh began with them and yase they are a major nfluence becau yhew are talking about numbers and you are talking about uh uh great a greater inter communication i would like to go back one ste where we are talking about when i made mention that threedoo ors down you do not ebe know who that intivhidual is and i want to stick with that uh i think that is profound as an individual communication we or nearring ziro in terms of global mass communication to every body with inter personal communiiccations that is the kee in my opinion personal versus interpersonal communications a an and it zero ver hearm ere almors a hundrerd percent over here but when we are in this inter persional or globale or maci of what you ever term is the mose appropriat uh jon dow who speak here he has not ha faintust idea who gaindo is over here on the personal it used to be that yeah yu knew who this person res over here that is janedo that lives and that thired out an he married henrijackson do ntermemmer ov henry wher henrwas te guy liv wey over there ind the other side of town mask communications as it is today a have not tha fhaintest idea o where gancame from or where henry jackon or where od whoever wars lived over there i said so i think i incom need te distinguish between the personal interpersonal relationship so maybe i die cras to far there b or who the next door neighbor is 

Recording: (7627/ 9620) 
l i see i am going to have tho fall way back and tall my eigge again as most people would say uh i i would realy like to see this t happen but i also know that it mo it will never happen within the next three or four generations but i i am of a guy who still believes that the lady has a plates in her home and i do not belye that we need uh man and wife out working and making incomes as every one t in the united states to day feels they must uh hazal heit upon it rather lately a while ago and is talking about need versus uh luxuries i want i want i want well i my judgement is that we are spending to day pprobably eighty percent of uh the income on things that they want and only twenty percent on what they need and that is all they need to spend on that need so therefore the nes pardon

um-hum 

Recording: (7758/ 9620) 
there is not a lot around you know and we were on the list for ever we ware on the list five years before we had our first kids yeahand they callt well you knw still wan to be on the list yeah we do not have any children but keep us on the list you know and it is like you say it is and there is three or four hundred kids in that day care it is a large day care but there is not a lot out there that is good quality you know i mean you it is scary and then you seeing the news uh h theye we are apusing the kids or you know and you do not want to go to work feeling that you are worrying about your kids and we have never really felt like that and we kind of work a little different shift my wife and nice so our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she does not start until nine thirty and i pick them up at four so 

Recording: (7759/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (7760/ 9620) 
o it is real negative she is real negative about things and and triys to put me down for being positive or you know i always see a way out of something and she does not and she i think she gets kind of mad in place she s feels like she is old at fifty and i said nt my gosh you do not even have any bad habits i said you know you could live to be a hundred that is fifty moure years you know i mean if you look at it that way she is really you know fifty is not old at all to me i mean that is just he as much as you learn you know you can not treaid that but yeah my my one sister that is um exactly seven years older than me we are the closest and then the sister that is two years older than me she is the same way she does a lot of things that i am like why are you doing that you know they wl d so and she is she pretty much stays low and impressed a lot because of everything she goes through but 

Recording: (7761/ 9620) 
yeah she she had to talk and my sister and i attendit and i do not like the problem i think with universal health care would be everyone do not you think like everyone with a little a scratch would go in you know a as opposed to like the very and i think that could drive cost up so there has to be a wayh to balance i am not sure how you would go about doing that becaus youdo not want to put a limit and say okay you can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7762/ 9620) 
read the paper and have the tv of there is something i think i might want to i might be interested in so i just do all those things and do my machine 

Recording: (7763/ 9620) 
i do not know i think i really do not know i think ind to days world what they call the ninties that uh it is just like everything is changed like when i grew up we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standard s and when there were certain things we did or did not do and then hey came along with that when our kids grew up then there were so many things that change is some of the one thing i ju stains out and this s hit s othing to do with politics but it is an example in in school they changed the way they were doing theirh mathematics i could not even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geomatry n algibra you would think ou d i used he a straight ages and algibra when i got to geomadray thoug why i my taking this so that was not so good but still the way they were teaching it now and theire e teaching it entirely different now and i think linda explaine to how they were doing het with matheu and said she could not even help him an so you know it s in the he same way with politics it people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and i think it is to me it is getting worse but then my mother used the say t ang in about our generation so i think it is just the sine of the times i do not know what it is

uum 

Recording: (7898/ 9620) 
right um personally i think git is a good idea i mean i i mean to me you know it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that but i come from a completlyly different you know background and everything else and the education than a you know than most of probably the people thet this would um concert but i do think i i do not know i mean with the burth control that is available and you know all the options that there are sometimes i find it hard to be sympathetic for you know these people who just have so many children than they can not feed they can not take care of i mean it is not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way i mean a woman can you know protect herself if you know the the men is not willing to do it or whatever so and an an adoption and all the other things

Recording: (8101/ 9620) 
he is 

Recording: (8102/ 9620) 
now know well it is good to have that i think it would be good to have that leaway <laugh> but i am not sure i would trust myself because there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have more of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others and i wanted to be fair in terms of um not cutting down the ones that i did not like that much <laugh> yeah yeah 

Recording: (8103/ 9620) 
youdoo 

Recording: (8104/ 9620) 
and i i really feel like if you are going to run for president ie states you ought to be smart

Recording: (8107/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8108/ 9620) 
he is really just yeah he does not think through the implications that things real wellin his personal li 

Recording: (8109/ 9620) 
i mean obviously being uh being a little boy i remember i mean just seeing even things like football or whatever i mean it is you would see something you thought it was neat so you would do it or whatever 

Recording: (8110/ 9620)

Recording: (8111/ 9620) 
yeaht it is as 

Recording: (8112/ 9620)

Recording: (8113/ 9620) 
i wish they could 

Recording: (8114/ 9620) 
um-hum 

Recording: (8115/ 9620) 
well yeah it is kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 

Recording: (8116/ 9620) 
lumpus needs that as much as people do not want other things to clothes i just feel we have to keep we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and you know i do not think that is really fair to them 

Recording: (8117/ 9620) 
likei to me that was very strange 

Recording: (8118/ 9620) 
oh she is cute she really is really cute i mean mean she is got big eyes and big fluffy cheaks 

Recording: (8119/ 9620) 
t is alway is going to be somebody it can complain about something well that is another thing where you have to take the individuality and do a count because not everybody likes to cook you know everybody most people know how to open a can of sup or something and boil water make some toast but you know that is about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because you know they are supposed to or whatever and i know some families where the men the the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking and the wife does you know whatever she does i mean itit is individuality again so 

Recording: (8120/ 9620) 
okay some people can like fly in doh do their do their little wedding thing fly out 

Recording: (8121/ 9620) 
yeah it is weird they ah this micerophon is a little bit different so 

Recording: (8122/ 9620)

Recording: (8123/ 9620) 
ahyou even got these uh stunt guns they are the ones that scare me 

Recording: (8124/ 9620) 
yeah jacon and and and i went together 

Recording: (8125/ 9620) 
um-hum um-hum 

Recording: (8126/ 9620) 
see that there again the business outboxks the consumer basically you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another try to understand your neighbor more and spending time getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life the tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and wit will be nothing and your investment is gone 

Recording: (8127/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8128/ 9620) 
well that used to be where you know all the teenage teenagers went 

Recording: (8129/ 9620) 
yeah exactly 

Recording: (8130/ 9620) 
right 

Recording: (8131/ 9620) 
um i mean i feel uh i lean toward no i do not have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering um crack mothers like money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that um but again like the argument there on the human right side was that if they are you know on cokan or whatever they can not make the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like can they make the sound decision to have children 

Recording: (8132/ 9620) 
because hee well i have had five babies you know i really have to work when you talke about that the older you get i have to work really really hard to stay in halfway decent shape 

Recording: (8133/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8134/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (8135/ 9620) 
know i mean the money you know the money is great you know find it is the biggest raise they have ever given anybody here at the university and actually the deal that they offer the sundey before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they have really settled for now as ar as because the signding bon is was more and the big stipulation was the fact that these people did not want to be separated from the hospital they do not think it is fair you know that yous start down at the hospital as e janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to mainke campus you whould make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and than they did ther raise and they want ad eighty cent hat the hospitaln tha dollar on mainke campus and stuff so that is kind of a sticky situation because they have always kept the university and the hospital separate budget they are thefinitely a separat budget you know the hospital i can see where they are coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that and they are thirty five million in the hole because they ave auterwas you east and all this but you know it is not the union is fougt that they are ran out they are contract you know and you know so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the interance wage is so low that it is hard to find anybody that hase any skills to come in and do the jobs that is you know and they want this place to be the top ten and the nation or whatever is far as but they are not woll n the pay a lot of these people and you know they think contracting is the way but you are always going the have to have people here tot because contractors just do not drop what they are doing and show up today and a lot of times we have a job finishe before they have ritten up the work order 

Recording: (8136/ 9620) 
well when you have formulas to make boms and you know 

Recording: (8137/ 9620) 
um-hum it i it is at the same building actually it is it is that it is used for different things 

Recording: (8138/ 9620) 
yeah i was oner nineteen my it was eighteen when i went in but 

Recording: (8139/ 9620) 
exactly but i do therr there is the other side um h uh with with native americans too it is you know you know our children are being taken away from us well not exactly you are giving up your children and and and something has to be done but but there is also there is also that he i am i mean i think it is probably a legitimate fear that children a children of that group are going t you know going to be homoginized out of out of their heritage but i do not know uh you know the are kids without parents <laugh> 

Recording: (8140/ 9620) 
i mean they are gazing congrss they are gase and the military you know is as long as people do not know they they do not feel threatened see nd and and i i i do not understand that mind set i really do not i do not know why uh a man feels threatend by having a gay near them u i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um you know does every man like every woman he sees is he attracted every woman and you know want to go to bed with every woman you know what makes a man think that just because i am gay i might be interested in him you know that is the hight of aragance um you know but but man feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatend by lesbands i do not know but it is not a mind sait i have so it is hard for me to understand

ou know imagine it not basically would happen her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually had her move in with them they were her temporary foster parents and she just turned sixteen so she was fifteen when she moved in with them she refused to change and i do not know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them i do not wan to say are doomed but they are not even though they are out of that environment they are not doing any better 

Recording: (8174/ 9620) 
no 

Recording: (8175/ 9620) 
yeah you still have to be careful then yan 

Recording: (8176/ 9620) 
um-hum i am sure somewhere i am sure somewhere along line they would work things out to try to help her over those bumps it would not be a long term and they would know that i would not be long term but that is that intangiable i am saying you have somebody there because she is giving up her time and not tho make the high bucks but what she is bringing about is developing a character and a person to bring about the spirituality and tha person that is going ta carry them all through life she is also uh tithing more than tithing probably whith uh i always uh kid with people i stad the author ta said ten percent tithing knew imflation he knewcgre about economics ten percent ais ten percent and then uh on top of that you know we talk about eueconomices uh little further here uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and to an german and so forth and uh boy you know takeing tha page ono the old bible are not they we do not <laugh> <laugh>

Recording: (8385/ 9620) 
alkay so umm christ and i uh spent the rest of the evening calling people i i got it in my head that i did not want anybody to call and say how is your dad doing and so the best way to dea with that situation wis to call a globaliy across the board plus it was a fun csychological experiment just as as they go because how often dod you get to tell people kill himself this morning so i i i hi i yo do i i no i have not talkd toyou n a litle hie with everything o okay i actually know my my father kiled himself this morning you are kidding so you you end up after dolsing yourso people narrowing it down you have got you are kidding you are not serious no

so 

Recording: (8394/ 9620) 
i have heard some of them talk about it 

Recording: (8395/ 9620) 
so i do not know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous um but i think that comes with ta with a bigger city when you get more people are is obviously going to be some more problems um i i mean that is really that is really all that i know itis it is obviously a lot more bulled up it is gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

Recording: (8396/ 9620) 
n that that makes sense and a lot of the new ball parks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people goo nuts people would rather see a tight game that was like seven to like six rather than watch like uh a two to one ball game 

Recording: (8397/ 9620)

Recording: (8407/ 9620) 
wel wel yeah we librarians traditionally have problems with it is like a form of senswership you know big brother things libebrarians i havei always had problems with that um i i do not know it is it is hard to balance it if somebody is out there actually doing criminal work criminal activity and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it is i do not know how to balance it 

Recording: (8408/ 9620) 
um as far as my brother goes i can not say i really see my brother too often um he does live in town um but usually is either at work because he works full time then he has he is a part time student an columba state u so i do not really see him during the day and then at night he usually goes out and does his thing i go out and do my thing so i mean as far as what is going on with him i really do not know but it i know i mean there is nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that

um-hum 

Recording: (8503/ 9620) 
u like i am a pilosophy miner so like if you look at like different ethical theories and stuff like you like there is a highorarky kind of this is what i have found there is a highorarky of things that are uh like the inalianable rights for instance like i can not if you come in o my house and rob me and then run outside i not gong a i do not like to kill you for stealing my property like there is a highorarky there uh for stealing another life that is why people say oh you can do it so but i really feel like there is notthing like if i if it is inalianable the definition is it is not able to be taken not even by yourself that is why you can not commit suiside and since it is the highest thing because without it you can not even do the other it is so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because with out that you can not do the you can not be ethical in any other way so that has to be the highest thing and if it is inalianable becaus is i did not give it to you i can not take it back you never forfitted that you never gave me that right so that is what i feel like i could never want that you know to kill another person or 

Recording: (8504/ 9620) 
but it kind of helps actually because uh you have all the people in there who are not oners and they do not know how to like the partiers they do not now how to study or anything so

eah it is like the uh the woman hat used to live in the apartment where we live before us see she had a husband that she was married to for quite some time he got on ohio is number onn d i list with eighteen dis and can you imagine how much money he is put into that i mean you think her first di affence would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend in jail or something but eighteenm and your racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time i think he is in jail now 

Recording: (8733/ 9620) 
civil rights u well i i take the extreme position that civil rights are an alusion u yeah they are on paper which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing when uh there were laws that restricted someone because of theire ethnic background or because of their gender but i think in many ways it has had little effect on creating and equal and fair society um ma ma maybe some many left is positions will lt come out right now um people have the freedom but i believe that based uppon where where in the social strattom you are born in the united states uh you have a a limited ability to move upward and that the these class i mean i do not want ta say classlines because that has so many like historical commutations because it is not the exact same as they class was in the markcis sens but classlines still today very much um follow race lines and what good is like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that is goin to buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort i mean in in real terms in things i think are valuable to the individual 

Recording: (8734/ 9620) 
yeah for everybody so it is kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest from from their families too so it is a first great grandchild and and with um my husband he is it is he is the oldest so for everybody

it is an iland but a plan it together i liked it there i kind of like i i figure they will probably hook up but i do not like how the show this show and this happened with deep space and i doi an even with next generation for a little bit how the shows become soap opera like um i mean the romantic aspects of the storie s do not really appeal to me very much um i am more interested in the social things i in you know good old special effects um but uh i i think i like that how it is kept with a sort of a tension and it is not like you know i mean they are not completely thrown together like uh bilana and tom whiti i do not like that at all 

Recording: (8739/ 9620) 
better than that much dirt <laugh> so uh whenever they we heard any firing like thit was coming toward us why we would head for that hol 

Recording: (8740/ 9620)

Recording: (8745/ 9620) 
totally left that part out no one fillte me in about no throwing up or anything that that really may mea a <laugh> 

Recording: (8746/ 9620) 
i jut think it is a different time now i do not think uh i think everybody is living more for a day been talking about the future you know hoping that the future is there i think there is uh quote onquote uh in time aspect of life you know 

Recording: (8747/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (8748/ 9620) 
okay good 

Recording: (8749/ 9620) 
like trying to cramb organic into my head and 

Recording: (8750/ 9620) 
ht did you spend much of your time doing besides snorkelling 

Recording: (8751/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (8752/ 9620) 
um 

Recording: (8753/ 9620) 
but you understand what i am sayin it is you are going to have to make make it so the guns that you hae got are harder to conceil 

Recording: (8754/ 9620) 
yeah 

Recording: (8755/ 9620) 
right right and that yeah and again if it is criminal activity you want om you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it is i i am not doing anything i want anybody to know about i i you know i mean whan s to prevent them from going in finding out what some company is doing what research es and that is a that is a threat on the web too is that you can connect into somebody is system and they do not know you are there and you can see what they are doing if they are doing research uh you know developing a new product or something you can you k it is corporate ecspou knowt and i am sure that is going on and i have heard cases of it yoea hn well and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they will find a way of you knowit nobody is found a way to prevent people from getting in and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

Recording: (8756/ 9620) 
but it it is teaching him discipline responsibility you can not do these things at this time you know i 

Recording: (8757/ 9620) 
i i am sure it makes it easier but i think that a person can establish a relationship you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working you know with my oldest daughter i worked but i aranged my life around her so that even thoug i had that degree i wait at tables because when she was little before she started school i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her with with her all day than when she started school i switched over to lunches and so i have always arranged my life around my children so i have an opportunity to be with them

right 

Recording: (8785/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8786/ 9620) 
um so i mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them i mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know <laugh> 

Recording: (8787/ 9620) 
no they should talk aout i think they should talk about that too um i never i never did it and i you know wish i could have waited so i was married but i you know you are going through that whatever you go through when you are a teen ager so you are like so wat whell most kids i am not you know some people just some kids still do that but i think i guess i do think they should put that in it also that 

Recording: (8788/ 9620) 
i work at uh company pluss i help out at the vv av it knowing butlern is association 

Recording: (8789/ 9620)

Recording: (8791/ 9620) 
everybody needs to know that information for credit cards 

Recording: (8792/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8793/ 9620) 
 

Recording: (8794/ 9620) 
now this most of my paintings were completed uh before uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before it came back out it was more of a thing like images from my childhood coming back out and now it is suddenly uh you hear about it more often so thats are not a little funny about it used to be probu like i w painte star wars 

Recording: (8795/ 9620) 
hih on their hors yeah <laugh> some of them are too 

Recording: (8796/ 9620) 
yeah i could i could imagine 

Recording: (8797/ 9620) 
i know exactly 

Recording: (8798/ 9620) 
uh-huh 

Recording: (8799/ 9620) 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they did not have any way to um enforce that so 

Recording: (8800/ 9620) 
hopefully 

Recording: (8801/ 9620) 
but now i kno i am definitely in favor of that i mean yes it is the parentis is up the parent is supposed to do it and one would hope that the parent would get there before wbefore the health classd 

Recording: (8802/ 9620) 
that is the way we figure in a few years he will be fine it is just getting there it is been very difficult i mean there is times when we did not know where he was for a week ora week at a time he i was driving lain avenue once and saw him beaging money on the street and tit is it is it is pretty heavy load to go through it really is 

Recording: (8803/ 9620) 
um 

Recording: (8804/ 9620) 
now 

Recording: (8805/ 9620) 
<laugh> 

Recording: (8806/ 9620) 
in the meantime you know <laugh> you got to pay the bills so i ou kno i am not sure what she wants to do she is had so many different kinds of jobs part time jobs though um you know i am when she was younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show 

Recording: (8807/ 9620) 
but you know with people coming back later and saying that uh they change their mind and stuff is the adoptive parents i would be concerned about that but that is not going ta happen in this case i do not think and because of her age and this makes nho sense to me the state law says that she has to have custady the child for seventy two hours before she can give it up for adoption uh because of her age and it does not make any sense to me but so that you knowthey are talking to a social worker now to find out they do not wan to take the baby home because they are afraid of being two attached to it then and they do not think it is a good atmosphere fort because her mother smokes constantly her mother is alcoholic uh they 

Recording: (8808/ 9620) 
because you do have to hive a higher education most of the time to do anything these days so they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (8809/ 9620) 
right 

Recording: (8810/ 9620) 
no 

Recording: (8811/ 9620)

Recording: (9036/ 9620) 
it is probably family by family i mean <laugh> that is why i was a little bit layte leaving work the way it was they are they are we have got too coworkers one um has her child it the same day care as as myself she is about a year now and and listening to her and i mean she is there you know sixty seventy hours a week i mean she is dropped off at six aem and not picked up till six thirty pm and she is fine with that me personally there is no way becaus somebody is totally in my opinion raising that child you are not getting to put your values your traditions what is important to you under that child now the other girl she just has a four month old and i is been in day care now for three weeks and she is going to go she is she is going to put her job and go to um um night working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him 

Recording: (9037/ 9620) 
so she so i probably did learn a little bit because i i she is still d she is lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so i have i have learned everything on my own uppon cooking and stuff like that which i love to cook 

Recording: (9038/ 9620) 
i think society u today up today is less tolerant of uh a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff you know and they are more vocal about it as opposed to being by ont atbut it back in the sixties and stuff you know uh not here but you know down south there are people still getting hung and stuff you know for being a black or something and uh you know there are bad blacks wand there are bad wites too you know so but not all of them are you know are that way 

Recording: (9039/ 9620) 
um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally number one it is really hard to and secondly it probably will not kill them like a gun can um and ou have to use your brain so i did not come from a hunting background um but my husband does work for the state higr patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns but none of them hardly any of them hunt um in a lot of them they respect them if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people where you do get some of the you know much ease mo people they just want to go out and shoot things and yeah yeah i i yeah i not it is not the guns that is the problem it is the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9040/ 9620) 
um so i am sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for

Recording: (9045/ 9620) 
and you register them and then you just keep after them you keep giving them inforemation and then you just run a good get out the vote campain uh yiu know ohio i think it is easier to do that because there is a law that i do nt think it is in primaries but in general elections at eleven oclock in the morning and four oclock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted they have ta put up a list of uh registered voters and cross out those who have voted so what i used to do was i took my list that i would gotten from th prt of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who would shown support or were it was un decided on the election and i would cross off vhose that had voted and then i had a list of vhose that had nt and i had people waiting at a phone bank ind i woul call them at work or at home and and i woud offer to take them to the pols if you do not have a ride uh we will take you to the pols if youare worried aboutyou know someon watching your kids we have sort of pi teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or we ill sit an your home and we wi vaby sit for you why you go to vote because i have also read studies that say people who are routed from thouar home we re their office you know knw reminded to go vote will also vot four whalt ever iss you were candidate has reminded them to do thatbecause what i did was is a very low kie thing i would call people on election day and say hi this ais wer bort i am calling t remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to extierc ise your mose importantfreedom which is to go vote and now by the way uh when you go t vo we hope that you will vote for such an such a school leviy and if youd yeed ta ride let me know we have got them set up for you and but you know that is very i mean and and that is not getting people to vote and incurige them to vote because they should that is a a special campaing for a particular issue ere a candidate i do not know how you get people to vote i do not know why they do not think it is import maybe because we have had it too easy my got my grandfather did not my grandfather did not i mean there wast a king an queen and you know he had no right to vote so t when he came here and he could that was the most important thing in the world to him you know and i he just passet on too you know his daughter my mother my father i do not know how he o it was important to him but was ares inportand to him and we talked about politics that tha dinner table some tims we talked t about issues and he said you know was important to to be heoard so i do not know if it was at it got passed on parent wise or what it was

actually they are they are working o than i am sory d meanon forfar a um they have they have um just in stat et some bones skeems where as the poverty let op level i think is considere them theirteen thousand pounds a yeare um and if if you are below the poverty level and you you go aback to worek you get a sortaen like ack sre bones beyond you know so there is a bonus for back to work you mentione arally are about like how this would affect the children with thi to your wellfere thing i mean at least i know a lot more about the system theire for for whatever reason then i do about this is tem here whith cind o n fortunate but um theire i mean i do not really think and a lot of situations of course i am sure theyire ar people who polly as hi shi be and who who really need it and who really you know ta can care of their tuhildren but un fortunately you do not really see that si very much you see the people who like theire kids see none of tha money you know they are left at home by themselves if if they can even you knw get them to school is they even go to school if they are yeven botheire you know and you know those you know a lot of they are they are j occou menturies on all the time theire so you really sort of it is more in your fa then an is hear that i ever knoticed um but i do think and and with that they have specific programs for the children and um i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know if a if e kid has bad behavior or you know bat tend ins thet you send them home i mean i think that s the mos redyiculous thing like surelly thats not up punisment for a lot of these kids and you know at leased in england on these things i have seen you know they send them home and these kids are just doing what ever going around the neghborhoold chopplifting ble ing you know a hot wiring cars t the age of you know ten are something and i do n know i think i do have sort ofvous trog apinions about people you know who are having all these kids ind or tate care of them at all

it it might i mean it good teachers do that i i i sti will get up sat when i was teaching school i wo did activity base teaching um and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools was suppos be one of the better schools in the area and i thought the would be all sorts of creative things going on and there was not it was still read the chapter rite the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought how boring i mean there i different ways to get kids turned on to things um i am not sure there is so much influence from the media uh and i say media broad base and you u be at print media or tv um that has this culture today uh ustars and you know media of um phenomenons and and they do not see the relevance and i do not think they hear from their parents like i did the importance of voting and that is whork coms from their parents do not vote so if their parents do not vote they ar no nh again i do not know what the the answer is um but it is very scary what is going ta happen in the next couple of generations the only good thought for me as i think about this is that i will not be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too i have great faith in democracy um there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if theire were an issue i think kids wol if if there were kids in college that weare being drafted in being sent to dy in a war that people did not think was important or had no real relevance to their lives i mean i think the kids would would rally immediately the issue right now is that there is nothing there

those are i ti phink you were implang these our needs to those people but they are not uh so howd we correct some of this we h gotto i think we have got to cut out a lot of this lucxury we have got to slowly bring quo tha family back home uh and i do not necessarily say it has to be the woman versous the man who cares and todays wear uh we are far less i ger culturally related uh we are fore more in service or indtation and manufacturing our intation uh so uh a man an ah ar wot me re frase a woman can do most of the work is being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as i wr cultural people uh and wonce again thegh that would bring people back to this central family make u just has to be communications ommunications has at is going h a it is ir reversible uh i think that can be re directed hand muct in the manner she is speaking uh and and where dijus start ithing ha start bac carent first grade i think parents must participate with teachers uh as we used to uht was just common uh you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participant wi participate and or assist ah what today they have these assistance but they are higred directed assistance they are not in their portraying or pascing their o thearvaluese of the community to the stons uh so i think that is i i guess i come i we will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has goti be com back the family bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis not that impersonal basis

Recording: (9309/ 9620) 
i think that is great you know i think obviously there is always a downsid and but i think that too many people abuse the system and you know unfortunately it is very hard when you know then it ruins it for the people who really dou need it and but you know as long as they have you know created a system whereby you know it will not be obviously is good for those people as it has been the onenes eho are denuinally unemployable but you know i think depending on how um sort of focus they are on the individuals in their area or whatever however it is divided up i do not now hopefully not special treatment but obviously you would try to steear them more in which ever direction the are most sueted for you know as vol as far as may be like the volunteer whork because i mean you know there is so much volunnteering to be done everywheare and even if you do not have you know if you are lacking in whatever way you think that you can you knw there is something you know hopefully that i do not know

why i mean it is part of the scripture that you say you believe and i undre percent than what nin youou kno an thit i you t talk about it and the problem is that they do not they do not know the answer and if theydo not know the answer if they can no giv a firm this is the answer then they avoid it i trying find i trind find form me what has be come the best answer you know if i do not if i dn not b if i do no believe something i do not know what to believe about something i will go and i will find an answer for myself i am not going to take somebody els is answer and if i do take someone else ers answre they beter be able to back it ut you know yeah yeah yeah yeahel i know a lot of people who do but i know a lot of people ho do um-hum uhum um to if theological discussions kno know unless unless you are seaking that out i mean i go to the vinyoard church it is up in it is up in uh um westervill and there is about there is about probably six thousand of us it is one of the biggest churches in ohio and um if you want tao find something and that whurch you can find it you can find a discussion group about anythin it is just a matter of finding it and withhin any within any dhe knoma ation or with hin any religion you goways deep is you wanna go you know there ara people who just go on sunday mornings there are people just go on easter there are people who go mond day whendsday tostayu nd somnday nights and saterday nights and i ari very very very into that a i mean i am not the monday tes ay whenstay thursday type but i am pretty involved i am pretty involved um-hum the community the community um the church is designd as the community of other christians it is not necessarily desind s um i heard this in ha serman this is really good um it is not designed o as the congeregation comes in and says way to go paster you go do it we are going to chear you wan the job of a christian isto go out and pread the gospl of jeasas christ that is the job of a christian and there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that is what the original you know that i what the that is what a christian is supposed to do and that is what our church does

Recording: (9398/ 9620) 
and that is what i am sayingn atoning for sinsit is quite a hipocracy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did i mean in the church in zansvill where i went and burried my grandparents and went through all my life over the door of the church is a picture of christofer colombas with a missionary a priest and all his men with his sord drawn a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear now i asked the priest cold hard question

no the life style was you know very easy to fit into and i whave always been you know interested ad and you know sort of liked the whole european culture um before i went there but i think the most difficult was actually because i was studying english when i went there and you know studying english here is at i am ad was and and studying english and a are and england is you know sort of i do not know more sort of alites which i did not realize before i got there so i was in all these courses i was the only american the classes were really small and it was you know you i definitely got a feeling and i it there were a few classes that really stood out where you know there was sort of you knw yould i would have to say something or i would have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like you know wut what thi this american know and you know it was that was the hardest thing is the way i was treated by some of my um peears ing classes i mean not directly theywold never say anything terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of you know that feeling of

Recording: (9461/ 9620) 
yeah that is what it seems i mean i i know it is like i mean it is the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but uh it just seems more apparent just because of how you can like go outside all the time yeah i mean there is never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and

but we still need to have property management records hit is very essential and a lot of times when you are talking to engineers they do not realize that part of it uh they do not like the detail at least that aspect of it uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how uh your uh facilities are structured uh the time history any type of uh activity on that whether it is been uh installed removed relocated whereit might be but we nee to know that how it ha impact upon the design of a particular uh facility voice end data
