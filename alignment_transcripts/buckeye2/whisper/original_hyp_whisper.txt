========== TRANSCRIPTS =================

Recording: (1/ 9621) 
 Arrangeo, you know. 

Recording: (2/ 9621) 
 That's 

Recording: (3/ 9621) 
 What was it like down there? 

Recording: (4/ 9621) 
 That's almost worse though, that it's not even a surprise. 

Recording: (5/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6/ 9621) 
 Well, my grandmother was ill. 

Recording: (7/ 9621) 
 Three out of my four children do belong to the Catholic Church, and then my one daughter chose, living in Oklahoma, she is in a Baptist church, but she's very active within the church, very active through the Sunday school. 

Recording: (8/ 9621) 
 Right, but the ones that are racing are the ones that are the standards in the fields. But more and more of those are also available on the web, but you have to subscribe to them. So it's still an institutional subscription. I mean, that's a constant problem for the cereals people everywhere. It's incredible what's happened with the costs. I mean, I've seen articles that say some of them have gone up $1,000 a year. 

Recording: (9/ 9621) 
 But what does it tell us about our people? We're so naive. We've got to look inside ourselves and say, what can we bring to society that could be more beneficial? And most of the time, it's listening. 

Recording: (10/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (11/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and it makes it fun so you can actually see what your studying these teams does. You can go a whole season 17, 18, and 0, and nobody's pretty much coming close to your standard. When you win all that money, it's just like, yeah. When you lose all that money, it's like, that's it, I'm going home. But I've known people that gamble compulsively. I mean, it's like a Gambler's Anonymous level. I couldn't really get into that. Number one, I'm not the richest person in the world. And number two, just a little money here is one thing thing but when you're out there spending your car insurance money on it or rent money then you got a real problem there. I've seen guys do that too. Go down to Syota Downs and bet the farm on one horse and wouldn't even do anything for them. 

Recording: (12/ 9621) 
 I've learned a lot about cooking lately. 

Recording: (13/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (14/ 9621) 
 So just trying to take my time, do what I want to do. Yeah. 

Recording: (15/ 9621) 
 I'm a senior and I just started my art major in spring, so I still have about four quarters left. But I am a senior. 

Recording: (16/ 9621) 
 Hediye etsene. 

Recording: (17/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's projected like six years to finish some of these projects. It's unreal. Well, I know when we drove through Georgia, you actually see people working on the road. There's a whole bunch of people, and they're all out there working. And you get to Ohio. There's a, I don't know, something on David Letterman had a picture of this, and I think I've seen it before. That big sign that says, your tax dollars at work. And there's the construction guy smoking a cigarette, leaning up against the side kind of thing. It's like, great. It was kind of funny. 

Recording: (18/ 9621) 
 It's just the way it is, I guess, but it's like, you know, she says, if the mother's in the house, the mother's on duty. 

Recording: (19/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (20/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (21/ 9621) 
 Right, right. But at least we had the stuff outside to look at to keep us interested. And there was a lot of... I've always loved to travel by car. Yeah. It's fun. And it's probably because of that early conditioning. I've been in 48 states. 

Recording: (22/ 9621) 
 No, it was his mom ran away is what happened. 

Recording: (23/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, by the way, 

Recording: (24/ 9621) 
 Pfft. 

Recording: (25/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's curious, isn't it? 

Recording: (26/ 9621) 
 I don't think it's really something that they need to really to do to it. They'll come by it. I mean, actually, I mean, I could see that they could at least take the money from it and put it to better use of some sort if they did the same kind of thing. 

Recording: (27/ 9621) 
 because not only is he a chauvinist pig, but he's a bigot too. A racist. Yeah. So 

Recording: (28/ 9621) 
 All you do is you just keep your records of what you spend on things. And then there's a form you fill out and how much you have, if you've taken any depreciation, you need to basically put that back in and deduct your cost. And then there's a percentage that goes on your Schedule E that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income. And then it's just taxed. It's really not that hard. 

Recording: (29/ 9621) 
 I hope they keep it. 

Recording: (30/ 9621) 
 He's lying. 

Recording: (31/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I really, really hate the fact of government telling me what to do. 

Recording: (32/ 9621) 
 I must have been thinking the freshman class just ride along. I think the freshmen would be a little bit tougher. It'd be tougher to be walking around in different areas. Like me, I didn't know where this hall was. I was out there with 50 million halls around me. And just stopped once, and I said, where's Lazenby? And they went that way, not too far from where I parked. 

Recording: (33/ 9621) 
 And that's the way I felt about it. I'm not saying that that's not a possibility, but... 

Recording: (34/ 9621) 
 it will make the catalogs real small and we have like five hundred thousand things and what the catalog has like a hundred of them and that's really annoying to then people call up with all these like things that we like don't know if we have our computers are really really old it's like an old style mainframe 

Recording: (35/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (36/ 9621) 
 I tell you it's mine now. 

Recording: (37/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah, exactly. I was just wondering how can I get a job doing what you're doing? 

Recording: (38/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (39/ 9621) 
 or take me to court again. They got the money, I don't. 

Recording: (40/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (41/ 9621) 
 Yes, she believes all men will cheat. 

Recording: (42/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (43/ 9621) 
 So were you thinking of going somewhere else like an Ivy League school or something like that? So how did you find out about the program? My counselor just kind of found it and he had posted it and he especially Tried to notify the National Merit people about it And I was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school They all one of them's at Princeton right now. You know, they're all off at their Ivy Leagues Like basically working their butts off to get in when I'm already in I don't totally understand it 

Recording: (44/ 9621) 
 Well, it 

Recording: (45/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (46/ 9621) 
 It's all over. They contract with Dominion Homes and Dominion is, seems like it's going up everywhere, and M.I. So they're all over. They have projects all over. 

Recording: (47/ 9621) 
 She just wants to get it over with. 

Recording: (48/ 9621) 
 even harder. 

Recording: (49/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's 70 years old. 

Recording: (50/ 9621) 
 and they're not accurate. 

Recording: (51/ 9621) 
 I know, I don't, I do not want to go, I don't want to touch the computer when I go home. 

Recording: (52/ 9621) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (53/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, yeah, and I think even if you're aware of everything that's here, you still, in the back of your mind, you just have that, it's just Columbus, it's just Columbus. Maybe it's because people don't take advantage of, don't realize what's actually here. Don't realize how it, I mean, yeah, it's not Chicago, it's not New York, it's not San Francisco. There's a lot of places it's not. But it's not a backwater either. Well, they need to get out more. I mean, all this, oh, we'll never be a major league city until we have major league sports. Well, you know, I guess getting out more wouldn't help those people. That would be such a small part of civilization anywhere for me. And I'm pretty pleased with the way things are moving along and I just, I really do think people don't take advantage of it the way they should. 

Recording: (54/ 9621) 
 Really, I think it's really good for women to learn about this. We should have known about this 20 years ago. All these women, I know. 

Recording: (55/ 9621) 
 So she's very limited on working in closed corners and stuff like that. So she's basically disabled. And that goes, when they do that, it's because of your education. And also, they take in consideration everything. 

Recording: (56/ 9621) 
 which I think is kind of nice. So, I mean, it looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable. I mean, my biggest thing is I just want to have a room all to myself. You know, I don't want to go someplace where I'm going to have to, like, deal with somebody else in there. So, I mean, it looks nice, but I would be more comfortable at home, I think, once I go home. 

Recording: (57/ 9621) 
 I never learned math. We had in fifth grade, we had the principal realized that nobody knew their times tables. We had a big pizza party planned for 

Recording: (58/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (59/ 9621) 
 So any other impressions of Columbus? Impressions of Columbus. Well, number one, I didn't realize that it was as big as it is until I started working for the courier service. You know, I've heard people say, and I know it's true, that Columbus is one of the top ten largest cities in the United States. And I was like, you're kidding me, really? I started driving around and I'm like, yeah, it is. This place is huge. This place is absolutely behemoth. I mean, everything within 270, it's pretty darn big. And that was really surprising. I love, I just love living in a big city. It's just, it's just everything is so different than living in the country. I miss the big expanses of grass out in the country, but I can skate all over the place here in town, which I can't do at home. I mean, I could skate on our driveway, but it stops abruptly in stones, so it gets real boring. I mean, going downhill is really fun, but going back up is a pain in the neck. But there's a lot more people here. I like lots of people. I've discovered I like having lots of people around, meeting all sorts of new and interesting and unique people. And every year there's a whole new crowd of freshmen that come in, new people coming and going. Postdocs like me coming and going. I'm only going to be here for a year or so. Really? think tank. The Republican think tank. So aside from the college, the town is pretty much agricultural. I don't know why anybody would want to live there unless they're raising a family. Because if they're raising a family, it's a great place. Great community. Great all around for raising a family. No. No, I want to find someplace similar to that. I want to find someplace similar to that in Colorado Yeah, I love Colorado beautiful state got some good skiing Yeah Skating skiing, that's how I did this Tore my ACL two years ago, Christmas, day after Christmas. It's a tendon right in the front of your knee that keeps your knee from moving out and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous twisting and turning positions that it's not really supposed to. But I ripped that right in half. So what would you do to improve Columbus? Well, for one, this place is dirty as crap. It's just so 

Recording: (60/ 9621) 
 Well, I often have to write on papers. I believe you turned in the wrong paper. I believe I got the rough draft instead of the final copy. Do you have the final copy somewhere at home? 

Recording: (61/ 9621) 
 Yeah, Ellen at Lane Avenue has been a big booster of my work. I mean, I was really lucky to run across her. 

Recording: (62/ 9621) 
 It does. 

Recording: (63/ 9621) 
 And he couldn't have any kind of caffeine, otherwise he'd get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills. 

Recording: (64/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so that's taking some running around. 

Recording: (65/ 9621) 
 I think some of it was that I think a lot of it is you do feel lonely you do go through a period in your life where You don't feel like you have any friends or you feel totally different. I mean I still go through that I think we all go through that at some point rather even yearly for some of us So I'm just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody either in his family, I say he using those for example, or the parents paid a little bit more attention and didn't have that blind eye, I think that's part of your responsibility as a parent that if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your child's eyes, you need to really admit it. I mean you don't want to do that. 

Recording: (66/ 9621) 
 No. No, I'm interested. 

Recording: (67/ 9621) 
 the lower grades. We have a few male teachers at first grade and fourth grade, but not many. But I think that young men, young boys would do better in a setting in school if they had a man earlier on, rather than having to wait until they're in middle school to relate to a coach. And up until then, it's always been a woman. 

Recording: (68/ 9621) 
 and this one could die, so. 

Recording: (69/ 9621) 
 좋아 

Recording: (70/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (71/ 9621) 
 You know, my daughter, you know, there's just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and I'd call up to the school and, you know, the principal like, he'd say, Miss, you know, I'm, I am her last chance. You know, my daughter was going to summer school every summer. And he's like, Mrs., you know, she's she's like you know the average student. She's the type you know that she's going to get you know she's going to get through college you know she's just one of those you know that just moves right along. You know she's not the brightest you know but she's bright enough. Those are your average professional people out working today. I was just like, well, I just want more help for my daughter. I just want somebody to jerk her down. 

Recording: (72/ 9621) 
 That's great. 

Recording: (73/ 9621) 
 They just called me on the phone not knowing, you know, just that she went to the hospital. Well, they said to me, will you stay? Well, I said yes, but then when it got into two weeks and I wasn't getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything, it's like, I'm sorry, I'm a substitute. Substitute, I'm getting $60 a day. I can't do this unless, you know I have more help and I just flatly said that I'm sorry I mean if I did if it was my own job I would have struggled with it, but it was not my own job, and I didn't know what was gonna happen So if they would have gotten some help in there for me I would have stayed perhaps, but no I You know you can work for underpay and understaff and you can't do everything. 

Recording: (74/ 9621) 
 threatening her and stuff like that and uh, which all I'd have to do is get on the phone and sit there and say, you know, I can be out there in about two hours, you know. So I don't know what your problem is, but you need to get you to talk to me about it. Talk to your mom about it. Go see somebody else and talk to him about it. 

Recording: (75/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (76/ 9621) 
 and decide to go back for their jobs. If you notice, the first time that they voted, they voted down this proposal. The proposal that they're voting on this week is the exact same one. 

Recording: (77/ 9621) 
 And I'm just using that as an example. I mean, your other drugs, I don't know much about them. 

Recording: (78/ 9621) 
 They could do it. My one granddaughter, they live in Springfield. They just moved to Springfield and she goes to kindergarten. Only a half day. And this child is only five years old. He has them reading the newspaper, watching the news. She told me a story about Christopher Columbus discovering America that was so deep and intense I couldn't believe it was coming from a five-year-old. So this is what the teacher is doing down there. 

Recording: (79/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (80/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (81/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (82/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (83/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (84/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (85/ 9621) 
 No, there was a lot of conflict at home. My dad had to support us. There were four of us and our mother has disabilities. And she was kind of crazy. 

Recording: (86/ 9621) 
 I think it's probably too though that a lot of people aren't used to it. I mean they're not from Ohio. I've found that in Columbus a lot. So they're kind of more tentative or they're from the south or something like that. So then you run into a lot of people that are from Ohio. But I've noticed that a lot of people rarely do you meet people born and raised in Columbus. 

Recording: (87/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay, that was easy. 

Recording: (88/ 9621) 
 And he's real because people give him that. 

Recording: (89/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (90/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (91/ 9621) 
 So basically, well yeah it might work, but to me it's kind of stupid, you know, because what you're saying is we're going to take this law and we're really going to stick you on this law, but to hell with all the other laws. So is that really fair? 

Recording: (92/ 9621) 
 That's great. 

Recording: (93/ 9621) 
 I was alright. 

Recording: (94/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (95/ 9621) 
 Hell. 

Recording: (96/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (97/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (98/ 9621) 
 He's a subcontractor. If someone's got a job to do at their house, he'll do it. We just went and tore the cabins out of a house that was on fire because of the smoke damage. 

Recording: (99/ 9621) 
 the hours with, because Jason works during the day too, so it would probably work out pretty well for us. 

Recording: (100/ 9621) 
 All of his problems have been personal problems that really shouldn't have been touched on except the media got into it. I mean, we look up to the president to be a moral man, whatever, but if you look at the other nations, they weren't that shocked that a president would do something like that. 

Recording: (101/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (102/ 9621) 
 Boy, that's a really tough one. I hadn't thought about that. And high school kids are so touchy about, I mean, touchy about sexual identity and so insecure in their own that they're really likely to come down hard on somebody who has a different orientation. And I don't know. I don't know. 

Recording: (103/ 9621) 
 I went to just a little Easter here in high school. 

Recording: (104/ 9621) 
 He works in a factory. 

Recording: (105/ 9621) 
 All those years after I left at school here was that the Bureau of Employment Services I worked like 20 years with Research and statistics labor market information federal state programs collecting information on three different programs in that time Then I worked for about a year and a half on a special project They were automating the employment services activities and they were going a completely different direction to match job needs of employers and applicants to get more placements for interviews and that sort of thing. And I developed that method, the mechanism, the checklist and stuff. I worked on that. And then I worked for the last three years in jobs training for economically disadvantaged youth, adults, and dislocated workers. 

Recording: (106/ 9621) 
 And one of them they looked at in Columbus was how well he was doing in school. Well, children have one of the highest dropout rates in schools. They're not doing well. So they need to be taught differently. And then they cut this money. My feeling is there's a lot of programs in school that's sponsored by the federal government, particularly, to help the students that are behind. And that's important. 

Recording: (107/ 9621) 
 when they're giving a $4,000 or $5,000 a year to someone who's making $200,000 or $300,000. I don't care if I get $5,000. That won't even buy me a tank of gas today. Keep the money and do something good with it. 

Recording: (108/ 9621) 
 Have you ever had a concern that you in the box spring on the floor. And I've got like comforters on the side of the bed. So because he's like, he like get out. He is like, I don't want to be in the bed with these guys. And he'll get on the floor and he'll sleep on the comforters on the floor, but he's close and he's happy that way. 

Recording: (109/ 9621) 
 Yes, hopefully. 

Recording: (110/ 9621) 
 You have a preference at five or six, but by the time you turn eight, one of your hemispheres has pretty much decided it's going to be the one that runs the show. Well, then that's when those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture. So, hmm? 

Recording: (111/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (112/ 9621) 
 hahahaha 

Recording: (113/ 9621) 
 I travel, traveling's been all I've, even for the transportation term, I travel across the state and country and before that I was always traveling. We took two weeks off when we go back to fall semester, back time of semester, not quarters. And we get on a Greyhound bus, $50 pass was, and Buddy and I would just travel all over the country and sleep in the bus at night. 

Recording: (114/ 9621) 
 And it's wild, it just seems like the music hasn't gone anywhere, because they keep going back to the 70s, you know, the Rolling Stones go touring, or Pink Floyd, or you know, these are groups from back then. Where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people? They're not there, you know. And the quality of the music just must not be there. My daughter's into the Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, all of a sudden now we're starting to get into some of that. That's starting to get a little interesting too as far as music choices and wanting to listen. Get them the Sony Walkman and then you don't have to listen to it. They didn't have that when we were kids probably. I remember our car had an AM radio in it and that was it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On an album. And now the kids are like, I want the CD, put the CD in. Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (115/ 9621) 
 in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents. So I did that until I came to a company that I stayed with for seven years and then they relocated to Dallas. So yeah. 

Recording: (116/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (117/ 9621) 
 Yeah. And it's like number one in the union. And that's like such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone's life and be like, oh, our bad. That person was innocent. You know. 

Recording: (118/ 9621) 
 Ha! 

Recording: (119/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (120/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (121/ 9621) 
 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 

Recording: (122/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (123/ 9621) 
 And why? What? He's too busy? 

Recording: (124/ 9621) 
 That's what I'm talking about. 

Recording: (125/ 9621) 
 You know, ain't no way in hell you'd have one nowadays. 

Recording: (126/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (127/ 9621) 
 He has the most experience. 

Recording: (128/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (129/ 9621) 
 Because they bypassed me and straight, ma, ma, ma. 

Recording: (130/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my parents live in Akron, like north of Akron, Kygo Falls area. But like I said, I had an apartment down there, but for the summer I'm down here. So I'm a transient, always moving my stuff. 

Recording: (131/ 9621) 
 You know, decide where you're going. Why do you just waste all your time running around like that? 

Recording: (132/ 9621) 
 So he did it. Well, he's always had some problems. His problem is staying focused on things, unless it's something he's extremely interested in, then you can't get him away from it. If it's something he'd be, it's just an example, in school he would sit there and he'd be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they're trying to teach something in class or working on a writing assignment or something. They had a half hour to work on it. For the last five minutes, the teacher said, you know, you really need to get that done. He'd sit down and write it. In the fifth grade, he was writing on a college level and he could do it that quickly. I think he's lost ground on that now. And that was just an example. In the second grade, the school he went to was an open classroom. And he had been through a couple of traditional schools already. And the principal said, we talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him, staying focused. And she said, well, we can work with that. Well, how about halfway through the year? She said, it's not working. And they have an arrangement with, and I doubt if most of the parents in the school are even aware of this, with Children's Hospital Counseling Center. They set a room aside, and they send counselors in once a month to work with the students. It's an open classroom. It's experimental. So there's people coming and going all the time. And we were never aware of it. I doubt if most of the people are aware of it. And they met with us, and then a week later they went and observed him. And he was, they were, the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about it. And he said he was, the counselor said he was up and walking around and running around and playing with his shoes and stuff like that. She said, but it came time to answer the questions. He knew every answer. So he said, they decided not to proceed at that time because this is frustrating too. It was our wedding anniversary and my wife said, now how about for our wedding anniversary we just get a good report for the whole week. That was unusual. And he wasn't a bad kid.

 and a lot of them has been getting off the hook lately. You see this guy on hard copy. He killed this woman's husband because he was in love with her and they ended up letting him go because he was supposedly incapable of making his own decisions. Now, I think that there's things in your brain that trigger ideas and if you have a wide you know wider version of What they I don't know what they call it. It's in that magazine there what triggers the violence and violent thoughts People actually do think more about the violence when they commit it than the accidental, you know. Some of it's mindless, some of it's not, but everybody thinks. 

Recording: (140/ 9621) 
 Professors, yeah, well, as I mentioned a while ago, I happen to have, I'm one of 15 siblings. 

Recording: (141/ 9621) 
 It's a great experience. Even when we were having problems with him and stuff, it was great. He couldn't understand. My wife once told me, she says, you know, something about spending time together. She said that there is no time that we spend with you that's wasted. And he couldn't understand that. She said, you mean this is fun? I said, I didn't say it was fun. 

Recording: (142/ 9621) 
 Right.

 It has a large gate. It does. 

Recording: (148/ 9621) 
 No, they thought it was, my dad told me later, he thought I was getting sent off just by myself, you know. 

Recording: (149/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (150/ 9621) 
 And outside of English, French is a horribly popular language for different countries to have as a second language. So I think it would be extraordinarily useful to me now if I had a greater understanding of French. 

Recording: (151/ 9621) 
 Well, they always did because the first time I had one I was 36 years old. 

Recording: (152/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's very, my sister has an undergrad in psychology and she worked at like one of those, what do you call those, secretive houses like for women and their badder children that you know, you're not supposed to know the location and whatnot. And she used to get so frustrated because they'd always go back.

 I was a teenager anyway.

 That's it.

Recording: (161/ 9621) 
 Or... 

Recording: (162/ 9621) 
 So that's where she went to high school and everything But I know I never went out there my extra-ass family here so she comes back a couple three times a year and I generally try to hook up with her and It's been a while but that she got older, you know, she wants to be with with her Playmates and everything as they get older, you having went through that myself, I understand that. So it got kind of rough to have her here for a couple, three weeks or a month or something like that during the summer. 

Recording: (163/ 9621) 
 you know, talk to her, but people don't, when I was 14, I didn't care what anybody told me. I was going to do it no matter what. 

Recording: (164/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm actually like a month older than him. 

Recording: (165/ 9621) 
 I don't know where he got the contact, but anyway, he went up to Boone, Iowa and joined a National Guard outfit, which was field artillery, and with the expectation of their being mobilized soon, which they were. And so he was home one weekend and talked to me about it, and I thought, well, field artillery, I was exposed to that when I was in ROTC at Ames. So I thought, let's be better than carrying a rifle. So I went up with him and I joined up. So anyway, we had six-inch howitzers, which had a range of about 16 miles, and the shells were about 95 pounds. 

Recording: (166/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (167/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (168/ 9621) 
 I got a bad heart, I don't know what that'd do to me.

Recording: (171/ 9621) 
 they find out a way to get to him. And I dated a guy where we came in on his little brother and he was loading the bullets in the gun. And he had them totally separate like that. And kids know and they're curious. I don't know. I mean, I'm not for guns because the guns don't scare me, the people scare me. So, no. Unless they have them in a safe or something. I just... That protection, like they said, normally you use it against somebody you didn't mean to use it on. And if somebody else comes into your house with a gun, let's face it, are you gonna have the peace of mind to go get it? I'd rather just have a bat by my door or something. So...

 Because that's like me, I watch the Three Stooges and you don't see me putting no crowbar up nobody's nose. 

Recording: (175/ 9621) 
 Right, right. That's the amazing thing about this country is that there's enough space in the United States and North America that you can have all these incredible monstrosity developments and still be able to find relatively wild places between them. Yeah. 

Recording: (176/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (177/ 9621) 
 I come back and it's just...

Recording: (179/ 9621) 
 Even Republicans were like that. 

Recording: (180/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, cuz I couldn't imagine rolling over on 

Recording: (181/ 9621) 
 I got into painting somewhat recently. I've always done a lot of art. My mom is an elementary school art teacher, so I was always exposed to art as a child. I did pretty good, too. But I never got into painting. It was mainly drawing, that kind of thing. And just three or four years ago, I thought, I'm going to learn how to paint, and I learned how to paint. 

Recording: (182/ 9621) 
 Great. 

Recording: (183/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I have read that. I need to try that. Just for winter, even. 

Recording: (184/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, that was a job, helping them to move. 

Recording: (185/ 9621) 
 Well yeah, under certain 

Recording: (186/ 9621) 
 No, no, but that's what I'm saying. But that's what I'm saying. The same thing is happening when we had a bus thing. We took kids out of the poor environment and put them in a nice environment. Oh, they got the taste of it and then went back home. And we did a very unjust thing to those kids and to the families. And then when we broke them up, we did something else. We lost that community involvement. So now the parents can't follow their kids to their activities. Again, splitting it up. Hey, we don't want families. That's a misnomer. They said the community raises the family, the kids. Yeah, that's how they want you to think. But the community will not replace the family. 

Recording: (187/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (188/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (189/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (190/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I hate that like all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter 

Recording: (191/ 9621) 
 Well, and. 

Recording: (192/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (193/ 9621) 
 It's the way I feel. 

Recording: (194/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (195/ 9621) 
 right after high school. I think there was probably, I'll say six. And amazingly, well, three were still together. 

Recording: (196/ 9621) 
 But they all look alike. 

Recording: (197/ 9621) 
 No, no, but. 

Recording: (198/ 9621) 
 Janet, we just had a man who took time to show us. 

Recording: (199/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (200/ 9621) 
 Aww, that's nice. Yeah, I'm sure. 

Recording: (201/ 9621) 
 Eh. 

Recording: (202/ 9621) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (203/ 9621) 
 They stopped federally funding OSU. That was a federal control tower and they contracted it out. So you either lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on. And you know, some people move like to Arizona and California. And I thought, well, since I only have like two and a half years until I retire and I really like Columbus. And I thought I don't want to uproot my daughters out of school and leave and start over. So I thought, well, I'll just go to Port Columbus and suffer it out until I can, 

Recording: (204/ 9621) 
 So I guess, I mean, that was really, really hard for me. I would call all my family members. I had family members coming over to try to figure out what this child needed. But I don't know. I couldn't tell you what he went through with that crying spell, but he did go through that, where he just did not quit crying. 

Recording: (205/ 9621)

 Bye. 

Recording: (209/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I really think both of them will be good parents someday. But she says, we're not ready. 

Recording: (210/ 9621) 
 My dad seems to think I should go into law because there's law in everything. You can do anything with a law degree. 

Recording: (211/ 9621) 
 Well, personally, I voted that the 33 should pass. I think they should. The way I understood, they have ways of wording those things, but you have to read it very carefully to know whether you should say yes or no on a thing. I said yes because I analyzed it to say that they're repealing something that was passed, I think, one or two years ago that was allowing things to be done up around the Polaris area, like new roads and and this and that and I want that repealed because I don't think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things. 

Recording: (212/ 9621) 
 Oh my god. 

Recording: (213/ 9621) 
 They just like it a little less or dislike it a little more when it looks like it's gonna come to something. It feels like they're trying to tease me as an audience and that's not something I feel teased by particularly. 

Recording: (214/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (215/ 9621) 
 Kind 

Recording: (216/ 9621) 
 couldn't even think about asking. 

Recording: (217/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I thought in the beginning I missed mirror Lake cafe so bad said the good subs and all that I don't I don't know why I missed them. I don't I go back and I just don't like it anymore

 Yes.

 whenever he runs. Well, I thought he was going to be elected mayor too, but he didn't there, but I don't know what that was about. But, you know, he's got his constituents and they're going to re-elect him because he stands up for the minority. I think what he makes a mistake is labeling things racist that are not necessarily racist, but anyway. 

Recording: (220/ 9621) 
 We are. 

Recording: (221/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's just like having alcohol around. I mean, gambling is a lot like alcohol. It can be addicting, it can screw your life up, and you'll spend your last dollar on it if you're that far gone. So pretty much anything can be one of those factors. 

Recording: (222/ 9621) 
 um... Irish people adopting like Italian babies or something like that. I mean it's no different. I mean as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from. I mean I can't see it being a problem of any sorts. I mean just as long as they have someone that cares for the kid and does stuff for him. I mean I can't see it being any 

Recording: (223/ 9621) 
 I personally agree with that, but that's just from my own moral beliefs and everything. But I don't know. I don't think that there's one solution that will fit every child in every situation. I mean, my husband had his daughter when he was 17. So, you know, obviously, he said his dad told him about condoms, you know, so they're going to make that decision on their own. I'd say just, and plus with the internet and everything, they have access to so much information. I think that it falls back on the parents still. If you're going to be a parent, you need to be responsible. And I don't think that it's getting done. 

Recording: (224/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (225/ 9621) 
 Um, in general, I think, I think the United States has a fairly well developed, like, class, not like class structure in which you can't move up or down, but like we have a fairly large middle class. 

Recording: (226/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and... 

Recording: (227/ 9621) 
 lower that's right yeah 

Recording: (228/ 9621) 
 You know what I mean?

 Um up until March he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home and then my grandfather who's 95 got ill and my aunt had to choose between my son and my grandfather and um she's watching actually my grandfather's doing quite well now but she um watched him so we now have him in a daycare um in Hilliard

 Well, you've seen people driving the wrong way on a freeway, right?

 But you know, and years ago, it's kind of funny, we seen each other and everything and then at some place down in East Sedona. I remember that time, I said, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (233/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (234/ 9621) 
 You just get the booklets, you call, you ask the questions.

 Not really, no.

 Yeah.

 Aw, isn't that cute? 

Recording: (238/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

Recording: (241/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (242/ 9621) 
 Thank you, Lizzie. 

Recording: (243/ 9621) 
 She's pretty nice, I mean, she's definitely least standable. 

Recording: (244/ 9621) 
 And then, like, let's see, a lot of it was, I mean, most of it was, like, pre-labor, and then there was the breathing that we did at the end, but other than the video, it was mostly, like, labor-related. 

Recording: (245/ 9621) 
 just how 19, 18 year old people are on the phone. It's really funny compared to, it's funny too when you can tell kind of like what people's backgrounds are and what kind of like their job is just by their, like how they conduct themselves on the phone. People, you know, especially people who can tell when they've been in the military, like they say like Alpha, Bravo, stuff like that for the letters, like they spell everything out and they say like, like, ah for zero, sometimes I have people do that and they're like, yes sir, no sir, like that. Or just when people call, a lot of people call from New York who are Arab, or, and they're like, those people are so aggravating, they're like, I don't know what to say if I want this. I saw stereo in store. I like. And it's like, man, I don't know what you're saying. And it's real funny too when, like, I don't know. Oh, yeah, like when they're in New York and it's all real loud and there's like cars and sirens in the background and stuff. Or when people, like this lady asked me, she was telling me about, she was getting like some bedroom set or something like that, like some sheets or something, and she was like asking me if it would go with her wallpaper and stuff, and she was like, she was like describing it to me, like, alright, this has a green trim with like a flower's design. She was like, do you think this like blue will accent it or something? And I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever, like, 

Recording: (246/ 9621) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (247/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry, I said that to mean anything. 

Recording: (248/ 9621) 
 Well, I have I have two uncles that are Southern Baptist ministers And used to be when we would visit them in the mid-60s we would have to go I mean if mean, if you visit your relative, if your relatives visit and you're a minister, you have to go to church. But the thing is, is Southern Baptist service always has that period where you're 

Recording: (249/ 9621) 
 I don't think so. In New York it might be. Like I say, it's a lot more competitive there. Here, I think Columbus is, and the Midwest in general, I think is much more open. 

Recording: (250/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there's some people there just get lazy. Then you got the college students. I don't know how many of them work, but most of them there's just from out of town. 

Recording: (251/ 9621) 
 No, it's just a regular old rent-a-cop with his own van. He'd hop in, I'll give you a ride, and drove me to the corner of the middle of nowhere in accordance to where I live. And then I had to walk all the way home. 

Recording: (252/ 9621) 
 One of the requirements is we have to be in the Honors College during undergraduate and fulfill all the requirements there.

 Never thought he was any better than anybody else. He was always there to help out if he could. But then some people, like you say, some people weren't that way. 

Recording: (254/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, they were more settled. 

Recording: (255/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. They're pretty good where I live. Last year, when we had that really, really high snow, I shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over. So it was like, what's the point? But our neighborhood has a lot of children, so most of the people do shovel their sidewalks. 

Recording: (256/ 9621) 
 She believes no man will love you so much not to cheat. And I don't believe that. So I'm not with her son. 

Recording: (257/ 9621) 
 They're fun. 

Recording: (258/ 9621) 
 I knew that kindergarten, because it's not required in the state of Ohio anyway, they really aren't required to be in school or enrolled in anything until they're six by September. When I found that out, I was like, oh, okay, cool. You know, I can keep him home. I mean, he could probably go into the second grade. I mean, he's very bright. He can read and write and add. So it's a challenge for me. 

Recording: (259/ 9621) 
 So I'm not going to get any fairness or justice out of that. But, uh, so they sent me the award saying that they sided in their favor and all that crap. Well, you know, fine. Um, but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna pay him until they contact me again. 

Recording: (260/ 9621) 
 It's funny because I studied Russian, but a lot of the people I served with were fluent in Spanish or something else. So it's like, I don't know why they got sent there. But it's, I mean, we really believe that it's inspired. They send your name and a picture and your application to the prophet who is the head of the church. And they pray over it, and they decide where you go. 

Recording: (261/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right. Yeah, we could put a little trailer there. We'd be outside most of the time anyway. 

Recording: (262/ 9621) 
 You know, it don't matter what they are. 

Recording: (263/ 9621) 
 It's not really an office. He's like a supervisor that just goes to the different job sites. He tells the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready. And then he gets to talk with the other contractors and he works together with them. But he's really just, there's a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites. 

Recording: (264/ 9621) 
 I don't know, she's getting a second child now. It's getting a little harder. 

Recording: (265/ 9621) 
 We'll try. 

Recording: (266/ 9621) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (267/ 9621) 
 I just hope he stays around. I don't know, maybe not, but I grew up without a father and I really have that against my father because he lived around us. He never called us, you know, and I really got resentment against him. 

Recording: (268/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you can't have a beer gut and a big ass. And it means you're sloppy and lazy if you do, but if a man does, it's like, my God, he's probably got some power behind him. And it's like, duh, he's probably just as lazy as anybody else. It's like, I hate to see girls starving themselves to death. It's like, there are certain times in your life where you're gonna be fat. My youngest daughter has a problem with that. I don't know why she's so insecure because she, out of the four of us, including her sister, is like right at the top. She has done television commercials, she's done radio voiceovers, she's been in plays. She was in a high school play when she was a kindergarten student and actually had a speaking part. I'm sitting there in the audience in tears. I'm like, why am I crying? a doing this. That's about how good I am in those. And she's just like, you know, and she's not a smart ass, you know, she doesn't show off, but she's just so relaxed doing this and it's, it looks so natural, but she doesn't see that. Cause you know, you know, she always thinks she's very mediocre. And I go, but you know, I said, you know, you've been in front of television cameras and you do so well. I said, you get on the radio, you do well. I said, you do well in school, you have a ton of friends. I said, you have a great body. I said, you know, I said, I never compare the two of them, but there are some times when I have to. I said, look at your sister. She has the same chest I do. I said, you definitely are well built there. I said, you have a nice shape. I said, when you have a bathing suit on, it's like, I go, somebody put a towel on her. You know, and I said, you know, you just don't realize all the physical and, and also the character attributes you have. I said, you have a great personality. I said, you go in a room of 100 people with me and your sister, and about three days later, somebody will go, John and Jelena who? But in 10 minutes, they'll go, where's Janelle at? Because they all know you. You're just so easy to get along with, and everybody likes you. And I said, you just don't realize this gigantic list of character, physical and mental traits you have that I can never even come close to having. 

Recording: (269/ 9621) 
 That's not because I'm skilled or anything, it's because when I was a kid my dad was crippled. I had to fix everything. 

Recording: (270/ 9621) 
 He's limited his meat a little bit more, but with men it's a lot harder. When they're used to meat and potato kind of families. But like Thanksgiving, it just doesn't mean that much to me. The family thing does, but the turkey, I don't cook it very often. My sister, we used to get it. 

Recording: (271/ 9621) 
 You're like, hell no, I'm not paying for those damn cats. You're like, honey, it's just a cat. You know, it's my baby. You can come home and visit at any time. I'm not paying. All right. 

Recording: (272/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (273/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there are times when, you know, just there's a group over there called Star Check. 

Recording: (274/ 9621) 
 I'm so sorry. 

Recording: (275/ 9621) 
 would you do? Oh God, I feel like I was a parent before I was a parent. That's the way it felt. Some of my friends, like this guy I used to hang out with, he used to run into lockers in high school. That is so kid. 

Recording: (276/ 9621) 
 And that type of person I don't think would make a very effective president because, I don't know, president needs to be able to think fast on their feet.

 That's Bishop Reedy. It's a Catholic school over on the west side.

 Yeah. Yeah, that's... 

Recording: (280/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (281/ 9621) 
 I think it fills its niche, you know. I mean, Wexner has a niche and the museum has a niche. And I think it fills it very well. 

Recording: (282/ 9621) 
 that so that if you if whoever won you know would get but we just went on field trips and had a great time it might be better now 

Recording: (283/ 9621) 
 He's going to be there all summer. I didn't decide I wanted to change it over until I got my scanner and found out that when I checked the website for the scanner that they're just simply flat out not making Windows 2000 drivers for my scanner. So it's a, crap, I don't know. I just got it. I can't even remember what it is. Um, pay per port, I think it's pay per port. Avoid Windows 2000 at all costs, stick with 98, much better, much better operating system. 

Recording: (284/ 9621) 
 don't go into elementary ed that much. 

Recording: (285/ 9621) 
 Well, I enjoy this. But it'll be impersonal because here you are. I can't face you. I don't know whether you're really kidding me and what you're talking about. I was sitting there in that street cafe or not. But I really do think we're going to be interconnected in that sense. And it becomes so much more impersonal. I guess I'm very strong about the term personal versus impersonal in any communications. And the bad that we've talked about I think will be a part of that 10 and 20 years from now, but I think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act, if you will. Going back to the political question, I think the financial things, I think we will start slowing that down. I think we'll have less influence in the terms of finances. I don't think we'll get back to Abraham Lincoln days, but if we can swing that pendulum back, I think we can, I think we will. I think we can do the same thing with communications. I think we can eliminate a lot of the bad, bad influences. I do know that over time, what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here. It's sort of like the definition of need versus luxury. Those definitions change. The definition of socialism and democracy, they slowly have changed over these times. Well, the same thing will be true with those. It's still functioning. Excuse me. And I think we will also slowly swing that pendulum on back to the and to the family again There are those doomsayers from my point of view are saying that In many years to come there won't't be such a thing as a family It's just you you go out here. You meet a an opposite sex you procreate and you go on your way She goes on her way and she's just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way Yes, a lot of that is true, but I think that I think that don't think that's going to ever happen. I think we'll turn that thing around. I think the so-called divorce rate program, as I talked about a while ago, every 50 percent of the people who marry within five years are no longer together. I think that will will change. And that is a very significant thing, I think, in terms of getting back to the basic family. 

Recording: (286/ 9621) 
 I feel like I should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting high. 

Recording: (287/ 9621) 
 Mmm 

Recording: (288/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure I'm ready to go back through all of that. 

Recording: (289/ 9621) 
 absent for the whole day, which would be considered truant. So they said what I had to do was go down to Juvenile, to this certain gentleman in Juvenile and have him file charges. So I took my son down to him and he said it was the school should have did that. So in the meantime, he's telling me that my son's getting ready to go to 11th grade and Neither side's gonna do anything about it Somebody should have did something about that because Then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to make him. You know get line. And so he knew he could get by with it. 

Recording: (290/ 9621) 
 And the fact that I recognized all that and couldn't wait to get out of there and when I was gone, I was gone. And even now we still have this ongoing thing where my family, in fact I've been real unhappy about them lately because we've lived in our same house for 20 years and my parents, they live in Florida. I mean they're not well to do by any means but they're not lacking, and they can afford to take plane trips, and they can afford to go to California twice a year to spend a week with my brother, et cetera, et cetera, and they come here a couple times a year, and they stay at my sister's house. They have only come to my home three times in 20 years, and it's because they don't want to get off the freeway. They will drive through Columbus from Florida to go to visit people in Akron and Maslin and they stay in Cincinnati and they stay in Springfield with my sisters and they won't do it because it's just too much. They don't want to have to deal with that traffic. They don't like that and it's and just recently I finally said you know I don't understand why you can't do that. You know I've actually called them on I'm 52. 

Recording: (291/ 9621) 
 I'd say there would be certain life application things that all kids should know, but not, I don't think that you can say everything, you know, you have, everybody has to do this because, you know, people are individuals and you have to take that into consideration, I think, so. 

Recording: (292/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (293/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was. 

Recording: (294/ 9621) 
 Why really think that's happening right now because I think that I don't know what the divorce Statistics have been recently But I do see that more people who are getting married are staying married because those that don't those that would have gotten a divorce They're not bothering to get married to begin with they're just living together and if they separate so what and I think that 

Recording: (295/ 9621) 
 I talk to him every now and then. 

Recording: (296/ 9621) 
 you know, white napkins, and, you know, we'd go there for lunch, you know, you'd dress nice and, you know, I liked that. And I would like, you know, my grandkids to be able to go downtown with me like that, you know, rather than have to drive off to a mall. 

Recording: (297/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that part was no different, man. 

Recording: (298/ 9621) 
 They had a 2 by 4 on the door for over a month. 

Recording: (299/ 9621) 
 Now that'd go over well here, wouldn't it? 

Recording: (300/ 9621) 
 So the crowd will. 

Recording: (301/ 9621) 
 I mean he would have been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there. And while I was down there he had me sleeping in a truck, a moving truck. And oh man it's a hilarious story. I mean 30 foot moving truck and I'm sleeping in it. 

Recording: (302/ 9621) 
 Now who does he work for? 

Recording: (303/ 9621) 
 And some of that's controlled with medication now, but not all of it. Because of the drug and alcohol, they won't put him on some of the medications. But as far as I can tell, he's been pretty clear and clean on that. And once she got pregnant, they both stopped smoking. She's taking very good care of herself. She lately has been going with him to the psychologist. And we've been paying for her, but we don't have a problem with that, because he's going. He likes the psychologist. So it took a long time to get to that point. So we've been talking to the psychologist about it. He said, most people that are raised in that background, he said, they go different ways. One, they just fall into the same pattern as their parents or their survivor. And she appears to be a survivor. She's never really had what I would call a normal family relationship. She likes to spend time with us, which I'm glad. And we really like her. We enjoy being with her, but sometimes more than being with my son. 

Recording: (304/ 9621) 
 So I try to gear what he watches towards educational programming instead of just junk. 

Recording: (305/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (306/ 9621) 
 and just took it and ripped it. 

Recording: (307/ 9621) 
 I don't know, it's possible, but I can't imagine it would... Not knowing how big it's going to get, I guess, I can't imagine. 

Recording: (308/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I don't want to get shot. 

Recording: (309/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (310/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (311/ 9621) 
 It's like down a hill kinda by the horseshoe, yeah. So that's where we go. And I don't have a student ID so I just sneak in. But it's the summer, they don't even care. They never. 

Recording: (312/ 9621) 
 I think they should. I think a lot of the fear of this material comes from people who hold the belief that you choose your orientation, that you can be converted to homosexuality. And I personally don't believe that, so I'm not afraid of it. But I can see how people would hold the opposite view, and that's where this comes from. But since I think they're wrong, I think it should be my way. And I think the material should be there. I think it should be dealt with in a calm and reasonable way and I think it should be accessible to the kids. 

Recording: (313/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, I heard something about that. 

Recording: (314/ 9621) 
 I retired about four years ago from the state. I worked there for 30 years. Actually, I started working for the state when I worked here. And that count, those five years counted towards retirement. So I was able to retire early. And then the last, about the last two and a half years I've been working at the symphony in the box office. Started part time and then I was full time for a while. And then I requested to be cut back to part time again. 

Recording: (315/ 9621) 
 I'm going to keep doing the same stuff. I'll find some other kids somewhere else. My husband and I will have time together. I always have a project. I'm always saying, well, when things slow down around here, like right now, I should be home counting money. I do the fundraiser for the school. We just sell Morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff. And our sales are anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. And so we get half of that for the profit. And I do that sale myself. But that also means that I have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile. But anyhow, I'm always saying, when it slows down, but then I always will find another project. And I rehab houses whenever I get a chance. I like to do that. 

Recording: (316/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (317/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (318/ 9621) 
 Okay. Is it like a kind of snobbish? Or are they... 

Recording: (319/ 9621) 
 I'm not really a big fan. I think one of the big problems is gonna be initially just the monetary thing of it. The people that supported the, basically supported the minor league teams that they had here, like blue collar people, you can go for 20, 30 bucks and have a good time, get drunk, throw a beer. And up there, you know, you're not gonna be able to do that. It's gonna cost you a minimum of 50 to $100 probably to take a family, a couple kids or something like that, you know. 

Recording: (320/ 9621) 
 or anything like that. I mean, that's something that I don't know, I'd sort of make known to them, but not something that I'd really push on them. 

Recording: (321/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (322/ 9621) 
 Actually, I... that's what got me interested, and so I went to library school and... 

Recording: (323/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (324/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he loves some chicken. He loves chicken. That's like his favorite food. 

Recording: (325/ 9621) 
 since I've been on both worlds. 

Recording: (326/ 9621) 
 It wasn't publicized to the degree that it is now. It seems like any more nothing is sacred, I mean, as far as the papers are concerned. And that's something else that I guess I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think we need all this publicity about all the sexual escapades of all the people that are notarized or have notarious lives. I just, I say maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I, and I can hardly conceive anyone being a genuine homosexual. I mean, evidently they are, but it's so against human nature, I think, or against conventional human nature anyway. 

Recording: (327/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (328/ 9621) 
 She helped a lot. 

Recording: (329/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (330/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (331/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (332/ 9621) 
 It's, regular's enough for me in that. And I didn't have, I couldn't schedule the honors. 

Recording: (333/ 9621) 
 We took, or I took a military ethics as a philosophy course and that was really interesting because even though, even in that hierarchy, there's still certain contexts. Within the context of war, for instance, if we both know, if we knowingly go into it as combatants and we're fighting for whatever cause, but if we both are willingly going into it, 

Recording: (334/ 9621) 
 now, every once in a while with my grandmother. She always wanted me to become a nurse and I was a senior in high school when she died and sometimes I think, boy, she would really like it if I was a nurse because I still use her blood pressure cuff and everything. She had given me her blood pressure cuff. I mean, it's very old. 

Recording: (335/ 9621) 
 Uh... 

Recording: (336/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (337/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my grandmother's from Ireland. My grandmother and grandfather are both from Ireland. 

Recording: (338/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (339/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but I mean, a kid that might want to save up for something when he's 12 years old has no chance at all of getting a job. 

Recording: (340/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (341/ 9621) 
 Well, that's the other thing. A lot of times they're good in the arts. They're either an artist. I have a boy right now that's an eighth grader that's painting a huge canvas for me for my living room because I haven't been able to find a picture. So I brought in the picture and he's enlarging it and painting it for me in his free time. And it's going to go in my living room. And I mean, he's really quite the artist. And music, arts, literature, acting, I've had kids that have been like really top-notch actors in the school plays. It's just not necessarily a school kind of thing that they're going to be good at. But I try to explain to the parents that just because your child learns differently is no reason to think they won't be successful in life. Mark Spitz won an Olympic gold medal. He has a learning disability. Cher Bono can't remember a phone number without transposing two of the numbers. She says that herself. Einstein didn't learn to read until he was 12. Winston Churchill, he stuttered until he was like 7 or 8. Walt Disney was told by a manager at Woolworth's that he would never have a creative idea in his life. 

Recording: (342/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (343/ 9621) 
 I think it depends on the child and I think it depends on the adult as far as the supervision of it. We're very strict as far as what games they have. It's so wild. When we were kids, cowboy and Indians, everybody had guns. If you had the best death act, you were the best. And nowadays, oh, don't let him have a gun, you know, don't let him play with, you know, even a squirt gun, you know, and so you wonder whether it's over exaggerated or, you know, none of us grew up shooting people or this, you know, we don't own any firearms, but we played with guns and played all these games. So I just wonder whether this is really, you know, but society's a lot different now. 

Recording: (344/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're going to most likely raise it up to 21 since all these, uh, the Kentucky and Maryland, Colorado, all those schools shootings. And I can't believe, man. I mean, there's articles in there. You wouldn't even believe if you haven't read them. 

Recording: (345/ 9621) 
 Most my friends. 

Recording: (346/ 9621) 
 And they should. And very rarely do doctors even ask about allergies. And more and more, and people don't even realize, and they get sick so often, they need to ask about allergies. Or even just have a little minor test that they can take when people, when they can't figure out what's wrong with them. Because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they've eaten. 

Recording: (347/ 9621) 
 So is there a large American population? Yeah, it's like cosmopolitan, but sometimes you just want to hang out with your own. So is there any problems just finding people from the States? 

Recording: (348/ 9621) 
 There were a lot of teammates that were cutting that much weight, if not more. They were pretty much doing it for the team. 

Recording: (349/ 9621) 
 Yeah, Franklin County usually votes differently than the rest of, at least the metropolitan areas of the state. 

Recording: (350/ 9621) 
 So I started work when I was 14. I've been working ever since. I've been out of school since I was 16. So I was in the service. I was in Vietnam. 

Recording: (351/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (352/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I do computer processing. Mostly what I, you know, I work from 10 at night until 8 in the morning, so. 

Recording: (353/ 9621) 
 just really starting to get started. And I mean, somebody, you have an MD, that's enough. You know, you want somebody who has computer skills as well. That's 

Recording: (354/ 9621) 
 Yeah. But I've never voted in the primary. My son said that I need to, but I'm not real interested in voting in the primary. 

Recording: (355/ 9621) 
 And then there's the one that's like, oh, I wish I had two weeks off at Christmas. Well, I used to work at Harding Hospital as a teacher. When I first went to Worthington, when I said I got another job, I got a job working at Harding Hospital as the principal, but I was also a teacher. So I taught part of the day, and I was also the administrator. Because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit, and they were away from home, and they had to go to school and get their credits somewhere. So the doctors always used to, we were on, like each person would be on a team of these kids, they'd be assigned to these kids and you'd go to your team meetings and the doctors, the shrinks would go, well, Mitch, I got two weeks off at Christmas. You know, they'd be bitching and moaning about the fact that we got time off and they didn't. And I finally came up with the perfect thing one time. I said, well, Dr. Simpson or whatever his name was, Dr. Brown, you know how it is. Some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off. 

Recording: (356/ 9621) 
 AIDS being one of them. 

Recording: (357/ 9621) 
 That's the optimism, yeah. OK, I have now Dover and Ferry. What else do I need to remember? 

Recording: (358/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (359/ 9621) 
 So that's mainly, probably more for fishing. 

Recording: (360/ 9621) 
 Do I think they will? Oh yes, I think they definitely will. I think there's so much heavy political and financial, well I'm going to reverse that statement. There's so much heavy financial influence upon the political influence that it's almost a foregone conclusion. And if it doesn't occur within this year, and there may be another vote in another year or next election, but I think that in fact it will go. 

Recording: (361/ 9621) 
 Sometimes she and Mary had more disagreements than I ever had with her. 

Recording: (362/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (363/ 9621) 
 Well, the humans have started it and the man narrating the thing said there wasn't a single animal that they profiled in the thing that behaved the way it did on its own accord. 

Recording: (364/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think it is. Of course, we were fiddling with that so much. 

Recording: (365/ 9621) 
 No, I don't want them to get together. I love the tension. If they get together, it's dead. Whenever they get a... I mean, there are like five or six examples where it looks like they're going to hook up. I mean, that one where there was like a... the duplicate molder. 

Recording: (366/ 9621) 
 Um, actually I think it needs to probably start younger than that. 

Recording: (367/ 9621) 
 Well, honestly growing up we didn't have, it wasn't really called sex ed. They talked about the female reproductive system. Nothing about men, which is kind of funny. It was always the women in that chart. 

Recording: (368/ 9621) 
 She said, you know what they say now? And I raised my hand and said, sixth. She said, fourth. 

Recording: (369/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (370/ 9621) 
 It makes me angry that people like that even get money. 

Recording: (371/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (372/ 9621) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (373/ 9621) 
 So I was shut out of the job market then. That didn't bother me. I thought, well, fine. That's when I got the job at Channel 4. But it's like anything else. Some blacks use it for good. Some blacks use it for bad. 

Recording: (374/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (375/ 9621) 
 this means I get to hear more of my book. 

Recording: (376/ 9621) 
 And I go, the same cake at Meijer would have been like $7 or something like that. But I don't try to be the cheapskate. I mean, I won't go without health plan or anything like that. But there are certain, like my car, I love cars. And you take the car to car wash, it's like $7.50 or $8. And you wash in the driveway, and it's about a quarter. It's like, it takes time. If you have no time, and I have friends at work that their mom is a taxi cab driver and the dad is the worker bee. And when they get home, they don't want to do anything. So they pay to have the yard done. They do this, da, da, da, da. And it's like they have, then they always go, we have no money. And it's like, because you pay to do everything, you know, slow your life down a little bit, you know, it's like you making your soup, you know, when, if, and when you have children, when they get my age, they're going to go, I can remember walking around the house and going, mama's making bean soup, or mama's making vegetable soup, or mom baked a cake. It's like, as opposed to, open it up, oh, here's a Meyer cake. 

Recording: (377/ 9621) 
 That's alright. 

Recording: (378/ 9621) 
 And they're less hyper about like, you know, bad things for people to do, you know, the drinking, the smoking. They're just not as strict about it basically. 

Recording: (379/ 9621) 
 And like I say, I don't believe that homosexuality is taught. I think the kid will grow up and discover girls and be just fine. 

Recording: (380/ 9621) 
 Well, we put all kinds of information out on our own website, which there's so much, it's very hard to find what you want. That's a constant problem with information, is the more you put out there, the harder it is to find what you want. But if you can't get to it, if it's not out there, you can't find it. It's a problem for us and for libraries, because there's just a barrage of what they're getting. And it's not just from us, it's from the literature. There's literally hundreds of library publications. And it's a problem that librarians are facing all the time. They can't keep up. 

Recording: (381/ 9621) 
 and I was raised here most of my life. 

Recording: (382/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (383/ 9621) 
 I'm drifting. 

Recording: (384/ 9621) 
 Hehehehe 

Recording: (385/ 9621) 
 So they got us kids vaccinated in time, but dad didn't. 

Recording: (386/ 9621) 
 No ands, ifs, or buts, you go to jail for three years. 

Recording: (387/ 9621) 
 Eh. 

Recording: (388/ 9621) 
 the other one just fit in really well. 

Recording: (389/ 9621) 
 A little bit, yeah. 

Recording: (390/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (391/ 9621) 
 That's perfect. 

Recording: (392/ 9621) 
 they what they 

Recording: (393/ 9621) 
 I haven't been paying a lot of attention to it just because... 

Recording: (394/ 9621) 
 so embarrassed. I'm so sorry. And the guy's like, eh, nobody else is eating it. She might as well. 

Recording: (395/ 9621) 
 which was, see with those guns of ours, we figured within 10 yards was a hit. And because if you had one of those things, 37 pounds of TNT go off within 10 yards of it. 

Recording: (396/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (397/ 9621) 
 Right now he's really interested in Eastern religions. I'm not sure where that came from. You know, when they go to college and they're gone and you don't see him much. That's what he's interested in right now. So I don't think it really took. 

Recording: (398/ 9621) 
 Well, he told a Jewish friend of mine that her grandparents that died in the Holocaust went to hell because they were Jewish. 

Recording: (399/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (400/ 9621) 
 Because I've seen more violence on alcohol, I've seen more women beat, I've seen more kids beat, I've seen more drunk in driving racks. 

Recording: (401/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (402/ 9621) 
 and their needs were immediate. 

Recording: (403/ 9621) 
 So I just see a pattern, you know, I just feel like this is going to happen to me eventually. 

Recording: (404/ 9621) 
 I was going to say, I've seen situations too where I can see their side of it as well because the mothers are used to, or the wives are used to being home and the husbands support them. And in those situations, they still want them to. They still don't want to go out there and do that. And, um, and you know, they need to look at each one of those cases too. Cause I know there's alimony and all that kind of thing. And that can be detrimental to the man cause he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know, 

Recording: (405/ 9621) 
 Oh really? Where are you from? 

Recording: (406/ 9621) 
 I think the fact that things like responsibility, maybe a long time ago people stayed married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of their family. I mean, and you can be divorced and still take care of your family instead of, you know, things as far as people getting pregnant and then this person goes off and leaves and you've got a lot of unmarried single women that are all by themselves. It's more socially acceptable to be able to do these things now than I think it was a long time ago. People's families would never stand for something like that. They'd say, look, you need to take care of this, you need to deal with this. Now it's just kind of normal and everybody just kind of goes along with it. 

Recording: (407/ 9621) 
 all the kids in the world. All that will happen through that. That influenced all the kids. 

Recording: (408/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (409/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (410/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (411/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's either gonna be find the house we want or we'll go build it somewhere 

Recording: (412/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think they do. 

Recording: (413/ 9621) 
 Not that I've seen, you know. 

Recording: (414/ 9621) 
 Well, the charge was cutting class. Yeah, and what it was, I was supposed to meet my mom outside. I told my teacher I brought a note and got an excuse, slip and all that. I went down to my locker before, and the teacher, we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you. Not a teacher, but an administrator, excuse me. And she was out there and she saw me in my locker and what are you doing down here in the whole 30 minute conversation that could have only lasted five minutes with thank you, okay, here's my slip. She thought I forged the slip. 

Recording: (415/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (416/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (417/ 9621) 
 I'm an independent. 

Recording: (418/ 9621) 
 and trying to stop it. I'm trying to think of some good examples. I mean, when politicians start talking about biological functions, 

Recording: (419/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's a tour. It's a package tour. You have Rome, Florence, Venice, Pisa. It doesn't interest me. 

Recording: (420/ 9621) 
 Exactly, yeah. 

Recording: (421/ 9621) 
 It was a law enforcement career center and I mean 

Recording: (422/ 9621) 
 Well, it's sort of like the sociology of like clicks, you know, like how how that develops like how people like some people seek to like fit in like Like that's a real strong like 

Recording: (423/ 9621) 
 Yeah! Yeah! 

Recording: (424/ 9621) 
 and how are you? And I know like one point in time it's like we don't want to hang out with you Crystal. I'm like well fine I don't care I'll go hang out with them. It's like they they still need to do a lot of growing up. 

Recording: (425/ 9621) 
 Yeah, the near west side has always been a pretty bad area. Well, in the last 40 or 50 years and it's starting to creep west. 

Recording: (426/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (427/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's true. Well, we went OSU's, they've got a nice facility. I mean, they have a labor and delivery room. It's weird though, because when you go, they show you, they talk about all this Whirlpool bath thing. I don't know if you've heard those commercials or not, but there's only one room that's like that. 

Recording: (428/ 9621) 
 And that's really an important issue right now. I saw that the first time in 1992, because I haven't said it yet, but anyone listening to this tape, you would be able to know I'm a Democrat and generally vote Democratic. Although I'll tell you, I did vote for Greg Lashucka once, and if he had run again, I would have voted for him, because I like his style. And he hasn't been bad for the city, but I'm generally a Democrat, and I've only voted for two people who won the presidential election. And I knew in 92, early on, that Clinton was going to win just by being out with people. And I was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend and a waiter came up and he said something about, you know, and I can't remember how we got started on the topic, you know, just taking my order for a restaurant, but he said something about, Dole was too old. And this was a young guy, he was in college. And I knew there was a sort of a shift. People wanted someone with younger ideas and a new vision. They didn't want the World War II vision anymore. And I thought that was kind of interesting because by and large, young people also supported Reagan and I thought do they really understand the difference in issues and what the two stand for but it was that Reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did Clinton so I think for the average voter that does have a lot of sway. 

Recording: (429/ 9621) 
 Oh, the festivals in the summer that they have downtown. I mean, those are really great. And they're crowded, but they're peaceful. There's not rioting in the streets. And there's a lot to do and great music. 

Recording: (430/ 9621) 
 Really, and it's a fun job, it really is. I've only ever known one male that taught first grade. And I knew one guy that taught third. Most of the time if they go into elementary ed, they go for the upper grades, like four, five, or six. But I really think that if we let the boys be more exposed to men earlier, then they would be more motivated to learn because they would see that it's not just a girly thing. They would say, oh, well, Mr. So-and-so thinks it's important that I know this, and he's a real macho guy, so I better learn it, you know? I do. I really do. Nowadays, with the pay being better, we are getting more men. 

Recording: (431/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (432/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (433/ 9621) 
 Well, according to government, she would have. 

Recording: (434/ 9621) 
 Right, right, you know. 

Recording: (435/ 9621) 
 We haven't talked about adopting the baby, but at our age. 

Recording: (436/ 9621) 
 Jerry who wasn't Jerry Springer or Jerry somebody that's on there and he has 

Recording: (437/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (438/ 9621) 
 Oh, let's see. I've already told you more than I ever told anybody else, I think. 

Recording: (439/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (440/ 9621) 
 But I 

Recording: (441/ 9621) 
 They just, she was drinking, I mean terrible alcoholic and very, his father was very abusive and they weren't even married. 

Recording: (442/ 9621) 
 Right, yeah. Well, my oldest daughter is the biggest cheapskate. I keep asking her when I call her on the phone or I email her every day. I said, are you out of money? She goes, well, I have like $3, but I'm not going to the bank machine because you're picking me up Tuesday. And I'm not paying a $2 service charge to get money out. I'll wait till I get home. And I'm like, I can't complain. 

Recording: (443/ 9621) 
 There's a feeble attempt to make you well-rounded, is what there is, but there's no specific language class. 

Recording: (444/ 9621) 
 I am. 

Recording: (445/ 9621) 
 You understand what I mean? 

Recording: (446/ 9621) 
 No, no, she has to do it. It's chaos up there. It is chaos. I mean, they had somebody come in to oversee the whole setup to see where they needed more help at, whether they needed more nurses. And the guy told her the person that was in charge, the head nurse or whatever, there's no way that person can do that job. They still do it. So when you're in charge, it's just a nightmare. You're supposed to know where every single patient is, where they're charged, what's going on, what room they're in. You're just walking around like a crazy person all day. 

Recording: (447/ 9621) 
 Yes, I do. 

Recording: (448/ 9621) 
 Like sitting out on the street all the time, honking the horns, ringing the bells, doing the whistles, the really annoying chants. I had classes in the BNZ building that we just had to cancel because they were too loud. 

Recording: (449/ 9621) 
 doing the dumbing down of schools. 

Recording: (450/ 9621) 
 I'm surprised myself, you know They wouldn't say who the guy was that interviewed but I don't think that probably that hard to figure out you know, they're 

Recording: (451/ 9621) 
 Didn't get vaccinated in time. And he was just covered with those sores for I don't know how long. Mom said that after they started, after the scabs started falling off of him, he'd get out of the bed and she'd take the sheet out in the yard and shake it to get those scabs off. 

Recording: (452/ 9621) 
 To be close, so I didn't have to drive. 

Recording: (453/ 9621) 
 Now you will hear me way too much. 

Recording: (454/ 9621) 
 Well, that's what they've done. Well, they've done that here, too. They've done it at every university. 

Recording: (455/ 9621) 
 And that's a problem in our society. And if something can come out of the university here to promote the reverse of that, I think you have a lot less psychological problems with people. And domestic problems, work problems, everything. Because the problem comes down to the fact, well, gee, it's not recognized. Whatever these trends in our society, well, you gotta be a computer guru. Before Gates was recognized, he was nothing. 

Recording: (456/ 9621) 
 with my mother. 

Recording: (457/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, yeah, you work really hard while you're at it. And then when you're done, you're done. 

Recording: (458/ 9621) 
 I would think it would be cheaper. Organic food. 

Recording: (459/ 9621) 
 No, my husband, yeah, he's from she can wear a bandana, but that's it. And you know, I would love to do that with her only on things like that. I wouldn't be the type that would put a sweater on her on Tuesday and a little skirt on her on Wednesday. But I would get a kick out of that. 

Recording: (460/ 9621) 
 And I didn't do that myself, but we had a couple of boys in the outfit who could find where we were on a map and where our OP, our observation post was, and where the enemy out here was and all that. And it was interesting calculating, trying to calculate where your shells were going to land out there. 

Recording: (461/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (462/ 9621) 
 Really. 

Recording: (463/ 9621) 
 different. 

Recording: (464/ 9621) 
 the bonding. 

Recording: (465/ 9621) 
 Of course, I'm gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere I go. 

Recording: (466/ 9621) 
 Leaving out stuff, man. 

Recording: (467/ 9621) 
 pizza. 

Recording: (468/ 9621) 
 I mean, I don't think they should get rid of it for Polaris thing. But, you know, there's plenty of malls to go to if that's the case. It's not a big deal to me to tell you the truth. No, actually I live closer. I live east more. 

Recording: (469/ 9621) 
 Is that right? I just love those koala bears. Just to see a koala bear, I'd go. They're just like little teddy bears. Bring one home to your daughter. Say, here's a little playmate. Here's a baby brother for you. Really? Do they? Oh, they look so sweet and cuddly. You know, just like something you just want to take home. Really? What do they eat? 

Recording: (470/ 9621) 
 Well, my son started in public school for kindergarten. And he just, my son is, my son is a very social child, we'll say. He's the one that talks too much. As the teachers say, he's a social child. He talks too much, he likes to get up and run around, and he needs something very structured. He needs the time to run around, but he needs something very structured. You get him near a bunch of other kids when he was little, and it was like he would just run and scream at them because he was ready to play. Well, yeah, and my daughter is the opposite of that. But he would do that. And so he wasn't learning things, and he was constantly getting in trouble. And it's like, I don't know. We would be told he was very frightened. He wasn't learning things and he was constantly getting in trouble. We would be told he was a problem, but he didn't understand what was going on. If there wasn't a structure, he would go to school every day and not know what to expect. Because it wasn't like, we'll do this and then we'll do this and we'll do this. So we checked out the Catholic school and they were organized that way. And it just was a better match for him. And then when my daughter went to school, it was just easier to take him to the same school. And that goes back to, reminding me of another thing I wanted to say about why the discipline and behavior may be different in the Catholic school is, you're paying bucks. It's $4,500 a year for us to send her to school. And if we find out she's not doing her work, it's a very different perspective. 

Recording: (471/ 9621) 
 is really opposing my belief, so I stand there and pretty much spar with them about it and he usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave. 

Recording: (472/ 9621) 
 Is it? Oh, that's a good day. 

Recording: (473/ 9621) 
 yes for attention and yeah. 

Recording: (474/ 9621) 
 I think the divorce rate has gone up because it's more socially acceptable. I'm sure there's plenty of people 20 years ago that would have loved to have gotten a divorce had that been an option. I think a lot of it just depends on the way you handle it. How you handle it after the divorce is final. Does that make any sense at all? 

Recording: (475/ 9621) 
 I don't see how we can say, I mean, we can refuse to see certain classes of movies or watch certain classes of shows, but without getting into that First Amendment thing, I don't know. I've never seen it happen in my lifetime. So I don't know if it could be, but then of course it can't go on the same way forever. I can't keep progressing, I don't think. 

Recording: (476/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (477/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (478/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (479/ 9621) 
 essentially dying. And so we were dealing with all of this at the same time. I mean, there was one night I remember we were ready to leave the hospital about 730. We checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we'd heard from him. And got a message that my mother-in-law had fallen and she was in an emergency room, the same hospital, fortunately. So we went down there. Then on the way home, got a phone call on the cell phone from the hospital that my father-in-law had had some bleeding, so we had to go back to the hospital. And then we went around, driving around, looking for my son. And this was not unusual. It was a horrible period. And I think what made my wife and I the angriest was that he's the only one that really could control his behavior. The others couldn't. 

Recording: (480/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (481/ 9621) 
 That's not a shocking surprise. I mean, I rarely get a kid for math, although we do have kids that are learning disabled and they don't understand math either, even though it's very concrete. 

Recording: (482/ 9621) 
 Government doesn't seem to work too swiftly. 

Recording: (483/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is a really disciplined school, but it's a lot of rebellion at the same time. 

Recording: (484/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (485/ 9621) 
 Sometimes I think that it's just like math sucks and it's like 

Recording: (486/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (487/ 9621) 
 Exactly. Huge. 

Recording: (488/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (489/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (490/ 9621) 
 It's just major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming. 

Recording: (491/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (492/ 9621) 
 Well, I should tell them that they should love themselves. The girls should, both of them, should love their bodies and not give it to a boy that's falling all over you and you feel all good and this and that. You should respect yourself and love your body and don't give yourself to somebody just because you're feeling good. And the boys, I should, the boys need to calm down. I mean, I don't know 

Recording: (493/ 9621) 
 She has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that. 

Recording: (494/ 9621) 
 XCS, there are a few people that I know that use it. 

Recording: (495/ 9621) 
 on the issues, but I think it does mean a lot to other people. So I can't really answer that question how they would have voted. Because I didn't think that Mike Coleman exactly had charisma either. 

Recording: (496/ 9621) 
 Oh my... 

Recording: (497/ 9621) 
 We're buying it, yeah. And we should have paid off about five years. Then we're talking about moving someplace a little simpler to take care of. 

Recording: (498/ 9621) 
 uh... i think uh... i think uh... high school and i like that people are so very soon the standards you know for a for high school things but uh... i think uh... it's kind of like it's really hard to like i thought about for just what's wrong with the education system in general and i think it's more of a... College is a little bit different, I guess, but it's more of like this whole, like, the teacher's talking, and the information goes from the teacher's mouth to the student's notes without going through either of their brains. It's just blah about, you know, just like it's, it's, it's real structured, but it's real hard to think about what to do to change that. It's kind of like more like, I don't know, I mean, I had really good, like there was a couple of really good teachers, like my history teachers and English teachers were really good. 

Recording: (499/ 9621) 
 Was she, where is she from, Latin America? 

Recording: (500/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (501/ 9621) 
 You see? 

Recording: (502/ 9621) 
 And the problem is as a youngster as you grow up, you don't realize how much your parents did for you until you're probably about 35, 40, you don't realize, my goodness, mom, dad, you made a sacrifice because now I'm learning a little more what you did. And then by the time you're maybe 60, 50, 60, now you got to take care of your parents if you had the morals to do it, otherwise you just ship them off to the farm. 

Recording: (503/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (504/ 9621) 
 the three Rs, you know, I think those are still very important. 

Recording: (505/ 9621) 
 They were actually able to select a couple. They talked to a lawyer who arranges the options and she had a file and they, through a bunch of questions and answers type thing, were able to limit them to three couples and they liked the first couple they met. 

Recording: (506/ 9621) 
 along with what my father thinks and says and if he wants it a certain way, why you just don't question that. And I just don't do that. It's wrong. 

Recording: (507/ 9621) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (508/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because I don't have a degree. 

Recording: (509/ 9621) 
 And a lot of it was the bitterness of the divorce. 

Recording: (510/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (511/ 9621) 
 et à y croire. 

Recording: (512/ 9621) 
 They don't do it today unless the person's a scholar. I mean, a 3.8 Rhodes Scholar, hey, okay. 

Recording: (513/ 9621) 
 So it's been very difficult for us, particularly the last four years. And about the time he ran away was between the time my father-in-law died and my mother-in-law died, which was in a five-month period. So my wife's had a lot to deal with. And she's had a lot to deal with in that time. 

Recording: (514/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (515/ 9621) 
 Just 

Recording: (516/ 9621) 
 Right. The hardest, both the hardest and easiest thing I think I've ever done was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized. 

Recording: (517/ 9621) 
 you. 

Recording: (518/ 9621) 
 No, I wouldn't have. 

Recording: (519/ 9621) 
 getting them someplace stable. 

Recording: (520/ 9621) 
 I think it's the right position to take. But like abortion, that's one of the big issues that divide people very quickly. I think it's moderating somewhat as the gay activists continue their campaigns. But that's one where a candidate has to tread very carefully. I was proud that Coleman said it and didn't back down on that. They told me a little bit about his character. I don't know that I can answer your question straightforward because I believe in gay rights. I believe in anybody's rights. What happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business, not mine. 

Recording: (521/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was five weeks early delivering. So it was really unplanned as far as when we were expecting it. 

Recording: (522/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (523/ 9621) 
 I don't know that much about it, to be quite honest. I did read about it in the paper, and I know the whole thing with Chief Jackson and the whole mayoral candidates, how they're getting debates over that. And I know this is something new on top of that. I know it was the front page on Sunday's paper. I looked at it briefly. I think there must be some truth to it. I don't know the extent. 

Recording: (524/ 9621) 
 Well, I would say in Springfield, yeah. 

Recording: (525/ 9621) 
 Right, right. I think there's so many small communities, like even though OSU has really, obviously its own little community and then you've got, you know, Dublin and they've got their own parades and their own different things. So I agree. I mean, I think that there really is a lot of things to do in that own individual area that I can't see somebody from Dublin going over to the west side to do anything. You know what I don't, and maybe also I feel safer where I live too and that's something that's an issue for me. I know when I do travel down Cleveland Avenue, it does, it makes me nervous. So I just kind of stay away from that. 

Recording: (526/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (527/ 9621) 
 I was 48 when I retired. It's great. It's terrific. 

Recording: (528/ 9621) 
 Now, well, it's like you buy it and then you get to do the shopping. The fun part, you go out and pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that, and then you have somebody else do that part. But I don't do like major gutting or anything. I just like to get something that needs, that I can have a vision. I can usually see this can be really fabulous if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So that's the kind of stuff. And I've only done three or four of them, but it's fun. 

Recording: (529/ 9621) 
 Well, I think the price has a lot to do with it because I mean that's what I see over there that prevents it. You know, they're a sort of middle of the line dress that would be like at the limited here or something is, you know, 75 pounds, you know, like a dollar 65 or whatever conversion. I mean, that's a lot. You know, you see them in limited and you think whatever the price is think whatever the price is expensive, but really if you buy that, you're not really gonna be buying more than one or anything else for a while. I think, I mean, here there is that sort of like, he has the most wins or whatever that phrase is. And there is that with CDs and stuff. is cheap, people buy so much of it. Like portions are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply. I mean, there, you know, the portions are a lot smaller. It's more expensive. You just eat less. And I mean, you just see it contributing to everything. I mean, the obesity problem here and everything else. I mean, it's getting worse there than it was. But I mean, it's nowhere is it anywhere near. And that is a large part of the problem with that people were constantly on me about, oh, why are Americans so fat? And all these things on the television about the Americans. And I mean, that was never ending. 

Recording: (530/ 9621) 
 MWAH! 

Recording: (531/ 9621) 
 I get a job at Hyde Park. It's amazing, because the money is so good. You can't beat it. I only have to work three or four nights a week, and it leaves my whole day free for classes. Hyde Park Grill is a restaurant in Dublin. I did that all through high school and college. After I graduated from high school, I managed a restaurant for about a year and a half. 

Recording: (532/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (533/ 9621) 
 I look like a college student that would go here, so I've never had a problem. So we go and do that. And we're planning a road trip. We haven't decided. We're thinking Atlantic City or Florida or New York City or New Orleans. Those are the choices, and we're trying to narrow it down. 

Recording: (534/ 9621) 
 It has to be a longstanding kind of thing. Yeah, you know, and that worries me more than I understand a lot of the objection is because this is just, this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know, you know, one legal step leads to another legal step and then we'll have gay marriage and all those things. But I don't think that would be a bad thing either. 

Recording: (535/ 9621) 
 I don't remember that at all. I know how to do it, but I'm not sure who taught me how to do it. 

Recording: (536/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. Right. 

Recording: (537/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (538/ 9621) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (539/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (540/ 9621) 
 Not necessarily the Catholic beliefs. 

Recording: (541/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (542/ 9621) 
 I'm a camper. 

Recording: (543/ 9621) 
 The Reds more so than Indians back my younger days because they weren't worth a damn but 

Recording: (544/ 9621) 
 My honors class is challenging and organic chemistry is very challenging, but 

Recording: (545/ 9621) 
 He will be, yeah, it's a week from Sunday. 

Recording: (546/ 9621) 
 I had one while I was there. I have two kids. 29 and 22. They're real good. 

Recording: (547/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (548/ 9621) 
 And she said, well, Mary just as well go out and get a job. She doesn't need to sit around here. 

Recording: (549/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (550/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, we did that, too. 

Recording: (551/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (552/ 9621) 
 Well, usually normal kids. 

Recording: (553/ 9621) 
 She said I'd talk to the devil. 

Recording: (554/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (555/ 9621) 
 Is there anything else you need to know or 

Recording: (556/ 9621) 
 You'd sleep in three pairs of sweats, so you'd lose about two and a half pounds in your sleep. 

Recording: (557/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (558/ 9621) 
 Well, if you want something local, that's all you can got. I mean, there's one paper. 

Recording: (559/ 9621) 
 No, I don't. I just got too expensive. 

Recording: (560/ 9621) 
 Um, no. I have a beautiful niece. I love her to death. I knew at a young age and actually wanted to make it a permanent decision. But doctors at that time wouldn't do it. I was like 25 and I knew they wouldn't even consider it. They said you'll change your mind. And I knew I just never felt a mother instinct. And it's funny. Yesterday actually last night we went to visit a friend of ours had a baby yesterday two days ago and when we left the room and she has a two-year-old child and now another little girl I said Derek you know it's it's nice to go in there and see that but I just have no 

Recording: (561/ 9621) 
 Or is it a student visa or a tourist visa? 

Recording: (562/ 9621) 
 Bye! 

Recording: (563/ 9621) 
 It's a real boring, boring town. 

Recording: (564/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (565/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (566/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (567/ 9621) 
 And then it takes a while to get to know the person, and then I become friends with them. It's like, for some reason, I didn't want to do that. 

Recording: (568/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, you can't get them off. 

Recording: (569/ 9621) 
 Because I have a real good sense of how things have to be. See, my husband and I are very different. We're very different, but we're really lucky. We have a fabulous relationship. And he's real grateful and appreciative. And you said as long as he appreciates you now, he will come home and say, 

Recording: (570/ 9621) 
 You can be an independent. 

Recording: (571/ 9621) 
 That's your dad. That ain't the best place to be going when you get off school, you know? 

Recording: (572/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (573/ 9621) 
 Really? I know, so it's like the same deal with Canada, you know, like how it used to be owned by, okay. 

Recording: (574/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I don't particularly like anyone. 

Recording: (575/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (576/ 9621) 
 We won, we were victorious. We didn't won, you know. 

Recording: (577/ 9621) 
 No, it was kind of disturbing actually. 

Recording: (578/ 9621) 
 then obviously the civilization is going to be dead. 

Recording: (579/ 9621) 
 He's white, just a real down, just look like he's from the ghetto. Just nasty guy. 

Recording: (580/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (581/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right, if you're lucky. But I mean, there's the person that says that, and then there's the other person that says, well, I sure admire what you do, and I wouldn't be a teacher for anything in this world. You know, the one that's just in awe of you. 

Recording: (582/ 9621) 
 So I should really realize this parking situation, but like I said, I usually walk, and today I don't really feel like it. I'm having a baby in about two weeks here, really ready to get this over with. 

Recording: (583/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (584/ 9621) 
 Right. Well, when I was taking teacher education classes here and observing classroom teachers, they would always tell me, you need to give a grade for class participation. 

Recording: (585/ 9621) 
 Northern Mall hosts the Battle of the Bands once a month. 

Recording: (586/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (587/ 9621) 
 You can't, no. 

Recording: (588/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (589/ 9621) 
 Yeah. And the bendy board. 

Recording: (590/ 9621) 
 Well, as I told my daughter when she came on, I said, you know, religion is a business. She said, oh no, dad, it's not religion. I said, it sure is a business. I said, it's just the superficial things. The packages are attractive to you. 

Recording: (591/ 9621) 
 They used to grow wild when I was a kid. 

Recording: (592/ 9621) 
 So that's where he's always parked. 

Recording: (593/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (594/ 9621) 
 And I saw one of my friends had to work so hard to get into MIT. 

Recording: (595/ 9621) 
 Oh, it's some committee. I mean, you have to send them in to someplace at the state of Ohio. 

Recording: (596/ 9621) 
 So it's pretty much regular, like just a Western wedding where they throw the rice. 

Recording: (597/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah. 

Recording: (598/ 9621) 
 Right. And also, the other thing is you have to be sort of compassionate because you're working a lot of airplanes and you're wanting answers like this. When you spit something out, you want an answer. Each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign. Like if I tell somebody, turn left heading 360, and he's supposed to respond TWA 396, roger. Well, if he doesn't respond, then I've got to say it again, which means instead of 10 airplanes, I now have 11 I'm talking to, because I have to talk to him two times each. There are some people that get really mad quick, because they want that answer like that. I was a pilot, so sometimes I'm thinking, 

Recording: (599/ 9621) 
 which was 57 cents an hour. 

Recording: (600/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (601/ 9621) 
 Sure. 

Recording: (602/ 9621) 
 I've been in Columbus since 1977 and I'm an air traffic controller and I have three more days to work before I retire. I'm retiring Sunday. Tomorrow is my retirement dinner. I'm a little nervous about what I have to do there. They've told me nothing except show up. 

Recording: (603/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I had about three or four friends that were actually gay. 

Recording: (604/ 9621) 
 And so you had. 

Recording: (605/ 9621) 
 I can't say that really bothered me. Like I said, it's something that's his choice, his opinion and whatnot. I mean, it's up to him. It doesn't affect the nation any or anything like that. I mean, he's still, as long as he's making the right decisions or whatever, then... 

Recording: (606/ 9621) 
 But basically I went back in operations because it's not the money, I like the job. 

Recording: (607/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we do office parties and everything. Like yesterday, we had to go to an attorney's firm and just fruit and cookies. People tend to have food more and more, you can't believe, gourmet lunches and things, a lot more than they did, let's say, 10 years ago. 

Recording: (608/ 9621) 
 Oh, and the city. 

Recording: (609/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (610/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (611/ 9621) 
 Sunday School. 

Recording: (612/ 9621) 
 We were married 11 years. 

Recording: (613/ 9621) 
 I do. I'll tell you, I've seen every name. After 28 years of 

Recording: (614/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (615/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (616/ 9621) 
 What did you do? Did you do the tourist thing? 

Recording: (617/ 9621) 
 So I guess, what can I do? 

Recording: (618/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (619/ 9621) 
 And if I continue to do that for a long period of time, I become very unpopular. 

Recording: (620/ 9621) 
 My parents homesteaded out there in 1911 or 12, shortly after they were married. 

Recording: (621/ 9621) 
 I walked out and it wasn't quietly and I walked out. But it felt good and I didn't even know if I was gonna be living in the streets, but I'll never forget the day, you know, and his wife worked in the office too. So I went to her and I said, it was nice working with you, I'm going home, you know, you can reach me at home. And then he was shocked and he just couldn't believe it and he said, you can't do this. He says, I won't pay you. And I said, you me walk out the door and I don't want any money. So I left out. Oh, it was just a long drawn out thing. I mean, it started out with little things and then it just got bigger. Like he had an office off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent insurance company and he had his own agency and he was a successful, I mean he probably still is out there very successful, but I was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the building and he locked the door and turned around. He said, why don't you get the front door? And it was only he and I in the office and every once in a while his wife would be in there. And I just, I lost it. I was mad, but I didn't want him to think that I was afraid. I wanted him to be afraid of me. So I just, I stomped back to my desk, and I said, oh great. I said, not only are you a pain to work with, I have to be afraid of you. And then I think I did scare him, because he backed off a lot. and his, and then that, that was a real slap in the face for him. So he was really mean after that. So I left. I just, I walked out. I picked the kids up at the bus stop and they're like, mommy, what are you doing? I said, we're going somewhere. Let's get in the car. So, but yeah, just a couple of experiences like that though'll make you do other things so you know I stayed tough and I you know got other jobs and 

Recording: (622/ 9621) 
 I mean, we had goals, certain things that, like we had a set where we'd like to do four hours of service every week. 

Recording: (623/ 9621) 
 through the women's group and. 

Recording: (624/ 9621) 
 And we had like tapes we listened to with native speakers. So you got really good really quick 

Recording: (625/ 9621) 
 right. My husband drops them off and I pick them up so he's there for the shortest amount of time. 

Recording: (626/ 9621) 
 And I guess it worked for them. 

Recording: (627/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (628/ 9621) 
 I don't even know what to say, what a disgrace. It's just embarrassing, it really is. 

Recording: (629/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (630/ 9621) 
 Are they friendlier than the koalas? 

Recording: (631/ 9621) 
 My mom never had an upper girl. Jay's mom never had an upper girl. You know, and that looks worse to me. Did you see that? It takes 20 minutes. They thread this thing, this needle in your back. They put this, that sounds worse to me than even having a baby. I just can't, I don't really think of my back. So I guess it's true. You just have to wait and see when she get there, what happens. 

Recording: (632/ 9621) 
 What do I want out of life? 

Recording: (633/ 9621) 
 Especially when we try to sleep at five in the morning. 

Recording: (634/ 9621) 
 That was your youth. And that's good. 

Recording: (635/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (636/ 9621) 
 getting electrocuted or something yeah that just doesn't appeal to me too much but I mean it's really not too difficult I mean as long as you're careful and 

Recording: (637/ 9621) 
 That's right. Straight 4.0 kids. But it's true. My mom really has worked with them to make sure that they get into some programs that they need. And there are some things now, I think, that they're developing that they didn't have before. 

Recording: (638/ 9621) 
 They use drugs, but not to the extreme that college students do. 

Recording: (639/ 9621) 
 Do you? You do that, do you? 

Recording: (640/ 9621) 
 Great. 

Recording: (641/ 9621) 
 Well, I play actually in two orchestras, in the Symphony and in the Orchestra, which is an all amateur group. But it's actually, there were times when I was, I've been in that group for maybe seven or eight years now, and there have been times when I've been in that group that I've thought it had a really wretched sound. Because they don't have auditions. They just take anybody that wants to play. And if you take a string player that can't play in tune, it can really wreck everything. Yeah. But I think we've improved a lot. We gave a concert a couple weeks ago at a church in Upper Arlington and I thought it went pretty well. Win Peace, a little bit of Mozart, some concertos. So that was fun. Yeah. 

Recording: (642/ 9621) 
 That would just send me into the new millennium or whatever you want to call it. 

Recording: (643/ 9621) 
 I have worked in PM Gallery in the short north. 

Recording: (644/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (645/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (646/ 9621) 
 I have no idea. 

Recording: (647/ 9621) 
 Um, yeah. I mean, I've got girls that are, that have girlfriends and stuff. And it doesn't bother me. I mean, I'm not, I like men and I'm, I'm a Christian and I just believe that, you know, you should be, you shouldn't, God didn't put two women on this earth. God didn't put two men. They put a man and a woman to be together, to have kids. 

Recording: (648/ 9621) 
 And so they went up there, but the Germans caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot. And that area of Enzio was just flat as this table almost for an area back from the Mediterranean, back probably 10 miles, and it was 10 or 12 miles long, the coast long. And so we had enough area to manipulate in, and it was crisscrossed with deep ditches of some kind. I don't know whether they were irrigation ditches or what, which we used as fortifications. 

Recording: (649/ 9621) 
 And I was in like missiles and stuff so 

Recording: (650/ 9621) 
 I haven't bought anything off the internet yet. I don't know, something about giving my credit card number away is kind of... 

Recording: (651/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (652/ 9621) 
 That's mean. That's why nobody brings it. 

Recording: (653/ 9621) 
 Yeah, probably. 

Recording: (654/ 9621) 
 No. No. 

Recording: (655/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (656/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (657/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's gotta be hard if you haven't had other projects. 

Recording: (658/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's a, you can, if you're, if you can't go to a girl's dorm until I think maybe the afternoon, I think maybe 11, I'm not sure. But you have to be out by a certain time. It's not as bad as like Malone, like I don't know if you've heard about Malone, they have like certain days. So it's not like that, but it's still just a pain. 

Recording: (659/ 9621) 
 It's only a couple people. It's not. The majority of people I work around are black. But like I said, the majority of people I work around, I get along with great. 

Recording: (660/ 9621) 
 T 

Recording: (661/ 9621) 
 So uh... 

Recording: (662/ 9621) 
 Gambling. 

Recording: (663/ 9621) 
 I was taking like 21 to 23 hours a quarter. 

Recording: (664/ 9621) 
 You can do part-time, you can do three or two day a week. 

Recording: (665/ 9621) 
 영상편집 및 자막을 사용하였습니다. 

Recording: (666/ 9621) 
 I'm going out there like this in a freaking retards I swear. But there's kids out there always cutting. 

Recording: (667/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm because I want his morals and you know his basic stuff to come from me really 

Recording: (668/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (669/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (670/ 9621) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (671/ 9621) 
 Fry. 

Recording: (672/ 9621) 
 Answered an ad in the paper, but I've sung in, well, Sean sings in the symphony chorus too. I've sung in it for 16 years. 

Recording: (673/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (674/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (675/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I just renewed my certificate last year, so I may get back into it. Part of the reason I renewed my certificate was I did some home instruction with the Columbus Public Schools last year, and that's kind of like a tutoring job where you can go, you can arrange hours with a student that is at home for some reason. I had one that just had a baby. And it's an interesting job because they look for somebody that can cover the most technical, I guess, subject that the student is taking. In my case, it turned out to be chemistry and one, I think chemistry once and it was algebra two another time. But they expected us to, at least they expected me to cover the other subjects too, or at least to spend a little bit of time on them. So there was English and there was history. So it really requires you to be well-rounded. And I like, kind of like that. I've taught in a couple of other places, community colleges. The College in Newark, I taught a chemistry class there. And the community college, which is in Hillsboro, but I taught at their branch. And I taught an introduction to ecology class there. And an introduction to the arts, it was called. And that was interesting. It's kind of an underclass of teachers. They don't pay you enough to do that. They pay you per student contact hour. And in my chemistry class I was teaching I think a total of five or six contact hours a week and they were paying something like $21 or $22 an hour. 

Recording: (676/ 9621) 
 But like to some people that's considered a city. So I think it's your perspective in that sense. 

Recording: (677/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (678/ 9621) 
 Okay. It was kind of, it was different when I, because when I went in, I mean, I never had any problem with a black person or, I don't really care, you know, as long as they did their job and everything. I'm basically the same way today. 

Recording: (679/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (680/ 9621) 
 That's not enough. 

Recording: (681/ 9621) 
 What they do, they have up to four or five months, the first four or five months of pregnancy they're allowed to maintain. Once they start to show, they don't let them go to the school anymore just for the health of the baby. 

Recording: (682/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm Plus you get so many different students and well, I like just walking over here today, you know, I just Can't thought you know, I'm under how many of these people I walked by, you know, we're gonna be here in January Because you know, I because I did you know, I thought this is cool, man, you know 

Recording: (683/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I really don't know. I don't understand why they don't because to me it's the most important freedom we have and people bitch and complain all the time. But then when you ask them if they voted, they go, no, it makes no difference. Well, it makes no difference if you don't because your voice wasn't heard. When I was a political action consultant for the Ohio Education Association, I used to go around and try to get teachers involved in politics. And one of the things I would tell them is that every vote is important. John Kennedy won, if you would take all of the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation, by one vote per precinct. One vote per precinct. You know, if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts, you know, he would have lost. And so one vote does count. And I used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes. And when I was with the Ohio Education Association, I generally did school levy campaigns, and many of them are decided by one, two, seven, 18, 19 votes. If I knew the magic reason why people don't vote, I could sell that and make a fortune. But I don't know what it is. 

Recording: (684/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, because right now, you know, because he knows how to he's he's learned I'd say he knows more than most kindergartners So I don't even push anything. We don't really have a set schedule right now and I'm just letting him be creative and you know letting him help around the house and you know, just If I let him watch something it's educational based based usually. And I let him play on the computer. We'll go to different websites sometimes to check out things. And I'm amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from day to day stuff. And just listening because he's, he listens to everything. 

Recording: (685/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, but I have purposely tried to work close or do the back roads. It's nice from Hilliard you can get almost anywhere whether it be here or you know where I've been working on back roads so it's not that bad. 

Recording: (686/ 9621) 
 And he said even when he was in high school, they had police officers there. So that's not like a new thing. But he said you'd have people with knives and you'd have people with fist fights, but guns was unheard of. And I think, I don't know where this new trend is coming from. I think maybe people feel dejected in high school, I'm sure of it. I didn't feel that way, but in retrospect, I look back and I thought, I'm thinking maybe those people really felt horrible, and if every day was so traumatizing to them, that'd be, for four years, every day you're just teased or something horrible, and no one talks to you. I'm not justifying what they do at all, but I'm saying that would make them more, that would probably, in their mind, give them the reason. 

Recording: (687/ 9621) 
 He doesn't seem to have any problem. It's always been whatever she wants. I know. So far it's worked out pretty well. So I'm sure in a situation like that things are going to come up. But we'll deal with it. 

Recording: (688/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (689/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. My mom are real close. 

Recording: (690/ 9621) 
 I do art fairs. 

Recording: (691/ 9621) 
 You know, and it's just, I think that that happens so often. There's so many people, or even that whole thing with Bill Clinton, when you're talking circles around yourself, but you never say anything. 

Recording: (692/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I told them I was going to call up the TV station so they could film me crawling out the door as an OSU employee. 

Recording: (693/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (694/ 9621) 
 I check my fax machine the next day, it says, my mother's decided to accept your offer. And I thought, oh shit, I don't want this. What am I going to do now? So I ended up talking to him, and I just explained to him that he had caught me off guard and that I'd had more time to reconsider it. And it's true, because my daughter went to the doctor. And the doctor had said at that point, the baby could be here in two weeks, and that it was just not going to work for me. He was a nice man. I felt bad. And so then I gave him some ideas about how he could sell it. 

Recording: (695/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (696/ 9621) 
 Alright. 

Recording: (697/ 9621) 
 Well, one thing, you know, being, I came from basically a poor neighborhood, poor lifestyle, early life and everything, you know, so if anything, I guess it kind of made me negative towards people that had influence and had money and didn't do anything good with it, you know. I'm a firm believer that if you got something, that you should share it with other people. I don't always practice what I preach, but that'd be a good philosophy to live by. And people of other religions and everything, I learned a lot about religion when I was raised Baptist, basically, but I practice more Catholic than anything else now. But I'm generally pretty knowledgeable about Judaism and Muslims and everything just because I find it interesting. 

Recording: (698/ 9621) 
 friend who her name was, she's not really a friend, she was a teacher when I was in college, her name was Mrs. Cozy and she got pregnant and she said, everybody said, she came in one day and said, it's a girl, it's a girl, I found out it's a girl, what are you going to name her, Rosie? Rosie Cozy? You've got to be kidding, she's, I'm just putting you on. 

Recording: (699/ 9621) 
 right 

Recording: (700/ 9621) 
 I don't think it's really affected me. I mean, obviously there's more places to go shopping or to eat or there's more traffic, which I don't particularly care much for. But I don't think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other and it felt like a small community. I mean, I know in my own neighborhood, it was where you went to school with the people. At least once I went to high school, I went to public school. 

Recording: (701/ 9621) 
 What department? 

Recording: (702/ 9621) 
 And anymore, you're lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody's so busy doing their own thing. But as a world, I think that everyone has become closer because of the communication that if you don't really actually speak to the people you're hearing about it on TV or radio or via telephone or whatever. 

Recording: (703/ 9621) 
 Very, very much so. Now, 50 years ago, 25 to 50 years ago, we would tag that description rather than corporation, we would tag that as socialism. Well, in the manner we defined socialism 50 years ago, we are a very, very socialistic government today. We're no longer a democratic government as defined back there then. Yeah, we're still democratic according to our new definition that has developed over time, but it's far more socialistic. 

Recording: (704/ 9621) 
 Walks away. 

Recording: (705/ 9621) 
 Like, stay the heck out of my way, here I come. It's my world and welcome to it. 

Recording: (706/ 9621) 
 They didn't like plot any weapon or anything like that, it was just fistfight, yeah. 

Recording: (707/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (708/ 9621) 
 It was part of that I started wrestling because a lot of my friends did. 

Recording: (709/ 9621) 
 It was a nice birthday party. 

Recording: (710/ 9621) 
 Very new age. 

Recording: (711/ 9621) 
 I think it's the best thing in the world. It's a wonderful neighborhood. 

Recording: (712/ 9621) 
 They do, because he's all out for himself. 

Recording: (713/ 9621) 
 But of course, whenever they needed a ride or anything like that, they'd come to me. 

Recording: (714/ 9621) 
 No, kids just think, oh it can't happen to me, I'm invincible. 

Recording: (715/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (716/ 9621) 
 unit does it and it wasn't that I had a bad family unit it was just that there wasn't you know we never talked about it my sister and I were just talking about that because we were she goes we were like you know how did people start talking about sex and relationships and whatnot she goes you know mom and dad handed me a book I'm like they did 

Recording: (717/ 9621) 
 We were following his Jeep. We kept going and we kept going and this other GI and I were sitting in the back and I said, hey, suppose they know the German password? But anyway, we finally got out to where there was a bunch of ruined farmhouse and farm buildings and so on. And I said, well, this is it. So we, there were some GIs, infantry men around there. So we started looking around for a place to land. I mean, got our bedrolls out, so on. And the next morning, I don't know, I guess I was looking for somebody to light a fire to warm up some rice or something. Anyway, one of the first guys I saw was a guy that had worked with my wife in the office there. 

Recording: (718/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (719/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he was lucky. So. 

Recording: (720/ 9621) 
 Well, I think it was a nice thing about what we had. We had grandparents that were not necessarily, they were out of state in some cases. We didn't see them that much. We made it a part that we communicated with the grandparents regularly, and when we did, it was a special time. We emphasized the fact that kids want to do certain things, okay. They saw their mother go out and maybe do some additional things to work for that aspect. We asked them if they wanted to go on a project with the class and so forth. Fine, but you've got to participate in it too. We'll match you with what you come up with. We made them part of the owner. We gave them responsibilities. They grew up with that aspect. They learned by being around some older people, which I think was good. 

Recording: (721/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (722/ 9621) 
 Pretty much, yeah. Easy come, easy go. Follow the leader, monkey in the middle, whatever. 

Recording: (723/ 9621) 
 I mean I think that's the best way to address it. And as far as the homosexual, I think there is kids who say, well maybe I'm gay, I don't know if I'm gay or what. Well, hopefully they'll know their true identity eventually. I mean yes, some people, I mean I know men, several men who got married, had children and then they decided they were gay. Okay, were they gay before? But they did like women. 

Recording: (724/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (725/ 9621) 
 I'm currently unemployed. 

Recording: (726/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (727/ 9621) 
 You know, because that will all go away about second grade. 

Recording: (728/ 9621) 
 No, like I'm a business major and I hear the business school here is pretty good. So I wanted to take a look at that and my roommate's a business major. So he was going to show me around the, they have new buildings I guess. So he said he'd show me around there. Also, I really do, like I came down for a few games and things like that and I like the enthusiasm that people have for this place. Like Ashland's so small, there's a select group that has enthusiasm, but nothing like here. I mean this is ridiculous. Everyone's just enthusiastic about the university and even there might be things they don't like specifically about the university. You don't hear any like universal negative things about the university ever. 

Recording: (729/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (730/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (731/ 9621) 
 but 

Recording: (732/ 9621) 
 And it was just when drug culture was just starting, we learned about it in school and stuff. But no, my parents never sat down with me. Or about smoking. I mean, I never really smoked. But today with teenagers and everything so out in the open, you have to talk to them about things and just say, I want to help you. And be there for them 100%. Obviously, those parents were too busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing. So I think they're the ones to blame. I do. 

Recording: (733/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that was pretty bad. I think they... I don't know what happened. 

Recording: (734/ 9621) 
 only the only can do it. I mean, it seems like with all the technology in the world, they should be able to do something like that. But people who have guns in their home and not have them locked up or in a, you know, in a place that no child could find it, they're to blame. They are. They're to blame. That whole thing with the school out in Colorado. I forget the name of it. Yeah. But when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents were clueless, I just find that really hard to believe. If a child goes into a garage every night and you hear clanging and they're buying gun metal, then they were totally not in tune with what their kids were doing. It's one thing them having a site on the internet 

Recording: (735/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (736/ 9621) 
 I've got plenty of people. It's funny, Jason's mom asked me, so is your mom gonna come and stay with you for a week? I said no. I told my mom, she started laughing because I mean of course for her to come over and help out is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week I think we'd just kill each other. 

Recording: (737/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (738/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, it might be. 

Recording: (739/ 9621) 
 for parties so because it's actually a market it's all done outside like tonight we're going to the uh gobleth pavilion which is um it next to the hyatt theater it's really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 

Recording: (740/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's real well, it's like one of the closest bars and we go there because they have a huge patio and so you can just sit out and talk and then we play a lot of board games lately too. Like we just bought Axis and Allies, me and my roommates. 

Recording: (741/ 9621) 
 Well, I grew up with just my mom. She had four kids and I was very quiet and did very well in school. 

Recording: (742/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (743/ 9621) 
 credit card. 

Recording: (744/ 9621) 
 That's what you want. 

Recording: (745/ 9621) 
 So I just, you know, it was something I was a little familiar with anyway. And I was just looking for something part-time. 

Recording: (746/ 9621) 
 I guess that would be a slightly different part. I'm not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools, but I mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year. 

Recording: (747/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (748/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (749/ 9621) 
 Well, no, actually my mom didn't. She was a very bad cook. 

Recording: (750/ 9621) 
 Man, that hurt her to go. She thought she was neglecting me. 

Recording: (751/ 9621) 
 Plus I don't really feel like the Republican Party represents the populace at all. Like at their last political convention, like in the last presidential election in 96, they said one in ten of the delegates that were attending the convention were millionaires. Now granted, I know more than ten people and not, you know what I mean? So to me, I just feel like that's not a good representation. 

Recording: (752/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (753/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (754/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so. 

Recording: (755/ 9621) 
 And because, largely because of the fear of not knowing, and not knowing how to deal with the unseen. 

Recording: (756/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (757/ 9621) 
 I mean, Dorothy Teeter's obviously been around for a really long time. And my views are typically a little bit more democratic, but not to say that I certainly wouldn't vote for the person that I thought would do the best job. 

Recording: (758/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (759/ 9621) 
 At this point, I'm not against the urban schools, but if it was my own personal child, I would move to a suburban area until Columbus gets their act together. They are in such bad shape right now that I do think the state will take over the Columbus Public Schools in two years, yeah. They've threatened it, and if they don't pull their scores up, they will, you know. 

Recording: (760/ 9621) 
 And I've got a couple in Chicago and I have a couple in the Washington area. 

Recording: (761/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (762/ 9621) 
 Once they turn to adulthood and they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that, I don't think that has anything to do with it. 

Recording: (763/ 9621) 
 The runaways? Well, I think the youngest that I met was maybe 12. But that's, you know, still young. 

Recording: (764/ 9621) 
 Well, you know, because I have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else. But I'm sure that I didn't pay more than $3,000 on it. And it didn't cost me more than $3,000. And so if I had $5,000 or $6,000 out of it, I was happy. 

Recording: (765/ 9621) 
 I don't know, that's kind of a tricky question really. Because on one hand, obviously the kid definitely will get made fun of and teased and things like that. 

Recording: (766/ 9621) 
 Well, the thing is, there's things you can't explain. 

Recording: (767/ 9621) 
 My sister's last name is Goodnight, and when she had her first little girl, she said she was going to name her Dawn Ann. Goodnight, but she didn't. She didn't. 

Recording: (768/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (769/ 9621) 
 I had parents that everything I did was negative. They just told me I couldn't do this, couldn't do that. So what I try to do is, when anything comes up, I always think of how my parents would handle it, and I do 180 degrees. I sort of feel I'm mentally okay now, but I don't know how I got here, because I've been the other way. 

Recording: (770/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (771/ 9621) 
 Well, I think sometimes it is because the child has not ever been taught somehow or other or shown. I've always been the kind of person to believe. I never told my kids not to do something that I myself was doing. Example, smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner. Say, no, you're not old enough, but I can. Now, there are some things that the kids can't do at this age that somebody can't at another age possible I go out on a date for example. Well. He's going on that party like an eye well He's already 16 years old now wait till you're 16 years old and you'll be allowed to go to parties was by that time I'll expect you to be able you know know what to do But I mean I never did And I know well, I won't give you any examples, but anyway if I told them they couldn't do it, I would try, swearing is one of my bad habits. And I know that I would try very, very hard. I got taught one time that I better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl. But anyway, I would always, and I would apologize. If they did catch me doing something that I'd been telling them No, you cannot do I would apologize say mommy was bad and mommy did that I got soup on my mouth one time because Well What no no, I mean now if you want to hear the story and funny well DV just see but I was baking a pie and I was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie one of those that can get juicy sometimes and I hadn hadn't put any aluminum foil or anything to catch it and just as I started to get it out I spilled it and I said a bad word you know and just as I said that word leaning down here, here's two little shoes of 

Recording: (772/ 9621) 
 The same thing, I think they're terrific for the right things. 

Recording: (773/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (774/ 9621) 
 Freshman. 

Recording: (775/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (776/ 9621) 
 heaven forbid, but I'm sitting here going, I mean, I didn't even know what I was doing. 

Recording: (777/ 9621) 
 We sat there then for—oh, and it was kind of funny. We were going—another guy and I and the lieutenant, who was a forward observer, were going out to a forward observation post, and the observation lieutenant, whatever his title was, was guiding—he was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him. And of course, we just had these little red blackout lights, they called them. 

Recording: (778/ 9621) 
 She really likes it well, yeah. 

Recording: (779/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (780/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (781/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (782/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (783/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (784/ 9621) 
 And it's just the same as when I was a kid. 

Recording: (785/ 9621) 
 So what kind of doctor do you want to be? I've got a few ideas. I'm thinking I might be an OBGYN. 

Recording: (786/ 9621) 
 sitting back waiting. 

Recording: (787/ 9621) 
 And then, but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house, and he came out crying. I mean, it was on TV. It was like heart-wrenching. 

Recording: (788/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (789/ 9621) 
 et 

Recording: (790/ 9621) 
 But they said all along they were gay. They just fought it. And they didn't want the pressure from their families. 

Recording: (791/ 9621) 
 I think so. I think so. It's so sad to see a girl, you know, have so many options closed off. I don't mean it by any stretch that it's a tragedy to have a baby, but somebody in high school is making a lot of decisions she doesn't intend to make. 

Recording: (792/ 9621) 
 Really. 

Recording: (793/ 9621) 
 because again I said you get wisdom from that as long as you're listening to them. Some people, I don't care what their age is, they just blow them off. So that, plus you have the, I think, an understanding of the schooling they came from. 

Recording: (794/ 9621) 
 familiar with Sarcom, yes. 

Recording: (795/ 9621) 
 I do have some relatives that are step, my step-mom's relatives that are there. They're actually members of the Mormon Church. 

Recording: (796/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's, I mean, you just know where it goes and you throw it in and there it is. Let's see what was my decoder card was a little more difficult. I had somebody else do it for me. 

Recording: (797/ 9621) 
 Oh, good. 

Recording: (798/ 9621) 
 It ain't that far, it's uh... 

Recording: (799/ 9621) 
 I just can't believe and they said they didn't even know it was going on. 

Recording: (800/ 9621) 
 I'm building $200,000 houses everywhere around me. 

Recording: (801/ 9621) 
 on different topics. 

Recording: (802/ 9621) 
 I see it working unfairly. 

Recording: (803/ 9621) 
 I'm sure Australia welcomes all those dollars, but they have a little wedding industry. 

Recording: (804/ 9621) 
 A famous one. 

Recording: (805/ 9621) 
 I've never heard anybody go on a shooting rampage that were high on pot. Most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza. 

Recording: (806/ 9621) 
 gave me these leading questions. I said, ah, I know where you're coming from. I've been confronted with that when I was at Ohio State and so forth. And so I just laid it on the line to her. 

Recording: (807/ 9621) 
 I got on birth control probably when I was like 16 or 17. But still, I didn't take the pills all the time. And that wasn't very good for me either. 

Recording: (808/ 9621) 
 It's like some of these places in Florida, kind of like ruined by tourists, like Fort Lauderdale, Daytona. It's like after the kids get done, they just like, well, forget it. It's like, because I used to, when I was in, like a freshman, I heard like, don't even go to Florida, because they do not want students. They want your money, but they don't like the trash and whatnot that they bring. 

Recording: (809/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (810/ 9621) 
 Depends on who the manager is at the time. Every manager's got a different agenda on what they want you to do. 

Recording: (811/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (812/ 9621) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (813/ 9621) 
 She sort of knows. This is what she has to say at school if she's asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade. 

Recording: (814/ 9621) 
 The one girl had showed her ultrasound and then that's when it was like, oh, that's so cute. And I'm like, well, wait a minute. I thought you was against it. They're not always against it, though. 

Recording: (815/ 9621) 
 You know, we're right there within moments. If there's a flood or something like that, you call the contractor. I'll be in Thursday, if you're air conditioned. So, they're always gonna have to have people here. So I just feel they're either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people than have 20 people that half of them know what's going on, half of them don't. But that's tough to do when you're starting people at $8 an hour and stuff So there's you know, Wendy's McDonald's there's places that you can make that money. So Mm-hmm my you know to me the thing that hurt me the most out of it is they want to put caps on our salaries So I'm at the highest scale I can go right now as far as job title There's no other job I can move to unless I move into Supervision or something up in there and I'll be out of the Union if I do that anyway So but they're gonna put a cap on that where you can only make so much money at a point which I'm almost there right now I'm only like 50 cents away from that cap. And if that's the case if I retire in six years I'll be capped out right now. So in other words, I'm going to retire in six years if I don't change jobs, making exactly what I make now, which that was my worst fear of it all. But that wasn't even on the negotiating table. They were still worried about this $2 and get this hospital. Yeah, that's what they were fighting for was the low end and try to get the hospital and the main campus the same. 

Recording: (816/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so it's a really tough thing to do. I mean, you have to be sort of organized and I don't know, sort of a maverick, I guess, because if you could give a test that would tell who could be an air traffic controller and who couldn't, you'd be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you. Because intelligence is not a factor. I mean, there are people who do this job who, I mean, are not stupid, but they're not college educated and really intelligent but they're extremely good at it and then the other people that I know of one that I work with it on a regular basis he has got a master's degree and he's you know he reads continuously he's always up I mean if you ask him anything about like what's going on overseas or anywhere he knows that like the back of his hand but he's one of our weakest ones you know and it's 

Recording: (817/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (818/ 9621) 
 in the way of benefits. 

Recording: (819/ 9621) 
 My bill collectors are the ones that are scared of that. 

Recording: (820/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (821/ 9621) 
 No, I wanted to see her obviously, but. 

Recording: (822/ 9621) 
 Oh gosh, he just kept saying gas, gas, gas. And I kept saying I don't want to guess. This is the first day of school. I got lots of stuff to do. We don't have time to play guessing games. I said spell your last name. He said G-U-E-S-S. Talk about feeling stupid. 

Recording: (823/ 9621) 
 But to go see something like Cats or Rent, they'd still charge you out the bus. Really? Okay. 

Recording: (824/ 9621) 
 Um, 

Recording: (825/ 9621) 
 Cause you gotta trust the people you're around, you don't really wanna piss them off. 

Recording: (826/ 9621) 
 I'm working on three different research projects with three different physicians. Two are specific to the Traumatic Brain Injury Service, looking at long-term outcomes in people that have sustained traumatic brain injuries. The other one is a drug study looking at control of agitation. And the other one is a spinal cord injury research study. 

Recording: (827/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (828/ 9621) 
 Which is great. 

Recording: (829/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (830/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (831/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think I got really good. I've actually been sitting thinking about it, like what departments in the school were good and which ones weren't. The foreign language is really good. They have immersion classes from like second level. 

Recording: (832/ 9621) 
 Again, they set different rules. 

Recording: (833/ 9621) 
 It wasn't really farming country. And he went out there from Iowa where you throw a corn out in the field. 

Recording: (834/ 9621) 
 There are two elderly women at the church. This has been about seven or eight years ago. Father just mentioned that they had a need. They had had a church bus and it had broken down, so they had a need to get people to church. And I met these two elderly women. Now, the one now is 90. She turned 90 last October. And the other one is about 78 now. And they live together and I take them to church on Sunday. 

Recording: (835/ 9621) 
 It might have been where the president lived. They sometimes have like a mission home. 

Recording: (836/ 9621) 
 for whatever reason. 

Recording: (837/ 9621) 
 And I imagine that's about half and half right now, or maybe it's more on this side. I don't know So I think that that really is ever in evolution at this time tell you the truth What's going to cause the world end I? Think what they really mean, but by that I hope what they mean by that is that it will end the way it's being Run or the way it's being acted out today and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be happy and content. And I still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there's a God and believing that you should take the other person into consideration. It might sound very basic, but it's a very hard thing to accomplish, especially when you've gotten into this, like you said, me, me me me me and I got to have this and that status symbol stuff and really if We older people could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids Because I know I myself in my own home. I've been a collector and I take this back to the depression years When I didn't have anything and my father one time when he's out of work guess what I don't know what welfare agency it was but they brought us our Christmas dinner and the first doll baby I ever had and I remember when I tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water and when my mother said well if you don't know how to take care of it any better than that I'll never buy you another one and believe me she didn't 

Recording: (838/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (839/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (840/ 9621) 
 See there, I think there has to be a quality to life too. 

Recording: (841/ 9621) 
 and it makes you a better person because you get the spirituality inside you driving you and that's what's going to take you home. I often ask the people, you asked me about marketing. 

Recording: (842/ 9621) 
 Like and, the, of, is, all those little words, you're already supposed to know those. You're supposed to be able to write a sentence, even if it's just a little short sentence like my name is Joanne. I live at blah, blah, blah street. I mean, it's incredible. It's like the curriculum keeps moving down and down and down. 

Recording: (843/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (844/ 9621) 
 Fry 

Recording: (845/ 9621) 
 I didn't, I really didn't want to go to school. 

Recording: (846/ 9621) 
 Kaffee 

Recording: (847/ 9621) 
 Yeah, just one concert. 

Recording: (848/ 9621) 
 As long as you, see I already knew I was gonna be getting a notice, so, because I flunked out like in December, you know, and so in January I had already contacted the Navy and the Air Force about getting into, they were taking their tests and everything, taking their physicals, so. 

Recording: (849/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (850/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (851/ 9621) 
 You had a harvest, didn't you? 

Recording: (852/ 9621) 
 and I mean it's basically anytime I have free I mean it's not like I have a set schedule of when I have to work and things like that it's just whenever I feel like I have to do it. 

Recording: (853/ 9621) 
 None whatsoever. 

Recording: (854/ 9621) 
 and just totally bombarded. And I mean here it's so force fed as well. I mean I came home just before Halloween and you know I walked into the grocery store and I mean just like right there were just like cakes, cupcakes, cookies, like everything just right in front of you with like all this Halloween stuff on. And I mean all the holidays in here are so pushed at you and it's such a money making you know and it's so over so over the top. Where there, it's sort of like, there's a little bit of that. And there are decorations and stuff at Christmas, but it isn't so much, you know, and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around, I mean, there isn't that at all. I mean, at least in, you know, my experience there. And I mean, I can't imagine, because, you know, Western Europe, I think, is sort of as much like America as you can get probably, you know, most places elsewhere in the world. And I mean, that would have been a fantastic experience. 

Recording: (855/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (856/ 9621) 
 the West Side. 

Recording: (857/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (858/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (859/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (860/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (861/ 9621) 
 Not really, no I was too proud. I would have never, I would have never. I think my dad paid my first month's rent for me though. I paid him back and then I never, I never wanted to borrow any money. I guess just growing up, the youngest of five, I appreciated money. 

Recording: (862/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (863/ 9621) 
 Hi, I'm a perchable. 

Recording: (864/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (865/ 9621) 
 My father died when I was two, so I think just being raised by a single parent. 

Recording: (866/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (867/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, yeah very much so. 

Recording: (868/ 9621) 
 I just actually I was going to send my son to a Christian kindergarten, but I decided to homeschool instead. So I've been homeschooling him for kindergarten. 

Recording: (869/ 9621) 
 Trash is picking up, what movies are playing, but I don't really rely on Heavenly for news. 

Recording: (870/ 9621) 
 And so, you know, even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown, it's not because I have to. It's not because he, you know, he wouldn't do something else. This suits me fine. 

Recording: (871/ 9621) 
 And unfortunately, they have to do what the people, the pets say. But it's just, I couldn't be around that. And I would go off on people that would do that, bring that in. I just feel that would be the right thing to do, punch them in the mouth sometimes. I'm not a violent man either, even as big as I am. 

Recording: (872/ 9621) 
 better than us I guess. 

Recording: (873/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (874/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (875/ 9621) 
 I'm a senior consulting database specialist. I work for a company called OCLC. It's in Dublin. I work in, it's hard to say what I do, I consult on a lot of projects. 

Recording: (876/ 9621) 
 Haha. 

Recording: (877/ 9621) 
 We both love sports. We love college football. 

Recording: (878/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (879/ 9621) 
 as much as she could. We were poor, but we managed. 

Recording: (880/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think that he's right that my generation was more, I don't want to say spiritual, but more morally well-directed than at least a lot of the kids today. 

Recording: (881/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (882/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (883/ 9621) 
 you know, so you get a look at them, which is very disrespectful. But, you know, there's some psychos out there, man. I mean, there's some psycho around here in town called Rainbow Eagle, gave himself that name. 

Recording: (884/ 9621) 
 to be a rat. 

Recording: (885/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (886/ 9621) 
 I just, he did talk to one of his friends who he wasn't really, didn't really know that this friend's mother and I grew up together. So he asked if he could move into their house and the mother said there were three things. One, I need something in writing from your parents. Two, I need to talk to your parents. And three, there are rules you'll have to obey. 

Recording: (887/ 9621) 
 It's kind of a fun game. It's just strange because I came down in semesters, so there was still a month where everyone was down here. And now there's nobody down here. So it's myself, my two roommates, and maybe a handful of other people that we know. So the social aspect has diminished a lot. But that's still, I mean, for fun, we play a lot of video games. I guess you'd think the natural things you would expect from a college guy. 

Recording: (888/ 9621) 
 Wow, you taught psychology? 

Recording: (889/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (890/ 9621) 
 It's like a car dealer that goes, you know, the CD player with blah, blah, blah, blah, will only raise your payment another $8. And you're like, yeah, but that's about the 14th $8 you've added onto this, you know, and it all adds up. 

Recording: (891/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (892/ 9621) 
 As far as affiliated with a party, I probably respond to Republicans more than Democrats, but I think given any choice of any party at all, I'm probably more libertarian than anything else. 

Recording: (893/ 9621) 
 So when he was a junior, then he started in high school, he started really seriously thinking, I got to get it together. What am I going to do? So he agreed to go to a psychiatrist. And so he went on Ritalin. So he took the Ritalin through his last of his junior year and his senior year. Now he's on a medication they call Welbutrin. His doctor doesn't believe in Ridland. 

Recording: (894/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was painful, but no worse since going to the hospital for my back surgery. My back surgery was worse than a heart attack ever was. 

Recording: (895/ 9621) 
 And these people that hear voices, they're not hallucinating. They're hearing voices of spirits. And in many cultures, they'll tell you, most of the indigenous cultures throughout the world will tell you, and the history will show, that those people were revered as gifted. 

Recording: (896/ 9621) 
 Weekends I usually try and keep free so that I can mix stuff up. I don't know. Weekends are usually the one day of the week that isn't horribly well scheduled. Wednesday nights are preparing for travel. 

Recording: (897/ 9621) 
 Some places you're allowed to wear sandals. 

Recording: (898/ 9621) 
 Or they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school. 

Recording: (899/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (900/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (901/ 9621) 
 He had an aneurysm. He had a high blood pressure, which we knew about. And he started, you know, not being himself. So he went to the doctor and they did some tests and found out he had this aneurysm that had to be operated on right away. And he died under the anesthetic of a heart attack. So it was very sudden and unexpected. 

Recording: (902/ 9621) 
 This has a set up where they have safe places where kids can go when they run away. 

Recording: (903/ 9621) 
 Um, honestly, I can't say it really bothers me too much. Um, I mean as far as just dealing with gay people or whatever, it doesn't bother me at all. It's just something I don't want to deal with or whatnot. Um, so I mean, the fact that, I mean, two people of the same sex are living together or married or whatnot, that doesn't bother me. Like I said, it's just more something that... I don't know, it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if I see, like, two guys holding hands or whatnot. It's... I think it's just more because it's so different than, like, what you normally see or things like that. 

Recording: (904/ 9621) 
 You can't explain that. And those have been questions I've been asked by our children. Well, how did your mom know? Well, gee, how do you know? Well, hey, that's one of the risks in life, marriage. But the thing is, do you want to make it work? 

Recording: (905/ 9621) 
 No, humans are violent by nature, I believe. I mean, people have been at war since the beginning of man. It's more or less greed that causes violence. It's not media. Just like the ecstasy was an advertisement showing what you could do, TV's showing you violence that you could do if you're driven to it. 

Recording: (906/ 9621) 
 that it's still really going on, you know, and his parents accepted him. 

Recording: (907/ 9621) 
 No. What do you think is wrong with it? With the system? 

Recording: (908/ 9621) 
 You know, they all get sidelined and sidetracked by special private interests. And that's the bottom line. And it's sad, but there's... So I choose not to involve myself in that as much as possible. We ended up settling for 

Recording: (909/ 9621) 
 So it was neat though because Pete was, my mom was 29 and Pete was 18. And so Pete was just like some kid who liked to play. You know, we'd go and fly kites and do all this fun stuff. 

Recording: (910/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like underground. Now it's gotten real big. Like it's still different too. There's still like a really big scene and there's still like a smaller underground scene like 

Recording: (911/ 9621) 
 You do too. 

Recording: (912/ 9621) 
 Obviously, I mean, it's just something that, just, I mean, you don't really appreciate it until you've gone through it. 

Recording: (913/ 9621) 
 But. 

Recording: (914/ 9621) 
 We're having like three concerts next month. 

Recording: (915/ 9621) 
 Youngest. 

Recording: (916/ 9621) 
 Status symbol. 

Recording: (917/ 9621) 
 And telecommunications is very much like a highway. You need to know what your load's going to be before you construct it or otherwise your planning's way off. Well, nowadays we're in a position where we're doing more advancement than anything. Our agency is the only one in the state of Ohio and the private network, as a private sector, is still looking at us as a showcase. We're doing voice over IP, Internet Protocol, which means we're doing voice and data over the same pipe and the long line carriers, they don't even know how to bill us. 

Recording: (918/ 9621) 
 I think when I was five because it was like yeah Yeah, I don't really remember them being really together 

Recording: (919/ 9621) 
 It's more of, it tends to be more of entertainment. I don't remember that being that way 30 years ago, but it does now. 

Recording: (920/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (921/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (922/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (923/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (924/ 9621) 
 We take them to Wyandotte Lake or the zoo or all types of things. The best thing, you gotta get a membership to everything. That's what we figured out. We got COSI, we got the zoo, and we got Wyandotte Lake. And that way you can go whenever you want. If an hour into the show they're not participating properly, you can leave and you're not out anything. COSI is great. We really like that. They've really 

Recording: (925/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (926/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (927/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (928/ 9621) 
 Right, and I was also robbed about three times delivering pizzas for Domino's in the campus area, really. A couple of times were down a little bit south of campus, 4th Street and 5th Avenue near there, 4th Street and 7th. But once was right on, practically on campus, 16th Avenue near High Street. I was robbed there once. Yeah, near that United Christian Center. It's right there on 15th Avenue. 

Recording: (929/ 9621) 
 I'm living over on IUCAA. If you, on the other side of High Street, you know the McDonald's right by High Street? It's like 

Recording: (930/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (931/ 9621) 
 What I've liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then you find out that it's not right and that is wrong. I mean there was the episode 

Recording: (932/ 9621) 
 Well, maybe not Columbus in particular, but I don't know. I think I was just a little burnt out because I was doing the two majors and I had a heavy course load every quarter and I had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done. And so I had done seven straight quarters and I'm sure that added to it. I had a lot of hard classes and I was just tired of Ohio State and tired of being here and red tape. 

Recording: (933/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (934/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (935/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (936/ 9621) 
 I don't believe that. 

Recording: (937/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (938/ 9621) 
 And they have these fads that go through. And somebody asked me my opinion about the Pokemon. I said, oh, brother, you know, it couldn't be any worse than what was those turtles that lived in the sewers? 

Recording: (939/ 9621) 
 I just want to start laughing real loud you can turn it down so no one breaks their eardrums. 

Recording: (940/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (941/ 9621) 
 They didn't bring that. He only gave 10 cents. 

Recording: (942/ 9621) 
 And it was fun, and we made about 9,000 of it by the time we were done. 

Recording: (943/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're very quantitative as opposed to like the quality and then so the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because actually that's why I don't like like I like business and I I enjoy my business classes, but some of the people in my business classes I cannot stand because they honestly they're like, oh it doesn't matter how you treat people and then it's all about the bottom line Well, though in my opinion, they'll end up losing more because it costs a lot to hire a new employee and if you have constant turnover, things like that, then if you have a product that, because obviously people aren't going to care, you know, so. And they seem very closed-minded, like this is the way business has to be. But the professors don't seem to be necessarily like that. Maybe I'm coming too far, going to one extreme. 

Recording: (944/ 9621) 
 She graduated last year, but she went home. She was on home study. 

Recording: (945/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (946/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (947/ 9621) 
 I mean it's something he has to deal with, he has to deal with the problems with. 

Recording: (948/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (949/ 9621) 
 and you've been going to Ohio State that whole time. 

Recording: (950/ 9621) 
 And people don't seem to understand that. It's not like you're collecting data for the entire population or the entire universe. You're working with a sample trying to represent the entire universe. Well, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. 

Recording: (951/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. 

Recording: (952/ 9621) 
 I mean 

Recording: (953/ 9621) 
 even in the package of information. 

Recording: (954/ 9621) 
 take them to the grocery store afterwards usually. So it does take up a big part of Sunday. And I don't do it as regularly now because of the advance in age, you know. 

Recording: (955/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, and that was really a struggle for money and everything. So I would take whatever would come along. And when you work in secure jobs like that, I mean, I had a different job every year. I mean, a year would come up and I'd say, OK, here we go. They're either going to downsize or they're going to do something. And they always did. So I was never really shocked. And I didn't panic or anything. And I was never without a job. I never had to, I never missed, you know, I would say it would take probably two weeks at the most before I would be working again. Yeah. 

Recording: (956/ 9621) 
 You 

Recording: (957/ 9621) 
 Yeah, a lot of educated people who aren't out to just make a bunch of money. So it makes for a very intellectual, interesting environment. But people are trying to live simply there. And I kind of agree with that. 

Recording: (958/ 9621) 
 Yes you are, you're saying you don't need to have a leader in a family. And if I'm going to be a leader, I'm going to be the one, I'm going to be the one, not the sperm bank. Oh, you came from this little tube here. Oh, okay, that's the principle of family. No, I have to be because there's no father here. 

Recording: (959/ 9621) 
 There were six of us born out there. 

Recording: (960/ 9621) 
 at the age of 10. 

Recording: (961/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (962/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (963/ 9621) 
 I would say family, values, customs, traditions, divorce, moving, just looking at my sister. My sister, I mean, she's very happily married, but my God, I mean, they lived here in Columbus. He's from Dallas. They met here. They moved to Indianapolis. They moved back here. They moved up north. they moved back. Now they're in London, England. They've been married what, four or five years? And I think they've lived six different places. They're just constantly on the move. They just don't have the connection with the family and I don't know if that's a bad thing. It's just they aren't 

Recording: (964/ 9621) 
 and like the social aspects of it were the problem. 

Recording: (965/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (966/ 9621) 
 We'll see. 

Recording: (967/ 9621) 
 She doesn't have any kids and she works and he works. So everybody does pretty good now. 

Recording: (968/ 9621) 
 So they're kind of spread out 25, 25, 10% is kind of how it's divided out between the projects. 

Recording: (969/ 9621) 
 That's an interesting question because he was a serious contender last time. I haven't heard his name this time. What people say they would do is that they like him because he is intelligent, charismatic, all those neat things that you need to be elected today. And a lot of people said they would vote for him. But what they say in polls, I don't know if it would translate over. But yeah, I think he could. I think the right candidate could. And I think Mike Coleman this year in the Columbus race showed that. I mean, he crossed gender lines. He crossed party lines. He crossed over into all of the city and winning even Dorothy Teeter's precinct, which surprised me. And not by just a little small margin. I think it was 200 and some votes, which is pretty substantial. 

Recording: (970/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (971/ 9621) 
 Well, is there any kind of training? Are they doing the whole job training after the two years or during the two years? 

Recording: (972/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (973/ 9621) 
 And I think there's a whole bunch of people that just don't want to spend any extra money on anything. We're already paying for enough of things. We don't want to do this. 

Recording: (974/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (975/ 9621) 
 Really, you know, it's half a million dollars still out of our range. 

Recording: (976/ 9621) 
 And there was a lot of alcoholics in the military when I was in there. 

Recording: (977/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (978/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (979/ 9621) 
 Yeah. I don't really have any childhood recollections of California. Yeah. 

Recording: (980/ 9621) 
 You know, it just didn't even matter because you look at the wall right there, it's pretty much all you've seen. You'd see taillights as you passed. People at the side of the road, we was the only people on the road. 

Recording: (981/ 9621) 
 laughs 

Recording: (982/ 9621) 
 which are children of light. 

Recording: (983/ 9621) 
 Once upon a time, there was a gentleman named **** and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot. 

Recording: (984/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (985/ 9621) 
 How do you picture it? 

Recording: (986/ 9621) 
 I think what they were protesting was that they weren't being involved in it. Wasn't that part of their protest? 

Recording: (987/ 9621) 
 Oh yes, they're getting better though, they really are. They're much better now than they were 20 years ago. Because the trend is to keep these students in the mainstream as much as possible. So teachers are having to learn to, for example, 

Recording: (988/ 9621) 
 And yeah, yeah, I shouldn't have done that. So now let's just go get some more furniture. 

Recording: (989/ 9621) 
 Mm hmm. Right. And they're in so much competition. Mm hmm. 

Recording: (990/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure. It's usually the girls look younger than guys, I guess. I don't know. 

Recording: (991/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (992/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (993/ 9621) 
 I mean, that was a different time, you know, so nowadays it's a lot different, you know. 

Recording: (994/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Recording: (995/ 9621) 
 They don't have any like endangered, they're not like on an endangered species list where you can't like. 

Recording: (996/ 9621) 
 Of course, everybody else could, but basically what it was, it was a weird situation in high school. 

Recording: (997/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (998/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, I don't know. But then they second guess the mother and she risked her life. They can't do that. I mean, you know, it's too bad that she wasn't there to go on with what they were planning on doing, but it's not our right to take other countries' kids even. I mean, that's another thing. I mean, come to America, we'll take everyone and every, you know. But then we have all this crime because we have all these terrorist people that come from, I mean, that's all they've grown up with is the terrorist activities and the mentality and all that. They come here and if they can't make it, then they'll just bomb somewhere and then fire. But I see a lot of that too. A lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that, you know, you kind of want to do a study of how long they've been here and it'd be interesting. Oh, I think there's got to be a line drawn. And I think that if they're caught in any kind of crime or anything, and I know they send them back, but I just think that we're just too open with that and there's got to be a line to say this is as many people as we care to, you know. I mean, I know that's hard, but, and it's hard to draw the line, but then other countries, if it's so miserable there, then they need to work on their country, because, 

Recording: (999/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1000/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1001/ 9621) 
 I think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and look all over the place for different plays. You look on the screen, it's different. You say, well, I would have done this and this and this. But down on the field, they have to think that they're going to be doing this. 

Recording: (1002/ 9621) 
 that the levee didn't pass. Let's see. Boy, I don't know. I mean, we've got a great airport with great connections and cheap flights everywhere. That's no drawback. We're not isolated. Boy, I don't know. 

Recording: (1003/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1004/ 9621) 
 My wife and I had been to San Francisco a couple times. The first time was did all the tourist things. And the next time I said, well, let's just go and wander around and see. And we spent more time. Both of them are good for different reasons. 

Recording: (1005/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1006/ 9621) 
 Guns should definitely be kept in a lockbox where kids can't get them. Besides that, there's not a whole lot that government can do. It's more the parents' responsibility to keep the guns out of their kids' hands. 

Recording: (1007/ 9621) 
 you know, that's his real father. So I got to sit there and keep my mouth shut. 

Recording: (1008/ 9621) 
 I haven't taken him there yet. 

Recording: (1009/ 9621) 
 Something like that. I don't know much about it. 

Recording: (1010/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (1011/ 9621) 
 So I ended up doing that for about three months and ended up plunking out of OU in the first three months of the first quarter. So then I got my notice in January. 

Recording: (1012/ 9621) 
 I mean, there are people who think cars won't run. 

Recording: (1013/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we need to pay the rent and that's, yeah. 

Recording: (1014/ 9621) 
 So we've even been known to slightly start pulling out, you know, let the garage door go down. I'd sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she's on the couch and she's like, I'm caught. It's hilarious. 

Recording: (1015/ 9621) 
 And then I got my master's in 75. So it took me four years that way. No, I never, I just was smart enough to do it before I had kids. 

Recording: (1016/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1017/ 9621) 
 And apparently that's a way of initiating a conversation. One of the guys I usually go clubbing with, he's the one who got me into the low stick dancing. And he said, there's like a sign that says, come hit on me. And I'm like, oh, great. That's just what I need. Doesn't bother you at all? Nah, it doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me. I just, I sort of just, I'm just like, nah, you know, I'm straight. If they start getting really, you know, really pushy about it, I'm just like, I'm straight. But a lot of times it's really funny because I'll get in a conversation with them and they'll be like, you're straight, aren't you? I'm like, yeah. Yeah, I don't know how, but they must, it's just being, I guess it must be the way I talk or something. But I think I keep a lot of them away because I do a lot of really robust movements with my glow sticks. So I'm like fl and you know it's like this yeah I got this wide berth around me. Yeah it's not one of these that's a good point. 

Recording: (1018/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1019/ 9621) 
 Oh, not very right. And the first 20 years I worked at the Bureau, I worked in statistics. So I learned a lot about numbers and how to use them and what you can do with them and how easily they're misinterpreted. And my wife has been the director of institutional research at the university, data research. They don't really have other kinds of research there. 

Recording: (1020/ 9621) 
 you know, or a conversation piece, you know, or some kind of trophy. Well, here's my dog, my Labrador. Yeah, full. And a lot of these people were, the dogs were reacting and they were objective, you know, and they were, because they weren't being paid attention to, and they were pissing on the carpet and making messes and chewing things up. And these people would bring them in and have them put to sleep. 

Recording: (1021/ 9621) 
 So you take care of your granddaughter? you know, after the baby comes, she will need to work. I have custody of another grandchild. My son, when he was in high school, had a little girlfriend and she was, let's see, he was 10th grade and she was 9th grade, I guess. She had a baby and I believe my son was in 11th grade when that baby was born. And she had a lot of problems running away from home. My son left to move into the dorm here at OSU and she moved in with me. I think the baby was 15 months old, and I tried to help the young lady, and it just turned out that the young lady was not ready to be a mother. My son, even now, isn't ready to be a father. So there was a whole investigation through Children's Services and they gave me custody of the child temporarily. And she's still there. She's four and a half. The mother's married and has another child now and the little one's still with me. 

Recording: (1022/ 9621) 
 Well, no, they don't. 

Recording: (1023/ 9621) 
 Not as an individual. Well, I say that's a problem. It's hard to find a balance between censorship and free flow of information. And as long as people, I mean, some people like this information. Jerry Springer is still running, which I actually kind of enjoy watching once in a while. It's kind of interesting to watch these people. But I mean, where do you draw the line where people should see and not see? I don't know. I don't want somebody telling me I can see something or telling me what my kids can see. That's my job. And if I don't want to see something on TV, I'll turn it off. If I don't want my kids to see something on TV, we'll have an argument. It used to be easy when they were little. You know, dealing with a 21-year-old and an 18-year-old is not as easy. 

Recording: (1024/ 9621) 
 for like a summer project or something. 

Recording: (1025/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1026/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1027/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1028/ 9621) 
 If they want to get married, that's their business. I don't think it's mine or anyone else's to say that they can't. 

Recording: (1029/ 9621) 
 really. 

Recording: (1030/ 9621) 
 I think more along the lines of physical abuses, things like that, would be probably crossing the line. Like if he got, there were alleged, excuse me, if he was allegedly beating his wife or something like that, obviously, then that would cause a problem with me. I can't say that I would vote for anyone like that. But, mean just like small things like that where it doesn't really threaten the nation or anything and I mean it's something that happened. 

Recording: (1031/ 9621) 
 I have one at Northland High School, she's a sophomore there, and the one at OU is a freshman. I'm married, and I live in Northeast Columbus, by 71 and 161. That's about it. 

Recording: (1032/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1033/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (1034/ 9621) 
 getting married, having kids, you know, and having a nice place to live. 

Recording: (1035/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (1036/ 9621) 
 Yeah, all my family still lives around me, pretty much, yeah. 

Recording: (1037/ 9621) 
 And it only took less than two months. 

Recording: (1038/ 9621) 
 Donate so much... Okay, well, you remember back sometime there were 90% tax brackets and so forth. So that means 90 cents on that dollar he gave. 

Recording: (1039/ 9621) 
 People graduate, get degrees from Ohio State, working here, taking one course a quarter and get a degree in history or whatever. It might take them 10 years or something, but it's like, why not? It's free. 

Recording: (1040/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1041/ 9621) 
 Where I live now, I've lived there for 11 years. 

Recording: (1042/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (1043/ 9621) 
 I thought maybe you would crash one of their weddings. 

Recording: (1044/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Recording: (1045/ 9621) 
 But I've been in situations where people have told racist jokes and sometimes I let it pass. You do have to pick the time to challenge someone very carefully. But in other situations I've said I don't find those types of jokes funny. Please don't tell them anymore in my presence. Do what you want when you're with your other friends but don't do it in front of me. I don't even like blonde jokes. I find those sexist and racist in a way. And no will tell them to me. One day when I was still working and in an office, they were telling 15 or 20 of them in a row. I just kept a stone face, but at one or two I did kind of smile, but they were trying to get me to laugh, and I wouldn't. 

Recording: (1046/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1047/ 9621) 
 Okay, how do you get back to the original without being part of the original? 

Recording: (1048/ 9621) 
 I think a lot of people don't understand, a lot of people don't, it's a mindset. They don't want to deal with numbers, a lot of people, or they want something easy and simple. And that's what they're looking for. They don't really want to know what it means. And a statistic under any term, any definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind. 

Recording: (1049/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was like freshman or sophomore year. 

Recording: (1050/ 9621) 
 while saying while poo-pooing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff. As far as bringing the two together like socially I think that's just a rough age. 

Recording: (1051/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1052/ 9621) 
 I can argue both sides of that. I'm at a luxury, I guess, where we're in a position where I truly don't have to work. So if I ever felt that he was in jeopardy or he wasn't getting what he wanted or needed, I would quit in a heartbeat to take care of that. But having family with him the first year and a half, I don't know, I got all my schooling, everything out of the way. I Cut down to the 60% when he was born to have more time with him I Don't know it's a whole different society with emails and the computer and the internet and the cell phones, I mean it's in some regards. It's's much more connected but so impersonal. I think moms being outside the home, I think so many families are forced to do that with the cost. Is it the cost or is it the wants? It's a very material society right now but it's also a very good economical time too. The stock market overall has been up. I know it's down right now but overall so the money's been flying and houses and buildings and 

Recording: (1053/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I would I'd say you know life application things would definitely need to be part of it. I don't think that you should throw out English or math or you know, I can't believe I'm saying this history, but I don't think you should throw out that stuff, but I don't think that there should be as much emphasis on it. I think more of the emphasis should be on life skills and just being able to make it on your own and take care of yourself. But definitely I think that those other 

Recording: (1054/ 9621) 
 you know I mean it was just like and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else so you would never want to you know ever say anything but yeah that 

Recording: (1055/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, well, I don't know. 

Recording: (1056/ 9621) 
 What? We're animals! 

Recording: (1057/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1058/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1059/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1060/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1061/ 9621) 
 I don't think I would want my kid to go to daycare. Crazy. 

Recording: (1062/ 9621) 
 I don't know how that's even possible. 

Recording: (1063/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1064/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1065/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1066/ 9621) 
 No. I pray at night. You know, I don't think he knows what I'm praying to or anything like that. 

Recording: (1067/ 9621) 
 But I. 

Recording: (1068/ 9621) 
 one. 

Recording: (1069/ 9621) 
 they get caught with that stuff and nothing happens and it's just such a horrible example that here you've got some 18 year old kid that does something really stupid and he's 10 years in jail and then you've got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can be elected. It's just so wrong. 

Recording: (1070/ 9621) 
 Which one of them? 

Recording: (1071/ 9621) 
 I'm right. 

Recording: (1072/ 9621) 
 I said, are you kidding me? I studied the weather and I know about it. You're going to tell me that fog pushed that two foot pine tree across the way? I mean, it was a thick tree too. And we get up to the next gas station. He fills up and I listened on the intercom. They had news on there, weather and stuff. Tornado warning in that County. that County I turned around I said now see who's the dumbass here I said I bet you don't even know how to spell Cirrus cloud or 

Recording: (1073/ 9621) 
 for their behavior because if they were an asshole before their brain injury, they're going to be an asshole after their brain injury five times. 

Recording: (1074/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1075/ 9621) 
 I think it's because parents are at work and they're busy making money and they're not teaching their kids any, I mean they're not teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal, you know, thanks for having me when you go to someone's house. Just the normal, I can't tell you how many kids I've picked up and driven home when I picked up my son because it was raining or something and they just jump out of the car and go bye, slam the door. I turn to my son and I go, don't you ever do that to someone's mother. Now how bad do you think I want to give him another ride home when he didn't even say thank you? You know, I didn't have to bother to go out of my way. And I'd always try to use that as a way to explain to my kids, okay, you know, this is how he handled it, this is how I want you to handle it. I don't ever want you to go to someone's house and not say, thanks for inviting me, thanks for having me, I really had a good time, you know, and I don't ever want you to sit at somebody else's table and go, yuck, I don't like that. You know, if they're having something for supper you don't like, you pass it on and you go, I don't care for any thank you. You know, make a big scene like so-and-so did the other night at my house that, you know, made me feel like this big when I'm the cook. 

Recording: (1076/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1077/ 9621) 
 It's like, oh. 

Recording: (1078/ 9621) 
 If you're going to do something like that you better at least know the risks involved into it and what exactly you're doing before you do anything like that. 

Recording: (1079/ 9621) 
 because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars. So. 

Recording: (1080/ 9621) 
 So we had a lot of time together and she said she thinks that was worth it. 

Recording: (1081/ 9621) 
 This is my family, I can do what I want with it. shocked and they're the ones that are going to be panicked when everything, you know, because it's getting smaller, the world's getting smaller, we're more populated now than we ever have been. So people need to learn to work together and to be together. 

Recording: (1082/ 9621) 
 Because I wasn't allowed to wear jeans. I wasn't allowed to wear tennis shoes. 

Recording: (1083/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1084/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (1085/ 9621) 
 Oh, so that's... 

Recording: (1086/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1087/ 9621) 
 And then the powers that be in the American Army decided, well, we'll go up to this little area of—oh, I was there four months—NCO. 

Recording: (1088/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1089/ 9621) 
 San Diego is probably why. Yeah, I've heard that's a nice place. 

Recording: (1090/ 9621) 
 We went to the zoo. We go to the playground. Take my dog to the playground. We'll go shopping. Grocery shopping. 

Recording: (1091/ 9621) 
 So hey. 

Recording: (1092/ 9621) 
 What are your biggest worries in your role? somebody decides who should have kids and who's not, but I don't think God's gonna come down and do that, so, you know what I mean? We can't really decide that. But to be honest, I'm for it. It doesn't have to be, well, I'm not even sure, tube-stiders is pretty permanent. But even if they could do something like on a yearly basis and give them $200 a year, that's still not, it's still much cheaper than them having kids. And then if they, I'd give more money if they'd clean up their act, just for them. As far as it being racist, I don't think, I think they're missing the point, because I'm sure there's some runaway white teenage girls out there too, or Mexican or whatnot. 

Recording: (1093/ 9621) 
 I got him sounds like I bought a dog. 

Recording: (1094/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we lived, we moved about five or six years ago. And the house we had before was some big like 80, 90 year old house. 

Recording: (1095/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I got a son, he's a senior at Audubon. 

Recording: (1096/ 9621) 
 I was reading a thing though in USA, I think it was yesterday, where your minority and your majority, you know, it's always been that. They were trying to make it seem like it's different. It's always, like the Army, it's always been 40% minority and 60% or something like that. You know, the Air Force has always been like 70-30 or something like that, you know, because the standards are a little bit higher to get in. A lot of people don't want to get into that. You know, they don't want to take them to test and everything, you know. My cousin that was a, spent 25 years, I think, in the Army, because that's, he could have done better, but that's all he wanted to do, you know, be a drill sergeant and stuff like that, you know. But I just think a lot of times the media, 

Recording: (1097/ 9621) 
 You know, so it's, you know, if you have a problem, if you want to talk to somebody, well, if somebody you know personally doesn't, they know somebody. 

Recording: (1098/ 9621) 
 You know, not that what you wear makes you, but he just, he's a good role model. 

Recording: (1099/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (1100/ 9621) 
 Well, I thought about that, doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant. 

Recording: (1101/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1102/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. And then when I got my master's, no, I did it during the weekends and the summers and the nights. And it took me about, well, I started teaching in 1970, or 71. 

Recording: (1103/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1104/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1105/ 9621) 
 Yeah. I guess I'm just so secure about who I am that I don't have a problem with it. And I was in the men's glee club for a while, so there's a small percentage of the people in there that are gay as well. And I really made friends with a lot of them. I guess it's just because of my personality. I really don't know what it is, but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says, come, hey, you can be my friend, I'm cool, I'm all right, even though I'm not one of you, I can still be your friend, which is sort of what I try and emanate because I'm very, very religious, and the Christian community is very, is, I'm not gonna say can be, I say they are. The Christian community is very, very mean towards homosexuals. And that's just not right. I mean, they're people. They're making a mistake in my eyes, yes, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna look at them any differently as human beings. They deserve my respect. Oh yeah, but I see everyone as engaging in sinful behavior because in my religion everyone sins. I'm a Christian, I go to a non-denominational church. I don't like denominations. 

Recording: (1106/ 9621) 
 It's a lot easier to market yourself. 

Recording: (1107/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1108/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he and three other people, well a lot of them had signed the union. They have to have almost everybody sign for it. But he was one of the people that had really been, yes. And so he fired him, but not for that, because you can't do that. It's illegal. But he sent a form letter with everybody. It was exactly the same to the three people that were fired except for their names were changed for the, these like basically made up reasons. 

Recording: (1109/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I have two other sisters. One of them is, well, it's funny because we're all divorced. Out of the five of us, we're all on, one of them is on her third marriage and we're all on our second. Except for one, she's divorced and she hasn't remarried. And then my oldest, I told you in Akron, I guess she's not remarried. 

Recording: (1110/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1111/ 9621) 
 She's the type of person I love to annoy. 

Recording: (1112/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1113/ 9621) 
 But she's yelling at everybody's prejudice against her. And I got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work. 

Recording: (1114/ 9621) 
 No, that's not what I mean. I don't mean it that way, but I think it's better that if people get to a point where they can't work it out. I think that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things, and maybe there is some way to work it out. 

Recording: (1115/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (1116/ 9621) 
 You'd be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks. 

Recording: (1117/ 9621) 
 I don't understand that. 

Recording: (1118/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1119/ 9621) 
 Essentially all the big academics, most of the US, it's actually all over the world, it's international. 

Recording: (1120/ 9621) 
 uh... lunch she was there for pregnancy but she did and i'm just going to public school 

Recording: (1121/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, mm-hmm. It's the biggest thing. 

Recording: (1122/ 9621) 
 I've seen the big amphitheater and what's that, what is that? The opera house, yeah, right on the, right on the, what is it, the ocean or whatever. It's gorgeous. 

Recording: (1123/ 9621) 
 I'd say it's not any different than having a man. I mean, it's a person. She'd just have a different way of going about it, probably. 

Recording: (1124/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I had the prerogative. I could have gone somewhere else and made more money. But the bad part was, as the university's trying to do away with civil service. Civil service is a good thing and a bad thing. You had step raises and everything, so at least you did have an increase back then. Nowadays, you have nothing. 

Recording: (1125/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's it. 

Recording: (1126/ 9621) 
 Well, I was pretty well established about responsibility and that sort of thing before I went into service. I was the oldest son in a family of ten. 

Recording: (1127/ 9621) 
 without going into too much detail, one of my best friends from high school, well, he stayed at home and I went off to Columbus and I found an amazing church down here and learned a lot and really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine and theological beliefs and I believe that stuff now and he doesn't and he feels actually strongly that anyone who believes that is like a heretic He just went off to Alaska with another friend of ours, and before he left for Alaska, I actually took the time to, I didn't want to, but he was sort of pushing me into it, because we were IMing each other, and he sort of pushed me into it a little bit, and I told him, I'm like, a lot of the stuff that you have talked about, you know, talked about not liking, I believe. And I told him, I said, I can understand if in our minds there's a problem, but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that. But that's not what you're thinking. You're thinking, you're looking at me and you're knowing within your mind, he's evil, he's wrong. And I said, that's not right, dude. I honestly don't know. People get really scared. There's certain, I mean like, there's certain denominations that will take one, it's sort of like the outer limits. They'll take one book or one scripture out of the Bible and expand it to crystal clarity. And they'll just run with it. And that's what my mom came out of. Her denomination that she came out of, she's not part of it anymore, the denomination she came out of it, some of the more devout churches within the apostolic Christian church were talking men sit on one side, women sit on the other, women wear little thingies on their heads, no jewelry. The sermon is read in three different languages. Some really wacky stuff. 

Recording: (1128/ 9621) 
 You know, the only thing that really, really saved my son, I think, from getting in any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports. 

Recording: (1129/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1130/ 9621) 
 No, no, but he has a daughter and that was from high school. His girlfriend got pregnant and then he stayed with her and they tried to work things out and they never got married and that was when he lived in Canada. So she lives in Canada now and he goes, he talks to her all the time and then they're real open about that. I mean, she's real good about letting the little girl come and she'll stay the summer with us and he'll drive up there and see her too. 

Recording: (1131/ 9621) 
 I got told I can be an idiot. 

Recording: (1132/ 9621) 
 So you pretty much have to be, you know, you can't be middle class in New York. You have to be rich or you're not. 

Recording: (1133/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1134/ 9621) 
 No. No, She-Ra. 

Recording: (1135/ 9621) 
 No, he didn't. He didn't. 

Recording: (1136/ 9621) 
 unless you get stuck in traffic. 

Recording: (1137/ 9621) 
 Nobody. Oh, she is really plain smart. I mean... 

Recording: (1138/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think they could have, I thought you got a better education out there. Now at St. Louis, cool public school district, you probably would have had the same as here, but by being Kirkwood, you know, relatively small and everything. I think we maybe had 100 and something kids in our graduating class, you know, so I felt I got better attention when I wanted it, you know, than I would have had at a bigger school. 

Recording: (1139/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, getting a gun doesn't seem- I mean, I was surprised, like, I would- I've never owned a gun, but I'm- I think it's pretty easy to get one, actually. 

Recording: (1140/ 9621) 
 I think it's really, you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on and how long they stay on it. And most kids don't like being on medication because it makes them different. They don't look at it like, gee, I'm really lucky I live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate. They look at it like, well, my friends have to do it, so why do I have to do it? You know? They look at it like it's a big pain because they've got to run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch. And generally, the long acting, the time released ones, there's only a couple of them, a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release. And they only work for about 40% of the population. Most people try the time release and it wears off and it doesn't do what it's supposed to do so they go back to the six hour dosage, you know, one in the morning, one at lunch. And then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they're late to the lunch line and, you know, they just hate it. So, but it isn't something they can, a lot of kids will not, I guess they're in denial just like we would be. They say, well it doesn't help me, I don't need it. But when you sit down and say, okay, what are the things you're able to do when you're on it that you really have trouble with when you're off of it? And they see it in black and white, they go, oh yeah. 

Recording: (1141/ 9621) 
 I think so, yeah, like the haircuts are a certain way and you have to shave and you always have to have your tie and your jacket if you can, unless it's really hot. It's different also depending on the climate. 

Recording: (1142/ 9621) 
 And it's true. So that's the most powerful thing I can do. When I can turn it over to God and say, God, this is too damn big for me to handle. Do you think you can work on maybe helping change this person's heart or their mind? Because I can't do that. So I didn't mean to get off on a tangent there. 

Recording: (1143/ 9621) 
 When I did school levy campaigns and a couple of other campaigns, to me the biggest thing is what the campaign does on election day called get out the vote. That's the most important thing that can be done. I used to always at the beginning of a campaign for a school levy get a list of all the registered voters and of course I had a very limited population in a school district and I would would have the school district compare it to parents. And the first thing I do is register parents because many of them don't vote. And I read a study somewhere that the average person in this country doesn't even begin to vote until they're 40. If I had known that when I was in college and worked so hard to get the vote changed to 18, because I couldn't vote until I was 21, and I was upset, you know, because I wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the Vietnam War. That was a big issue, and I couldn't. I had to wait until I was 21, so there were a bunch of us at college that, you know, worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed. If I'd known that they weren't going to vote at 18 and were going to wait until they were almost 40, I wouldn't have wasted my time. But anyway, you get parents who are usually younger, especially of the first, second, third grade age, 

Recording: (1144/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1145/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1146/ 9621) 
 And then it's different businesses like White Castle or pizza, one of the pizza places and some of the supermarkets and things and they're advertised you know throughout the community. So these kids when they have problems they might want to go to Huckleberry House and they don't have a way so they go to a safe house and they call and they have a group of volunteers to go out and pick these kids up, take them to Huckleberry House, which isn't far from here. So I did that for a while but it wasn't very satisfying because I really didn't feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids at Huckleberry House. 

Recording: (1147/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1148/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1149/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1150/ 9621) 
 Well, I'm saying on the whole world. And everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do, even me. I think that maybe he's found it the same way, but maybe not as much as I have. I thought when I retired, I was going to get this done and this done and this done. And I wonder now how I went to work and still got so many things done when I got home. And I'm sure I'm doing it just as fast because over and over again, people say, I've never seen anybody with as much energy. You're always doing something. And I think it's just that we don't have the time. 

Recording: (1151/ 9621) 
 Oh, sure. 

Recording: (1152/ 9621) 
 Right, so they don't come see me and I guess I shouldn't care because I would just like them, actually I'd like them to just come for about 20 minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have. That's all I care about, I just want to show it off. 

Recording: (1153/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's a lot smaller than Columbus though 

Recording: (1154/ 9621) 
 And I think there was an article this last Wednesday in the dispatch and business section as to how the PUCO can't regulate it and because of that they want to deregulate telecommunications. And so for the past months we haven't been getting telephone bills for usage. We have the backbone we're paying for. And what's going to happen out of this whole thing is it offers us a lot of latitude where we can now, if we have a contractor, let's say over in Dayton, and we're calling from Zanesville office, I'd rather make a long distance, we can go on our pipe, and if we have a line going over Dayton, we can make the call as if it's a local call, avoiding all long distance. 

Recording: (1155/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1156/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1157/ 9621) 
 Do you have one now? 

Recording: (1158/ 9621) 
 We can balance the brother out a little bit. 

Recording: (1159/ 9621) 
 I don't really think there's any huge difference. I can say from what I've seen the people that went to the Catholic schools they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that. Like I mean most of my friends have gone to the public schools are really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here. 

Recording: (1160/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, I guess so. I mean, I always spent the weekends with my dad, and I spent the week with him. 

Recording: (1161/ 9621) 
 Like because there's not like like a like it's fine leads lead person because just one person doing a mostly in most of time I mean like people do have groups that play like techno beat or in music But it's not like a lead singer who like you know, it's like that. It's not like that at all 

Recording: (1162/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1163/ 9621) 
 It's extremely difficult to deal with. 

Recording: (1164/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1165/ 9621) 
 We've probably been five, six times already. 

Recording: (1166/ 9621) 
 talk to him like you know this be nice down 

Recording: (1167/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1168/ 9621) 
 Um, not really. I mean, I've been with a few people that have just, I mean, just randomly gotten kind of jumped. I mean, they didn't steal anything. They just beat them up for no reason or whatnot. 

Recording: (1169/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I was cutting 20 pounds in three days. 

Recording: (1170/ 9621) 
 white women who had actually had it done than Hispanic or African American. But I don't know. At least in that case, I mean, before we were talking about the government, I mean, at least in that case, there still is a choice. I mean, there's money involved, but it's not so much money that it would radically change your life in a sort of, you know, it's not thousands of dollars. It was 200, I believe. And that's, you know, I mean, if that amount of money is going to sway you in that direction? I don't know. I think there is the debate about 10 years down the line, but is there going to be something that's going to make them change? What is it going to be and how realistic is it for what percentage. I don't know anything about the sort of statistics of people who do clean up their act or anything like that. I do think if there is that element of choice, it's a lot different than the government saying, okay, this is your cutoff limit. But I mean, the statistics they were giving on the average number of children that these women were having and the average number of children that were just taken to the hospital and left there or just dropped off wherever and the state that these children were in and their lifespan and everything else. I mean, there's the human rights for the mother, but what about the human rights for the child's life? I mean, I think all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases. And the same is in England. Everyone's saying, oh, because they were talking about, I mean, again, this was was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of, you know, somehow sort of forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control, you know, in whatever way and again that everyone was up in arms but it's sort of like, you know, what is that child's quality of life going to be when their mother's just, you know, 

Recording: (1171/ 9621) 
 It took us 10 years to have the baby. I think my mom genuinely thought I was doing birth control, and we weren't, but you always knew the sub-autotone, endotones, you know. Is she or isn't she? I was just like, well, I'm not going to discuss it with her because I knew that was a no-no to her, but I wasn't, but she didn't need to know that. 

Recording: (1172/ 9621) 
 and too much prejudice. There really is still and it's sad, but there really is. 

Recording: (1173/ 9621) 
 Because now they're getting to the age where they're fighting more and you got a boy and a girl. 

Recording: (1174/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (1175/ 9621) 
 and what they would say about Americans and American culture at that discussion group in front of you. 

Recording: (1176/ 9621) 
 One thing, okay, go ahead. Well, one thing I was thinking that I have a perspective on that maybe lots of people don't is how Columbus has grown up. 

Recording: (1177/ 9621) 
 thing. 

Recording: (1178/ 9621) 
 So, and I figured, I have 100, up to 154 credits. And so, I'm up to like 94 right now, and I figured that'd be a decent, I mean it translates over, because we're in semesters. It'll get all messed up there, but it's like, I'm halfway to three-fourths done with my degree, so if I wanted to transfer now, it'd be like, because after this point, if I stay any longer, a lot of the credits won't transfer over. It would be a waste of time, because most places don't like to take more than half. So, that's why I just figured right now I should look. 

Recording: (1179/ 9621) 
 I mean, just like Beauty and the Beast, there's extreme amount of violence in there. You know, just every one, there's a bad, dark side in the story. So children just start, and I mean, it's in there. And then, including my own daughter, she, and I swear I had her watch Mr. Rogers all the time. But now that she's older, she watches TV. She's addicted to TV, something terrible. And so, of course, her children are. But I think, you know, I didn't have TV when I was a child child. And I think, you know, it stimulates the imagination in some ways but I don't know what direction that imagination really goes, you know. But there's a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody's face anymore. As a matter of fact, I'm getting so I don't watch the news anymore. 

Recording: (1180/ 9621) 
 Henderson, Oluwantangi. 

Recording: (1181/ 9621) 
 So National Merit Scholars also get full in-state tuition. 

Recording: (1182/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (1183/ 9621) 
 I don't under, I mean, it was my money, so why should it matter? 

Recording: (1184/ 9621) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (1185/ 9621) 
 just people coming from High Street and just happen to be centralized right there on 12th Avenue. 

Recording: (1186/ 9621) 
 I can check my account, see how much money I got and they'll actually list things that I've bought, you know, like how many, your existing account and all that, what you've bought, check clearing, so you can see if checks cleared. 

Recording: (1187/ 9621) 
 Well, I think we, oh yeah, we're church goers, but just be going church goers isn't being faithful. I think it's just sharing yourself with one another in daily lives, listening to someone, outreaching to someone, whatever it might be. That's the ministry that I think our Lord has given us. 

Recording: (1188/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1189/ 9621) 
 So I don't know whether they did any damage or not. 

Recording: (1190/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1191/ 9621) 
 It really is. 

Recording: (1192/ 9621) 
 Yeah, the police said that they've been there many times. 

Recording: (1193/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (1194/ 9621) 
 Did you? 

Recording: (1195/ 9621) 
 It's like an advertisement for it. 

Recording: (1196/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah. 

Recording: (1197/ 9621) 
 $21 million check to hit the doorstep, you know. 

Recording: (1198/ 9621) 
 So, but that's, you know, I ended up settling the attorney, got most of the money. What little I had, I invested some, and then I made some bad investments when I went off my medication, and, you know, blew it. You know, so that was my responsibility, my fault, but, you know, how it was just years of penn up frustration. And I just, I spent it, I spent it in a, you know, unorthodox way, but, you know, I had fun doing it. 

Recording: (1199/ 9621) 
 of at the same time every day. 

Recording: (1200/ 9621) 
 She goes, well yeah, Dad, they cost money. I said, oh, Lord. 

Recording: (1201/ 9621) 
 I hope so, yeah. 

Recording: (1202/ 9621) 
 They wouldn't know. I went to two different doctors and they said you possibly will change your mind. And you know I was single. Maybe if I would have been married they might have considered it. But they said no way would they do it. And we're talking 15 years ago. 

Recording: (1203/ 9621) 
 But the company wanted him to move to Florida and he didn't want to move. 

Recording: (1204/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1205/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (1206/ 9621) 
 Brugge 

Recording: (1207/ 9621) 
 I'd probably vote for Bush over Clinton. 

Recording: (1208/ 9621) 
 So I hesitate to say that it would really help them. It would just be better if somebody could keep their eyes open, or if we had more counselors or things like that to deal with everything, including that. 

Recording: (1209/ 9621) 
 Is this weird? 

Recording: (1210/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but the ones that they really needed to do like to set one like 71 and 70 I mean that that's a bottleneck area, you know, and they really should have done some of that 20 years ago, you know 

Recording: (1211/ 9621) 
 And when was your first chance to return back to work? he was very independent but I'm not sure that that's just his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being put and being in daycare from a very very young age and and then you know my youngest he's never been in daycare at all 

Recording: (1212/ 9621) 
 That's still enough for me. 

Recording: (1213/ 9621) 
 What? 

Recording: (1214/ 9621) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (1215/ 9621) 
 Yes. But there's nobody at home but my sister and I, so domestic violence would have been a curious affair. So I just figured something weird's going on. I didn't know what was going on, but at the same time, it was all divorce related and just basically dumb. Cause the divorce wasn't going to phase me because the entire marriage was, we knew, we knew from the beginning that it was a dumb idea and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable. So we're just kind of waiting around going, I'm going to be divorced for a couple of months. And sure enough months and sure enough so anyway So I look at these people and their names are the Coming forward with two police officers behind them and mr. It's kind of a large gentleman And he's way too somber for the experience and if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce I'm going to give you some sort of shit for it and at the same time Mrs. Used to be a principal of mine in elementary school 

Recording: (1216/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1217/ 9621) 
 It's, they're always synonymous, but. 

Recording: (1218/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (1219/ 9621) 
 I do somewhat, just not a, one of them I just got back from lunch with, I mean I see him 

Recording: (1220/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1221/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1222/ 9621) 
 I think there's been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that. And I really think, even though I would hope there was a better way to handle it, I think they did the right thing by taking him away from the cousins. I mean, the cousins have been stressing all along, he needs family, he needs, well, there's a much closer family than your father. And they love this country and this stuff. Well, then accept the laws and and follow them whether you agree with them or not. I think I it was very unfortunate the way it happened but I think the government should not allow to let it go on as long as they had. 

Recording: (1223/ 9621) 
 So is that? So what is the industry? Is there one main industry? Did a lot of that leave in fact, it's a lot more low-key. It's more of an agricultural county. Ashland City is right where I live. We're like five minutes outside of Ashland City. But Ashland City is the county seat for Ashland County. And Mansfield is the county seat for Richland County. Yeah, but everybody does everything in Mansfield because there's nothing to do in Ashland. The Mansfield branch campus for OSU is there. So what was it like growing up in a small town? It was really boring. It was really boring. My dad was just getting himself settled into the community and with his job and everything. My mom stayed home, so she stayed with us for a while. Most of my early childhood memories are from where we lived in Mansfield. It was a real don't talk, don't ask community. I mean, you really didn't know your neighbors unless you went over and said hi. They never came over. Yeah. So... It was a mostly sort of suburban kind of set up. Yeah. Yeah. We lived in the suburban area of Mansfield. Sort of like the white collar area where all the people who were businessmen were getting themselves established. So and then we switched churches and also my dad opened up, he and his partner opened up another branch office in Ashland. So we moved to the Ashland area about about eight years ago, almost nine years ago. And we moved to Ashland to get halfway between So it must be out in the sense that we've got a barn, we've got tractors, we lease some of the land out to a farmer who actually works it and plants stuff. No, not to be on a farm, no. My dad's a doctor. 

Recording: (1224/ 9621) 
 Well, it's competition to be earliest and the federal government is trying to stay out of the state's face. So again, it's another one of those things that just live with it. There's enough things to do and fight in life that that's not worth it. 

Recording: (1225/ 9621) 
 But no, see, and I would have never, you know, you don't know until you get a reaction like that. 

Recording: (1226/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's just so funny, you know. I know we talk too long, but this is so much fun. 

Recording: (1227/ 9621) 
 Like they have this, they have like two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens. And like, could you imagine like? 

Recording: (1228/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1229/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1230/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1231/ 9621) 
 Yeah, half tank gas. 

Recording: (1232/ 9621) 
 That's when you take him to grandma. Yeah. That's what we do. He's got to go. Grandma night, because we live with my mom and dad, so he gets to see my side all the time. He doesn't get to see them as much, so it's like when that night comes on, go to grandma. Or like we take him to her like movies and when we want to go see a movie and because his mom gets those free tickets 

Recording: (1233/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1234/ 9621) 
 do Kwanzaa, do Hanukkah, so that they can learn the other cultures and the other values. But they just don't do any of them. 

Recording: (1235/ 9621) 
 No, because I think there's the ideal in everything. And if you can't live up to that ideal standard, but you do the best you can do. And I think that's where I was coming from. I mean, even now, I mean, I could never agree with abortion, let's say. I would stand by the church. And most of the church laws I do stand by. But I guess the birth control issue became so personal and it was just a decision that had to be made and I had to make it with what I felt was a clear conscience in what I did. I don't have any regrets for it. What about you? 

Recording: (1236/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1237/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, it's I'll just give you a rough estimate of two and a half miles from here 

Recording: (1238/ 9621) 
 Well, it's not that there's been too much growth. I mean, growth is good, but now they need to stop. 

Recording: (1239/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1240/ 9621) 
 Hate crime is an interesting term. All crimes, all murders are hate related. I'm not sure. It's difficult. We had civil rights laws. Many people were opposed to those, but it was in an effort to correct years of institutionalized racism. And maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate. But a crime is a crime. Are you going to give someone who murdered Matthew Shepard six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term. I mean, murder is murder. And there's already a law on the books. I don't think we need to have a hate crime over and above that. The people who murdered Matthew Shepard should be tried and hopefully convicted on the facts and shouldn't have anything else added into it. I think doing that is going to do the same thing that many of the civil rights and the affirmative action programs and the busing did to people. It's going to turn people against gays, like it turned people against blacks for a while, although ultimately I think it did make a difference. I have a black friend at the Ohio Education Association who was very active in the 60s in opening up restaurants in the South and marching and opening the schools in the South. I said to her one day, are you disappointed that things aren't better, that people still hate blacks? This was 10, 15 years ago. She said no, she said that wasn't my goal. My goal wasn't to change hearts and minds. My goal was to change behavior, and the behavior changed. Except now, I never thought I would live to see an all-white jury convict white men of killing a black man. We're in hearts and minds now. 

Recording: (1241/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's... 

Recording: (1242/ 9621) 
 And I suggest the shot, the Depo-Provero, because that's what I'm on now. And that way you don't miss any pills that last for three months, you know. And that's what I would suggest for her, you know. 

Recording: (1243/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (1244/ 9621) 
 I mean, if we were that racist of a city, then we wouldn't be that accepting to gay pride marches and the blackout that we had on campus a few weeks back. 

Recording: (1245/ 9621) 
 We had the time. 

Recording: (1246/ 9621) 
 I do know a few people that are gay, but they're in their 30s. 

Recording: (1247/ 9621) 
 Cross-dressing. Not cross-dressing. When two men live together and two women live together, what do you call it? Homosexual. Gays. Oh, okay. Is that the same thing? 

Recording: (1248/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, I didn't have back problems or anything like that, but it was just like the feeling, it was like I'm not right. 

Recording: (1249/ 9621) 
 It's so funny. That's what my daughter's idea. We're going down. We're always looking to say, hmm, there could do the yeah. And plus, 

Recording: (1250/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1251/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he's not getting that. I don't think he's getting that learning. That's his grandmother, you know, watching him. And I wish that she would do more of the learning things that the daycares do do. 

Recording: (1252/ 9621) 
 It was part of the time. 

Recording: (1253/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1254/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there was just something about that sting far better, far more than the paddle. Paddle was've grown older, I've found it's worse in today's world. As I said, it has the civil rights movement, and you have a right to this, and you have a right to that. It's terrible. Murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain. That plea bargain, I think, is the most thing that ever was passed. Appeals appeals 

Recording: (1255/ 9621) 
 Right, right, but that helped me just getting away, getting my mind cleared, doing a little bit of reading, going, wait a minute, you know, it's so obvious, hello, but oh yeah. 

Recording: (1256/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1257/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1258/ 9621) 
 Haha, uh-huh. 

Recording: (1259/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I was driving by the honking and everything. So yeah, my roommates and I got into a debate about it, but we didn't really resolve it. 

Recording: (1260/ 9621) 
 And even if you had two full bloods from two different tribes and they had a child, the federal government still considered some half-blood. 

Recording: (1261/ 9621) 
 Yes? 

Recording: (1262/ 9621) 
 Um, actually I was over there when all of that happened, but of course it was all over the papers. And, you know, I think, I mean, I, I don't know what it was like really here. I can imagine, but I mean, there, especially they really focused on, um, not Columbine, but the one with the, the younger kids in Arkansas was a day before I was there for both of those. But, you know, in the first one, you know, they, they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear holding the gun everywhere, and Columbine, every paper had a slightly different slant on the story, and the facts were all over the place, but that's another kind of issue, but what I think caused it, I mean, I don't know, I think that more should have been made of the fact of this terrible sort of resentment for the other students, and I'm not in any way defending the guys who did it, but something is wrong, not only with them, but in the fact that they were driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever that you would even think of doing something like that. I don't know, especially with everything that was said about the families, and they didn't seem to, of course you never really know, but they didn't seem to have grown up in this terrible environment and have that sort of preconditioned or anything like that. Yeah, I think a lot more effort needs to be made to sort of placate those sort of situations. And I mean who does it is sort of another question because the teachers already are overworked and underpaid and all those kind of things. But I don't know. 

Recording: (1263/ 9621) 
 Okay! 

Recording: (1264/ 9621) 
 the game. 

Recording: (1265/ 9621) 
 88. So we just had our 11th wedding anniversary. Yeah. 

Recording: (1266/ 9621) 
 is 

Recording: (1267/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1268/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think they're really helpful and I think that it's the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it. There's really, but there's so much fraud and there's so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it. You know, like with me, I didn't want to stay on that. I wanted to be on my own and I was perfectly capable of it. But if I didn't have the ambition that I had, I might've stayed home. There's like nine, you know, there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that I would get up and go to work every day and she would have food delivered to her front step and she drove that year's car. I mean she had a brand new, like whatever year it was, that's the car she had and I would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and I thought 

Recording: (1269/ 9621) 
 Yeah, oh yeah, you know people I was in kindergarten with I graduated with so. It's kind of like the small town thing which have its goods and bads but I don't know. Yeah my parents still live there and I still associate with a lot of friends I graduated with that still live in town and you know they just had a 20-year reunion here a couple years ago and a lot of participation in that and so. 

Recording: (1270/ 9621) 
 You can't take that away from me. Like you said, I think they just go through a lot of stuff. I mean, I had a lot of animosity towards my dad for things that happened. Perhaps not being there when I was younger and stuff like that. If anything, me and my brother got close because he know, cuz he's three years older than me and then But but you know now You know, I don't have they're both but my parents have passed away, but you know, I don't have any animosity towards him at all I can't like it's kind of like a growing up thing. I guess you know, I mean you you Kind of sit there and say hey, you know, he did the best he could you know, I mean I 

Recording: (1271/ 9621) 
 is often so similar to where I'm coming from. 

Recording: (1272/ 9621) 
 It's a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted 25 feet in the air against the pine tree found out. In my opinion, when that stuff happens, when I see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in Spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out and the bull runs his gourd through the person's leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death, I don't have any sympathy for him. 

Recording: (1273/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1274/ 9621) 
 He'd be lost. 

Recording: (1275/ 9621) 
 We can get to the beach and take them there. We have family in Florida. We have family in Hawaii. We have family in Virginia Beach. 

Recording: (1276/ 9621) 
 Because I went to Oregon and of course the greater part of the population out there are more socialists than they are capitalists. And they're easier to deal with and they're more reasonable people in my opinion, much more reasonable. But then I come back to Columbus and all my family and all, I'm the minority in my family, believe me. And they're very into capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them. 

Recording: (1277/ 9621) 
 Does that mean? 

Recording: (1278/ 9621) 
 And then a couple years later, he was working on a job in the Columbus Coated Fabrics plant, which is a plant that makes coated fabrics. The main thing is auto upholstery, car upholstery. Anyway, they had big rolling machines that rolled this stuff out, and their fumes came off of it. So they had a big hood and exhaust system 

Recording: (1279/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I don't know if it was drugs or something ridiculous that a lot of people and I think a lot of the police force and a lot of other officials are pretty much in agreement that he should resign and he feels like he's just not going to and that we don't have any, the mayor can't, nobody can actually make him resign, that that's something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as, you know, Dorothy Teeter was saying, I'm going to make him do this, which is something that she doesn't have any power to do. And about how they just continue to get raises and they're not doing very much about it. And less than 50% of the police force is actually in police cars, and a lot of people are doing desk jobs and those types of things. And I guess a lot of people just aren't very happy with the job he's been doing. 

Recording: (1280/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1281/ 9621) 
 Well, in the ambiguous part of it, you know, just saying, trying to be protective of the ways. 

Recording: (1282/ 9621) 
 right 

Recording: (1283/ 9621) 
 because of the gay activism. 

Recording: (1284/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1285/ 9621) 
 He moved to Texas because like he was moving into like he was going to SMU there and like so I moved back from Florida back to up up here cuz I didn't want I don't want to go with him to Texas Texas Texas terrible and like um so then like my mom was like my parents got divorced when I was like five or something and so 

Recording: (1286/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1287/ 9621) 
 since March too. 

Recording: (1288/ 9621) 
 It is a couple miles

 She's funny because she's gained 26 pounds and she doesn't look pregnant. She had on a regular sweater today.

 Right now, but I knew him when he was eight ten months sober. I work every day 

Recording: (1292/ 9621) 
 I've never heard it said before, like you said, that the reason women aren't preached is because they don't show any kind of spiritual leadership. I've never heard that said. And there must be people who think that. 

Recording: (1293/ 9621) 
 But that's my plan. 

Recording: (1294/ 9621) 
 But they just don't have those. 

Recording: (1295/ 9621) 
 you know, a historic building, they're like, there's no history in America, you know? 

Recording: (1296/ 9621) 
 Redden. I don't know why that was, but it sounds like it, I guess. And yeah, I was called a lot of little things.

Recording: (1298/ 9621) 
 I'm talking to the TV. 

Recording: (1299/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like I knew Like a lot of people who lived on campus. I used to live down on Hudson like over the summer before I went to OSU So, I mean I like campus and everything it's just like oh she was different than campus, yeah 

Recording: (1300/ 9621) 
 But if you love someone, you want them to do what's right and you want them to learn. And if that's the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong, you still love them, but you're loving other people also. In other words, you're not letting the fact, this is my child, so he can get away with murder, but this one over here, I'm not going to let him get away with it. No, I'm sorry. If my child committed something that this other one would have had to pay for, I'm sorry you've done that, dear, and I love you dearly. But I tried to teach you differently. I don't know where you went wrong. I don't know what I did wrong, whatever. But you got to pay for I'm sorry you've done that dear but and I love you dearly but I try to teach you different out where you went wrong I don't want to do wrong whatever but you got to pay the penalty I Mean you have to draw the line somewhere But now you said family yes, I think the reason that at our age we look back Everyone was born and everyone was loved by a father my rail when they were little and how their formative years are and the education the The way they were taught as they were growing up Does help them to become what that president is what that polity any politician is any minister or anybody else? It the way you are raised I firmly believe and the things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life. And I know a lot of the things that I've done in my life are definitely based on what I saw happen back here. You know? And I think that it bears on everybody. So that's why it really begins with the family. 

Recording: (1301/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, it's just sort of like the whole reputation of America just being like the country of excess, like excess possessions, excess food, excess weight, excess money, you know, everything, you know, and it's, you know, I sort of have mixed feelings about it. The first time when I was gone for about a year and a half and I came back and, you know, this is, I had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere, especially of mainland Europe and everything. And I come back and where my parents live, there were all these new strip malls built and stuff, and I just felt like I was in this giant Kmart land. It just was so overwhelming, even though obviously I had grown with in America my whole life and you know not that I sort of changed completely but you do when you've been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like cavernous places and like just the other day my friend took me to Easton and I mean you walk in there and I don't feel like I'm in Columbus you know I feel like it's got to be California or something just because it just 

Recording: (1302/ 9621) 
 help. 

Recording: (1303/ 9621) 
 No. And she said, you know, and the last three or four years she just wrote it out so she could retire. And she used to be a very dedicated, very dedicated teacher. And she just, it was a job then. And I hate to see that happen to good teachers. 

Recording: (1304/ 9621) 
 If you don't make a child support payment, they should do the same thing. I don't know why they don't have a system like that. 

Recording: (1305/ 9621) 
 so the state would pay for it. 

Recording: (1306/ 9621) 
 Um, when I went, I went with my friend. 

Recording: (1307/ 9621) 
 And she said she'd get back to me on it. Well, I've never heard nothing from her. And she's done that to me I don't know how many times. 

Recording: (1308/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (1309/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, that's beautiful. 

Recording: (1310/ 9621) 
 I think they would have a bigger problem with it, yeah. 

Recording: (1311/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (1312/ 9621) 
 but most of the time i try it out like most of the time it's pretty easy it's pretty straight forward sometimes it's really aggravating when 

Recording: (1313/ 9621) 
 That's not true. I mean some of the older men and older tribes and different tribes 

Recording: (1314/ 9621) 
 I go to Northland High School right now. 

Recording: (1315/ 9621) 
 I don't go to city center too much although I like it being there if I want to go to it. 

Recording: (1316/ 9621) 
 No because I have a stigmatism. You know the glass is cut in right here. That's irritating. 

Recording: (1317/ 9621) 
 No, my mom's, she's not an invalid. She's 72 years old, but they go out usually to yard sales and stuff like that, stuff I don't wanna do. 

Recording: (1318/ 9621) 
 Yes, you're right. 

Recording: (1319/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1320/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1321/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, and I'll probably step on your toes here, but I'm not a firm believer of mom and dad both working. My wife worked until we had children, then she stayed home. And once they got into school, she worked at a school. So when they were gone, she was gone. When they were home, she was home. And my parents didn't do that, and I hated it. I hated coming home from school by myself every day. There was nobody there to talk to, and I did it for years. And I just feel that, you know, I hope you don't have children yet, do you? Good. Because to me, parents who put kids in daycare and after school programs are like people who have cats and dogs. I get up in the morning and I feed my pet, my child, then I put him in the kennel. And I go to work and I go, gee, I'd like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie. We'll just put her in another kennel after work. And we take her from one kennel to the other kennel. We go, we'll be back in a little bit. And then I go and I have all my fun and I go pick her up at the kennel and I bring her home and I dust her off. 

Recording: (1322/ 9621) 
 So be it. We had the ribbiters out there helping out the GIs. Fine. Team effort, wasn't it? But then after GIs came home, the little lady went back into the house. And business saw these idle lines and said, hey, we can do something here. Because in those days, little ladies said, well, I'll go out and do a little odd job. We want a little thing. Mom will pick up a little extra things here and so forth. Dad was a primarywinner But she'd gone to some odd jobs just to complement their needs for that budget They bought things on a cash basis as they needed it They did not go out and spend on credit. I'm gonna hit myself here, but Business said hey, let's produce these lines Little lady you are a free trader We can make it for you, and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass-produce it 

Recording: (1323/ 9621) 
 Yeah. From what I hear, actually, like the Emory and the University of Chicago, you have to work really hard because they get all the kids who wish they would have gotten to Harvard and then start, you know, try to make it up by working harder. You get to actual Harvard, nobody works because they're like, we already made it, you know. 

Recording: (1324/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and we're one of them. Texas is supporting strong. They have like 

Recording: (1325/ 9621) 
 I've come home get in the car go go somewhere, you know, or come on get something to eat But I Think that has a lot to do with it I don't really know that TV has that much because I remember coming home as a kid and watching Howdy Doody and all that stuff and of course it wasn't the Violent stuff. Maybe you can see on TV now, but I don't really think the media has had that much to do with it. It's just a different time now. I mean, I remember one of the things I saw when I was a kid on a newscast, you know, was a Vietnamese guy, a Vietcong guy getting his brains blown out on national TV, you know That didn't make me good Do that, you know, so Yeah, it made me want not want to do it, you know, because my brother was in was in Vietnam He was in the army and when I got my notice, he's like three years older and you know, he's so man don't Let don't let them draft you. They'll put you on the front line. I said, well, I'm going to enlist in the Air Force anyway. 

Recording: (1326/ 9621) 
 Oh, it was easy. 

Recording: (1327/ 9621) 
 He was a railroad clerk. 

Recording: (1328/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (1329/ 9621) 
 I'm really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me that's like okay come on I don't really want I don't want time to do this kinda relaxing stuff I just wanna get going and do the rest of this stuff so 

Recording: (1330/ 9621) 
 There you go. 

Recording: (1331/ 9621) 
 They weren't even allowed to believe in God. 

Recording: (1332/ 9621) 
 XD 

Recording: (1333/ 9621) 
 So therefore, they're not public. They can put whatever they want. 

Recording: (1334/ 9621) 
 I love Ohio State, but I guess from a career perspective, they say it's not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place. 

Recording: (1335/ 9621) 
 So I just came down here then. 

Recording: (1336/ 9621) 
 Really? And people use... Do people use them? 

Recording: (1337/ 9621) 
 Well, my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better if I slept at night instead of staying up. 

Recording: (1338/ 9621) 
 Oh, my sister is particularly religious and that tends to warp her view of everything. 

Recording: (1339/ 9621) 
 right I can understand how people do it because they come home from work and it's like I don't want to be a cook I don't want to be a cleanup So I'll pay somebody to do this pay somebody that and pretty soon you see all the money they've been making gone 

Recording: (1340/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. 

Recording: (1341/ 9621) 
 And that was part of the process there, how to work work and work up there too with people. But if we could just share more. 

Recording: (1342/ 9621) 
 because I've seen things that are not physically possible. 

Recording: (1343/ 9621) 
 You had to go home because mother was ill. 

Recording: (1344/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. It's nice. It works out well. 

Recording: (1345/ 9621) 
 I believe. 

Recording: (1346/ 9621) 
 Alright. 

Recording: (1347/ 9621) 
 But... 

Recording: (1348/ 9621) 
 We never used the word ever. But I'm sure plenty of people used the word on us, you know. But we shared everything that we had and supposedly we had a true sharing. But in terms of government, I don't, we weren't ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy. One woman who was decisive and made decisions and we wouldn't go along with her, you know. But if we could get ourselves to the place where it would work, that would be great. And I would very much, and the year that I lived in that community was one of the best years of my life, of us. 

Recording: (1349/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there's a big water area. It's something to do with the Little Mermaid or whatever. But they really enjoyed all this. We try to do as much as we can with them outdoor type of thing. We do a lot of camping. We do a lot of vacationing. We try to go to ice a year at least. Her parents live in Cape Cod, so they 

Recording: (1350/ 9621) 
 And we start them over again. They have never learned. And the reason why you're throwing a carrot out too much in front of them without saying, hey, you got to do this to prove this to me. No, we've lacked one heck of a lot of ethical, moral standards in this country. We're losing it every day until we start looking ourselves in the mirror at night and say, I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of what I did. I may not have made a dollar a day, but I understood somebody today. 

Recording: (1351/ 9621) 
 I thought it was very strange, but. 

Recording: (1352/ 9621) 
 I'd like to go out there overseas somewhere 

Recording: (1353/ 9621) 
谢谢 

Recording: (1354/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1355/ 9621) 
 Yeah plus I mean you save a lot of money too I mean. 

Recording: (1356/ 9621) 
 like. 

Recording: (1357/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1358/ 9621) 
 Well, a long time ago, when they signed the declaration and everything, they said, you know, build a fence around your place and take care of your own, you know. And I think basically that's the way the philosophy should be. I think there's times when you need to be, when we need to go help out other people, but we try to be too much of a policeman. 

Recording: (1359/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1360/ 9621) 
 Alright, well, as most people don't like to hear, relatives and stuff, I'm taking a year off. 

Recording: (1361/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1362/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry, yes. 

Recording: (1363/ 9621) 
 I mean, not saying that they had to believe what we believed, but just even just their attitude about life was so down. 

Recording: (1364/ 9621) 
 Now that's the Pokemon, and they're both. I heard somebody somewhere say, my five-year-old can name all 150 Pokemon characters but couldn't tell you his phone number. And that's true with mine. 

Recording: (1365/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1366/ 9621) 
 In any pregnancy, three weeks in either direction is considered full term. 

Recording: (1367/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm surprised they're not getting a lot of heat from that, but because that park's been there forever. 

Recording: (1368/ 9621) 
 That's gonna be a problem. They said bring water. You're gonna definitely, like they have no dress code, which is nice, so I'm just gonna wear shorts, some good walking shoes, and a t-shirt, because it could get rough. It could get real rough, I bet. 

Recording: (1369/ 9621) 
 Oh my god. 

Recording: (1370/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well I didn't realize that until I had kids. 

Recording: (1371/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1372/ 9621) 
 I mean, I'm sure at 19 I was saying some really bizarre things too. But you can tell that he's thought about it. 

Recording: (1373/ 9621) 
 All right, number one, none of them had the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted. When they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car, they had their car. They were not allowed to have my car and take it and run over to this kid's house or that kid's house. 

Recording: (1374/ 9621) 
 But when he first started out I liked him. He had on sensible things similar to almost what we're talking about now I think sometimes. But he in order to keep up with the I can't remember all the name of the shows that I don't watch but I'm doing old freeze one of them and all those other people it's just like her and of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they've done and all that malarkey and I think he decided he had to do same thing on his program or for him to keep his ratings up so you know see that's what you mean by giving in to what this person does over here And that's another thing we need to teach your kids because John Doe Jane Doe is doing it does not mean that is right Have the courage to be yourself and say no Some people might think you're terrible sometimes but 

Recording: (1375/ 9621) 
 And they say that's a city. And my school, or where I grew up, was more than double that, just over double that. It was like 60,000. 

Recording: (1376/ 9621) 
 you know, and these schools that have a thousand people, I just can't imagine. I mean, you know, my high school was like 400 people and we thought that was big at the time. And just to have a thousand people, excuse me, people, and just to try to monitor different things, I mean, it's got to be so hard, you know, and checking everything and 

Recording: (1377/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I live in Seabird Hall. Do you have friends who from Burlington who are also going to high school? Oh, yeah. I think there are 170 of us here just from my class alone. 

Recording: (1378/ 9621) 
 They used to have the laser light show downtown. They don't have it anymore. You know, just even if you do one thing free a month. 

Recording: (1379/ 9621) 
 You can do anything for $50 a week. You can work two hours a day for a week. And $50 for two kids is really not that much a week. 

Recording: (1380/ 9621) 
 Well, I think the people that made that law should also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it. 

Recording: (1381/ 9621) 
 and I had to get out. And other ones, it's a struggle with that thing and understanding it. It takes time to understand it. A lot of people, a lot of good people are helping me to try and understand it. I was trying to let the fear of that, though I'm not afraid to die, I'm afraid sometimes that I'll die before I get a chance to do what I feel I was sent here to do, which is just the basic things. Fall in love with somebody, have children, raise them. 

Recording: (1382/ 9621) 
 Me too, years ago. 

Recording: (1383/ 9621) 
 And my, but now my daughter's, my daughter has twin sons who just are a year out of college. And I think that they are, one of them particularly is, I think, in good moral, good sort of guy. And the other one I don't feel like I know as well, but I really think that they're both good. And, uh, see, 

Recording: (1384/ 9621) 
 Well, I work part-time, kind of, because I worked full-time when he was one. And I felt like the babysitters or whoever saw him more than I did. Because I love my son more than anything in the world. And I felt like he needed me. So I went down to part-time. I'm struggling more, but I'd rather see my son have me. 

Recording: (1385/ 9621) 
 I moved just moved into 161 Cleveland area. I lived up there for years, but I just moved back up there and Why I left it was because of the The city the traffic and everything where you get around campus, you know, it's a lot I mean, it's all hustle hustle hustle, but down here even with the kids and everything going to school, but basically it's kind of laid back. Where up there it's all go, go, go. 

Recording: (1386/ 9621) 
 Well, it's harder than I think in some ways than people think. I went to the Teach Ohio Fair last year to look around and didn't see that much interest in chemistry or general science teachers. I think the market has fluctuated back to a point where they don't need as many right now. They're not clamoring for us. 

Recording: (1387/ 9621) 
 Is there really? 

Recording: (1388/ 9621) 
 I think people are still fairly racist. I don't think it's near as bad as it was. But at the same time, I mean, I can't say I blame the white community so much for it. I would say it's probably both the white and, I guess, any other race relations fault. I mean, as far as, like, if you look at the black community, things like that, you have, like, have like BET, you have like the United Negro College Fund, things like that where they're almost segregating themselves by having these organizations because they're geared specifically towards black people. And I think in a way that's almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community because they're not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need them. It's sort of like the same thing white people were doing, you know, 30, 40 years ago, where that they had their white organizations or whatnot. And I think it's sort of going along the same lines where there is still a problem of it, but I think it has gotten better at least, if nothing else. 

Recording: (1389/ 9621) 
 where that nice mall is and some in Smyrna, which is outside of Atlanta, but girls that I met through school and stuff. 

Recording: (1390/ 9621) 
 But yet, that leaves a door open for who to get in trouble. 

Recording: (1391/ 9621) 
 I mean, I'm sure there is some, but it's not as extreme as some places that I've been. 

Recording: (1392/ 9621) 
 I think later on when he gets a little older he will be, you know, hey, cool. 

Recording: (1393/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1394/ 9621) 
 What'd you do? 

Recording: (1395/ 9621) 
 Oh, I'm sure. 

Recording: (1396/ 9621) 
 It's not that the property taxes are that much higher anyway, it's that the homes are worth more because of the school system. 

Recording: (1397/ 9621) 
 Definitely. Definitely. 

Recording: (1398/ 9621) 
 Oh it has you know your basic Lazarus which I like to go to Lazarus and Sears and JCPenney's and no I wouldn't want to drive to Polaris to go to those stores but if they made some outlets over there you know I'd be happy with that. There's just a lot of smaller stores you know like Victoria's Secrets and bookstores and toy stores and athletic wear stores. A lot of those I don't even go to. Get some kiosks set up outside you know with the little carts with different little things they sell just like your basic kind of mall.

 Put it so it fizzed and you pack it full and you had a gun.

 Yeah, yeah, yeah, we didn't go to court. 

Recording: (1408/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (1409/ 9621) 
 I read it. 

Recording: (1410/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's going to have to be from the bottom up I think. And everybody keeps, and I'm just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything. They're coming with 2000 on it. Well, I'm hoping people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it. But I'm hoping that it does mean, since people are so focused on it, it does mean a shift in consciousness, I hope. Y2K, I don't know what that really stands for. I have to think of some words there, but, you know, hope, since everybody is just making it into a big deal, that maybe it will be a big deal, you know. 

Recording: (1411/ 9621) 
 when I got here but I was in one of those you know youth stupid psychopathic relationships shall we say and I kind of needed to disappear and we never told him where she had just moved. 

Recording: (1412/ 9621) 
 And for some reason they omitted me then. 

Recording: (1413/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I got a class.

 Yeah, probably.

 company and they're the biggest landlord on campus I believe. 

Recording: (1416/ 9621) 
 No, I didn't know anybody in high school, but in college I know some people that have used coke. Ecstasy. It was more after the movie Go. 

Recording: (1417/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1418/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and a lot of performing arts. You were expected to take something in performing or visual arts every year, which was good for him. The Catholic think there seems to be the whole administration up through the board and just it's not as focused. I don't know how to describe it. It's like the teachers are sort of, it seems like they almost have the feeling they're on their own. Where it's more cohesive within the Catholic school, it seems to be very clear they're all going in the same direction and working as a team. I don't know, have you ever listened to any of the Columbus Board of Education meetings on the radio? 

Recording: (1419/ 9621) 
 And I heard the thing, you know, you're not my real father and all that. We went through all that. 

Recording: (1420/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (1421/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1422/ 9621) 
 I'm rusty. 

Recording: (1423/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I would have to work shift work. Yeah, so. 

Recording: (1424/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1425/ 9621) 
 Those were the two worst. 

Recording: (1426/ 9621) 
 Well, looking at me, you want a dollar more? And they're making thousands. But yeah, I don't want to do that anymore. I want to go somewhere. I've got somebody helping me, just an acquaintance of mine that's kind of a headhunter. And I've given him the idea that I want to either work for an attorney that's going to make some changes or do something that way. I've got a lot of administration and manager and things like that background. So I can have fun doing what I know how to do, but also accomplishing something. That's what I want to do. I haven't found it yet. I've got an interview with a radio station though, and that's kind of 

Recording: (1427/ 9621) 
 Well most kids what they do is they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the end. Most people get ahead of themselves. 

Recording: (1428/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I was like, whoa. Ed was like, oh I gotta figure out how to do that. I was like, you can't do that. I flipped out. Yeah, he broke into, oh my god, I can't remember what it was. But he had all these numbers for credit cards. And he was threatening to sell them on the internet. 

Recording: (1429/ 9621) 
 No, because I know people who are married don't take care of their kids. 

Recording: (1430/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm a Democrat. I've never voted for a Republican in my life, even when I lived in Oregon and I always adored Mark Hatfield. I didn't vote for him when I was out there. We're insane, because I thought he was a great Republican. But I think, personally, Mike Coleman was good. I've met, well, we had a Diamond Jubilee at the village and Coleman and Teter both came and they both, I thought it was in some ways kind of a close race. I mean, I didn't think that there was that much difference in them ideologically. I think, you know, she would do just about the same as he is. He might be a little bit better, but in terms of having a black mayor, I think that's good for Columbus, I think. 

Recording: (1431/ 9621) 
 Enjoy them now you get the terrible tease go through which is which is cool and I Remember one time when we get in a big argument one time when she when she turned teen teenager and I called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and I said there and said well, you know, I'm calling a long distance. She goes So I'm talking to my girlfriend. I said so what hang up on her and call her back and 

Recording: (1432/ 9621) 
 My older brother lived in Bloomington for a while and he ran a music store on this square in the center of town. It might have just been called Bloomington Music, I'm not sure. He sold guitars and things on the square right across from the courthouse. Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1433/ 9621) 
 So I think that's a problem too. Everybody says, well, I don't want to get there at 8.30. 

Recording: (1434/ 9621)

 Yeah, he's a father, definitely.

 It's like big deal, you know, common sense, it's hot. You don't put it in a sensitive area while you're driving to work. But she sued for 10 million and the paper said she won 10 million. She didn't. I mean, after that 10 million award was given by a jury, then the McDonald's is allowed an appeal at the end of a year. So she doesn't see any money for a year. And that's if they don't appeal. But 90% of these big corporations have the money behind them, they have lawyers behind them, so they can sue for an appeal. 

Recording: (1437/ 9621) 
 I was a professor. It was interesting. I mean, it's a lot. It's hard to remember a lot of terminology, but I enjoyed it. 

Recording: (1438/ 9621) 
 Typical dorm room. 

Recording: (1439/ 9621) 
 That's probably when they started, yeah. 

Recording: (1440/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's hard because I'm a Christian, so I believe that homosexuality is wrong. But like I said, I'm not going to condemn them at all. Like I said, I have friends. I understand what you're saying, but I think that's something more for the parents or the teacher to pick out. Maybe that child is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort and not actually incorporate it in a 30 student ensemble. It would be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it and then send them on that counseling one on one way. Just because if you're going to teach it to a large amount of students, I'm not even sure if that one student would listen because all the rest of them would probably be making cracks and just make them feel more. Do you know what I mean? 

Recording: (1441/ 9621) 
 That's pretty cool. 

Recording: (1442/ 9621) 
 Al Gore really doesn't entice me at all. He claims he invented the internet. 

Recording: (1443/ 9621) 
 I sort of agree with the fact that if someone wants a gun, they'll get a gun. It doesn't matter what they do to try to make it so people can't get their hands on guns. They're basically always going to be around and people are always going to get them if they want them. 

Recording: (1444/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (1445/ 9621) 
 No, not really. All my good friends from, well, I'd say like out of all my good friends from high school, one of them, no, two of them are still here. 

Recording: (1446/ 9621) 
 Well, what neighborhood do you live in? Because I see Asians and Indians everywhere, but boy, they don't live on my street. 

Recording: (1447/ 9621) 
 my stepmothers 

Recording: (1448/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you know, that's the thing. So I think just being aware. And then also, like I said, with all the, I mean, and I'm so opinionated in this too, and anybody that knows me, I look at all the advertising. I look at the advertising and I look through, and I see Lazars and I see Kohl's and I see Sears. You look through and you say, oh, okay, you know, you're looking for things to buy well Then you got a two whole two pages of women in bras and they're looking at the camera. They're seductively looking at the camera and You're like, okay, how many how many different bras do women really need that is not for the women? I'm sorry, you know most women by the time they're buying bras know what choices they have you don't need all that but then it's funny because then I keep flipping through and I look at the men. The men's heads are usually cut off. They're not wearing any kind of revealing underwear at all. I mean, it's just so unequal. So we leave these guys or these poor boys that are growing up. We push all this in, you know, and then expect them to deal with it. You know, and they see TV shows and everything else shows and everything else that it's okay to be with five women, but boy that woman is with more than one man. I think it's what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and what we're allowed to show our kids. You get involved in the free speech and that's fine, but wait until those kids grow up and wait until those people that were pushing the free speech get smugged or anything else happens to them. 

Recording: (1449/ 9621) 
 Not the actual going through it, you know. To me, it was to her, but the aftermath, basically, you know, you just... 

Recording: (1450/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1451/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1452/ 9621) 
 I mean, actually run over and killed. 

Recording: (1453/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Oh boy. It is. It's a lot of work. It really is. She's a nurse and she works at the Medical Center in the breast cancer department. She's a OR nurse. She's worked here for 22 years also. Got her degree at Ohio State. She grew up in Dayton and then moved here to go to college and then stayed at Ohio State after college. 

Recording: (1454/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1455/ 9621) 
 he can eat fresh water. 

Recording: (1456/ 9621) 
 Ah. 

Recording: (1457/ 9621) 
 And 

Recording: (1458/ 9621) 
 Oh, I think... 

Recording: (1459/ 9621) 
 I did. 

Recording: (1460/ 9621) 
 huh 

Recording: (1461/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1462/ 9621) 
 So that's, you know, a lot of my decisions were based upon that. 

Recording: (1463/ 9621) 
 But, you know, I think what they did was fairly good. They didn't really, as far as I remember, at that point at least, they didn't, well, they must have done, gone into the sort of moral issue. But what I remember was more of a scientific approach. 

Recording: (1464/ 9621) 
 for AMCs for not getting hurt. She works at FedEx and her crew is always getting hurt, mainly her. 

Recording: (1465/ 9621) 
 First year, yeah. Second quarter. 

Recording: (1466/ 9621) 
 No, no, but hopefully when they do get the one strike, somebody, I say somebody because right now I don't really think we have that in place, but we would need more of a one strike stepping stone. Let's face it, counseling's probably not gonna work, and somebody in that, it would almost take, I do personally know people that go into that type of environment here in Columbus and actually work with the families, and work with the kids, and actually are in there, living there, showing them, you know, it's one thing to go help them, and then leave that, and go home to your nice house. I don't, I admit it, I couldn't do it. But if people really did things like that, I think there'd be hope for them because they're actually friends or actually people that have been in that environment and come out. Those type of people I think might be able to reach them. I won't be able to reach them probably just because what do I know about it? Yeah, I agree. I don't think it'd be a deterrent at all initially, but if we had more things in place and somebody actually realized the background and tried to get them out of that, Hopefully, even if you save half of them, it's better than anything. 

Recording: (1467/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm not going to go to that world. I want you to go to that place. 

Recording: (1468/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1469/ 9621) 
 She's our guy, right? 

Recording: (1470/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (1471/ 9621) 
 Well, it was both, really, because there's kids who lived there since I lived there. That was 13 years ago. And being that long in the same neighborhood just doesn't really get it with me. 

Recording: (1472/ 9621) 
 No, not often. My daughter has a very intense life. And so I don't see them near as often as I like. We just do a one-day thing because it's fairly easy to drive to Toledo. So I go real early in the morning and spend six or seven hours with them and then come back. And she does the same thing. She comes down here and we just do the one day thing now because of the children. She worries about the children and blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, so it's better just to go. So I know what they're doing and everything, but I don't I'm not the old fashioned grandmother 

Recording: (1473/ 9621) 
 I guess. 

Recording: (1474/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1475/ 9621) 
 It is implicit thing is to like when we bought our house we had looked for months and months and months and I wanted an old house. It was built like 1917. I want an old house that hadn't been kept up. 

Recording: (1476/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it ain't gonna change that. 

Recording: (1477/ 9621) 
 Um, they did briefly like cover things like that with like religion and health classes, things like that. 

Recording: (1478/ 9621) 
 It's been remarkably well. I mean, I haven't had any problems. I found out pretty early, which was kind of strange at about four weeks. And I went in and I had a checkup. And my doctor, he thought I was about seven, but they wanted to do an ultrasound. Well, the thing is, they did this ultrasound, they didn't find anything. So, which was really kind of creepy, because they didn't know, because there's that whole tubal pregnancy thing and all this stuff. And the guy that did my ultrasound't my regular doctor and he's kind of, he's just a little abrupt for me and he says, well you know, if this is what it is, you know, you could have a lot of serious problems, you could die and all this stuff and I said wait a minute, I'm not ready for this but after we figured out that it was just the time period, other than that, it's gone really well. I mean, I just, and I know we just finished our Lamaze classes last night and there are some women in there, they're huge. I mean, these girls can't even get off the floor and I just feel really bad for them. So, for me, it's gone very, very well. I mean, I haven't really had any problems. 

Recording: (1479/ 9621) 
 I think my daughter Jennifer is very active, not so much the type of work that I do, but I think she's very charitable, very giving, very 

Recording: (1480/ 9621) 
 Well, I do think access is too easy, but it's sort of like anything else. I think if laws were passed, the people who were against it would be so, you know, just beside themselves that it would, I don't know for how long, but I think it would make the situation, not with the shootings and things like that, but I think it would make the, just the gun situation probably much worse for a while because people would be, you would be doing illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing. But too many people have guns here. There's too much of a gun culture. Over there, they've pretty much outlawed guns except for hunting and things. Of course there are some floating around, but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that, obviously England's such a small country in comparison, but I mean that's just amazing to me. But it's true, I mean the fact that the access is just, there's almost nothing barred, and I mean just the amount of people that I just hear sort of in conversation talking about, oh yeah, getting a gun for security and all this stuff. It's like your chances of number one, needing it, and number two, if you were in that just minute percentage, happen chance that you would need it, the fact that if you used it to shoot someone who wasn't, you know, I mean, everything is against you. 

Recording: (1481/ 9621) 
 Why I don't know. It doesn't make sense. 

Recording: (1482/ 9621) 
 Oh, it was on Saturday? 

Recording: (1483/ 9621) 
 Well, you know, in my girls, there are certain products that brand name, like one of them I know is the Meyer pudding that you can take for lunches, which they do. And it's like Edventure, you know, Edventure, but it's Edventure. Well, every once in a while, Hunts will be the same price and there'll be a coupon on the paper. So Joyce will, Joyce, we trade. She goes to the grocery store once, then next two weeks I go, and then next two weeks she goes. So she'll buy stuff like that with a coupon. And I go, why are you buying that? And she goes, it was cheaper than the Meyer brand. And then when we eat it, it's like it's too sweet, or it's too overpowering or too sugary. And the girls even think the same way. They go, we don't like this. It's too chocolatey. 

Recording: (1484/ 9621) 
 But would you say it's a nice place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there or would you actually live there? 

Recording: (1485/ 9621) 
 When, okay, when they, when that song came out, you would probably hear it at least 12 times a day on some of those radio stations. And it got to, I just, I cannot stand this. I can't stand it. 

Recording: (1486/ 9621) 
 I don't know, I would like to say no sitting here, but you never know because I guess that's what happens to a lot of them. They come out of school all idealistic and then they go into industry and then they're molded and assuming they make upper management, you want the tax breaks, you want the thing, you know what I mean? And then I have an uncle, he's a vice president on Wall Street for Merrill Lynch and he said, he got out of school and was very idealistic, but now he's like, oh those people, I made it through myself. Realistically he didn't. 

Recording: (1487/ 9621) 
 Think what? 

Recording: (1488/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (1489/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1490/ 9621) 
 and then Ohio, and then back down to Tennessee, and then back to Ohio. 

Recording: (1491/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1492/ 9621) 
 Oh, I don't know. It just seemed easier. Life was... I don't know. It just wasn't. The driving's the main issue with me. The freeways we have here weren't built for the amount of people that travel on them now. I remember when they built 71 North. I remember when they built 70 East. There were no freeways. I remember going up 315 when they first opened it and it was like nobody was on it. You could just drive on it and it was like an empty road that nobody knew about yet. Now it's like a parking lot every day. It's just a lot of different stuff about it. That and I don't know, it seems like activities to go do things, everything's more crowded. My wife thinks this city's the eat-out city. You know, everybody, if you go anywhere at 6.30, everybody and their brother's eating out all the time. It seems like constantly. We live near Mill Run, which is an area they've just built up in the last few years that just has like 20 restaurants in it. You drive by any of those at five, six o'clock, every lot's full to the brim. I don't care if it's Tuesday, Thursday, you know.

 Or you could do the University of Oregon. It's a very nice, very small university, but it's nice. 

Recording: (1494/ 9621) 
 and we could do what we wanted. 

Recording: (1495/ 9621) 
 when I first got a divorce. So it's been hard. 

Recording: (1496/ 9621) 
 that once you filter it through something it looks different but previous to that, yeah, there's a lot there. There's way too much shared experience to gloss over effectively. So when she said, look, if you never listen to anything else that I say, you will listen to this. You need to go to Europe. I was like, okay, I'll go to Europe. 

Recording: (1497/ 9621) 
 I had a conversation with her about it and said, you know, you didn't cause anything. Me and your mother caused it all. If anything, you were the brightest spot of the whole marriage. And that's the way you got to look at yourself when you see that reflection in the mirror. Remember that. 

Recording: (1498/ 9621) 
 sexuality and all 

Recording: (1499/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1500/ 9621) 
 your forceful personality too.

 Hehe 

Recording: (1502/ 9621) 
 where Northland is. 

Recording: (1503/ 9621) 
 Oh, it'll be. 

Recording: (1504/ 9621) 
 No, because all the kids take that California Achievement Test. I don't know if you're familiar with that. Say like you and I go to school. You go to Dublin and I go to the worst school in Columbus. And we both make straight A's. Well, when you take the California Achievement Test, the A's mean nothing. Because it's like, let's see what you understand and have learned. The score on that is what really matters to me. And both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those. Because they always pick on Columbus Public Schools. They go, oh, look how bad their test scores. Well, if you take, say, the worst school in town, which I don't know what it would be, but let's just say it's Brown School. Well, you have children there who have not seen dad in probably 10 years. And mom is basically sometimes there or in prison. So they live with grandma. How do you expect them to do well? Nobody's there to, you know, I'm not an ogre or anything, but I always keep tabs on my kids. I've always gone to conferences, even though they got straight A's. I go to conferences and teachers go, well, what do you come for? And I go, if I don't come, then it's like saying, I don't really care. So I always go. So they know that I'm keeping tabs on things. And I don't demand A's. I just demand them to do their best. And I said, you know, if your best is a C, then that's what it will be. But I said, if your best is an A and you're getting a C, you got me to talk to you. So back to the Brown school. There are kids like my daughter there who make straight A's and when they take the, what is that thing, the proficiency test, zoom through it and get like outstanding on it. And then you have, this probably sounds really biased or bigoted, but then you have the kid whose mom and dad aren't together and he comes to school maybe twice a week and when he takes a proficiency test he gets like a

 Like I had my kids last week, I had them all write how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And then I had them one by one come up to the table in the front. They didn't know I was going to do this. So after they got it all done, I go out and I get my little bag of stuff and I bring in my bread, my peanut butter, my jelly, and I sit them down beside me and I go, okay, now, no ad-libbing, no adding, no taking away. Read exactly what you wrote. 

Recording: (1506/ 9621) 
 And none of the other coaches did either. 

Recording: (1507/ 9621) 
 You played saxophone in the band. 

Recording: (1508/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1509/ 9621) 
 They're pretty much all underground things. They have a web page up. I'm not sure what the address is right now 

Recording: (1510/ 9621) 
 I mean, my kids went to a school that, well, my son had already left it, but in the fourth grade, they announced, took all the kids in the auditorium and said, we're closing next year. And it was hard, but once it's reached the point that decision is made and announced, then I think there were good reasons for it. And they explained the reasons, and at some point, you have to figure out how much do you want to fight something when it's inevitable. 

Recording: (1511/ 9621) 
 The mustiness, the old. 

Recording: (1512/ 9621) 
 Every kid that my kid ran around with, I knew his parents, one way or the other. 

Recording: (1513/ 9621) 
 You don't have too many options, you know? 

Recording: (1514/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1515/ 9621) 
 because the larger story was too large to film in one movie. But this one, as a part of a whole, I'm reserving complete judgment until 

Recording: (1516/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (1517/ 9621) 
 as a lot of mothers do. But she was there, and if they needed her for anything or needed her to say no to something, she was there. And I think that that probably had something to do with it. And the fact that our kids knew what our moral beliefs were, 

Recording: (1518/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1519/ 9621) 
 I don't think she'd have it any other way. 

Recording: (1520/ 9621) 
 Yeah, meet different people. 

Recording: (1521/ 9621) 
 Oh Lassie's one of them, yeah, along that line. 

Recording: (1522/ 9621) 
 Even if they don't pay me, it's still gonna be fun. 

Recording: (1523/ 9621) 
 I said, you have nothing like that for kids nowadays. 

Recording: (1524/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's like, I don't know, they used to have something called exploring posts that were directly related. And then Venturing kind of took over for that, like still in Boy Scouts. And then exploring went off on its own. And as a result, they took religion out of the program and they put, they allow homosexuality with the leaders and all that. So it's sort of like. So it's, I don't know, we call it like hippie Boy Scouts. 

Recording: (1525/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1526/ 9621) 
 and we pick out of those because otherwise your kid's gonna hate you. 

Recording: (1527/ 9621) 
 We had counter battery fire, we called it, which when they were shooting back at us, once in North Africa was kind of scary. We were in position where we could fire on a tank battle that was going on. We had a forward observer up there where he could look down and see the whole thing. And so he was adjusting fire and I don't know how many tanks they claimed that we hit, but 

Recording: (1528/ 9621) 
 And so it was kind of funny, but the discouraging, I mean it was discouraging when you see people that don't have any hope and. 

Recording: (1529/ 9621) 
 Child abuse. 

Recording: (1530/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1531/ 9621) 
 I don't know, I haven't really formed an opinion. 

Recording: (1532/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, yeah, yeah. I mean, it happened a lot. And I've had two abortions, one illegal and one legal. 

Recording: (1533/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my sister and her husband just moved back. They went out to Nebraska for a year. 

Recording: (1534/ 9621) 
 They're all in business. They work. They're scattered. I have a son in Sacramento and a son in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Recording: (1535/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1536/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's been like that every year, basically. 

Recording: (1537/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they won't bother it. 

Recording: (1538/ 9621) 
 You said a word there, government, government stays out of things. That's our problem. Government's into too many things. They need to be out of your nose. That's your personal business. They need to be out of your business. 

Recording: (1539/ 9621) 
 I just think it's sad even here in Columbus, you know, like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools. And I thought, you know, I just, you know, it's just because of all the things you've seen in the world in the last year that these kids want to do this just to see what's going to happen. 

Recording: (1540/ 9621) 
 Now what, that's industrial nucleonics or something like that. Well, think about it. Now you got the wetlands down there. Where are kids going to go? 

Recording: (1541/ 9621) 
 Cuyahoga Falls. 

Recording: (1542/ 9621) 
 I was born in Dayton, Ohio. I lived there almost 35 years before moving to Columbus in 1981. I lived in northwest Columbus for 18 years. I moved last January a little farther west, about five miles further west near Hilliard, but still live in the city of Columbus. So I've been here about 18, 19 years. I like Columbus also. I think it's a great city, although the last three months I've threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction. You just can't get anywhere. It's very frustrating. But other than that, Columbus is a great city. I went to, this is something different about me. Most people don't know that it existed in the 20th century, but I went to an all-girl Catholic school for 12 years. So there were no boys, I wasn't in a classroom with boys until I got to college. I went to college at Wright State University. My parents couldn't afford to send me, so I had to work two years in high school, two years after high school to pay my way through college. Taught school for about eight and a half, nine years, and during that time got my master's degree in remedial reading. Taught for, I think I said this, about eight and a half, nine years, and my life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teacher's association or teacher's union, and that led to a job in political action, because I'd always been active in politics from high school on. The first campaign I worked in was for John Kennedy in 1960. I was a freshman in high school and continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status, several different campaigns in Ohio and in Dayton where I came from, but moved to Columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union. Did that for a couple of years until I went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts. Did that, that's kind of stressful. So I decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that. I've never been married, didn't plan that, that wasn't a goal in life, it just never occurred. So I have no kids but I have a pet. And now I call myself semi-retired. I get a small monthly retirement and then I supplement my income by doing things like this. I'm an independent contractor. I do training, I do different things where people get my opinion. I've done a couple of things with lawyers looking, they do mock trials on real issues and then you listen to all of the stuff and then you, you know, pretend that you're a jury and come up with a decision. And I guess they use it in forming their case and going into court. So that's fun. So that's a little bit about me. I'd say my family, my mom and dad, well, my mother was first generation American. My grandparents came to this country from Hungary and that was a neat experience. I like growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in Hungary. And he thought this was the greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me. I still do also. He always voted so I learned at an early age that it's important to vote. My mom and dad were both alcoholics. I have two brothers, no sisters, one older than me, one younger than me. And I have no children, but I have a pet that is my child. And I always say pets are, children you raise, pets you spoil. So my pet is very spoiled. 

Recording: (1543/ 9621) 
 He went to Columbus schools and the kid didn't know what he had. He just found it laying around his father's car in the glove compartment, brought it in to show the other kids. That was very upsetting to my son. He was very sensitive. He used to be. Again, I don't know if that's normal for teenagers or not, but he used to be very sensitive to other people. I don't know if he is or he just won't let himself be right now. 

Recording: (1544/ 9621) 
 That's fine. 

Recording: (1545/ 9621) 
 They have to get a larger police department to do that. That's another thing. The cities have grown so much that we do not have adequate protection, I don't think, anymore. 

Recording: (1546/ 9621) 
 That's really true. 

Recording: (1547/ 9621) 
 I've been back there for about 10 years. I'd like to move back down there, but there just isn't any work, you know, unless you own your own company. So that basically is remodeling, drywall, stuff like that. 

Recording: (1548/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that was the most somebody could be ordered to pay, being unemployed. 

Recording: (1549/ 9621) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (1550/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it basically feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes. Exorbitantly high. It is a little higher, but it's not ridiculously high. 

Recording: (1551/ 9621) 
 They ain't gonna lock me up. 

Recording: (1552/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1553/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1554/ 9621) 
 I'd be taking in foster kids. I raised a little boy from the time he was born until he was six. Well, he was my friend. She's a single woman and she wanted to adopt, but she said she wouldn't adopt if a child would have to go to daycare. And this was when my daughter started kindergarten. And I said, if you get a baby, I'll take care of him until he starts school. 

Recording: (1555/ 9621) 
 You can see with the housing trends. And there again, it goes back to the stupid consumer. I say stupid consumer because when I was in college, I always said, well, the consumer had a fourth grade education level. 

Recording: (1556/ 9621) 
 just for the courses that I need. 

Recording: (1557/ 9621) 
 What else? 

Recording: (1558/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1559/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1560/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1561/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1562/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I just like doing it and I have a good set. My best friend is a realtor. She's since retired, but it's so funny because she would always go through all these statistics and this and that because the stuff I've done is in and because I live in area and so she would say, oh, I don't know. And she said, well, how much do you have to get it for and how much? And I would say, oh, I don't know. I think if I get it for under a hundred five, I probably can tell for a hundred forty if I this, this, this, and this. Now, you're going to put a lot of money into that, though. It's not like you're still only going to make maybe $10,000 profit. And she would say, well, I don't know. For a long time, she was always real skeptical, because I would just make up these numbers or just have this idea. And finally, she says, oh, Rachel, I don't know. It always works out for you. You always get that. So just do it. And it's just some intuition kind of thing. 

Recording: (1563/ 9621) 
 like it's like we're taking catalog orders over the phone it's not really a big deal like they're not seeing how we're dressed at all I mean they tell us which is where college church and stuff but nobody does like they don't really enforce it and they too they yell at like knife like for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we couldn't hug and they're like no that's like you can't hug in here or something like that they're like it takes away from the professional attitude it's like I don't even know what to say to people like that like this is like such a different like 

Recording: (1564/ 9621) 
 No, they're all boys. 

Recording: (1565/ 9621) 
 I think that would be perfect. 

Recording: (1566/ 9621) 
 Um, 

Recording: (1567/ 9621) 
 I used to kind of worry about the effect that TV had on me. When I was little, I used to watch a lot of TV. I'd come home from school and plop myself in front of the TV and watch four cartoons back to back or so every day after school. That kind of thing. And then Saturday mornings, it would be a block of from six in the morning until afternoon or something. These days, I don't watch nearly that much TV. I don't buy these arguments that people make that say that, like, children are... Like, violence in TV is affecting children. I mean, I've seen some evidence of exercises where in schools, kids will watch a violent cartoon, like Roadrunner or something, and then be a little rougher. But I don't think that it goes into values. I don't associate like rise in crime or something with Like crime on TV or something. I mean if there is a correlation, yeah, I'm more of the you know, like You know Parents have a greater influence on the children than TV ever could I mean I like watched a lot of TV, but I feel that my parents taught me what was right and wrong. I watched a lot of rather violent TV, violent movies, all that kind of thing. 

Recording: (1568/ 9621) 
 i remember mcguffey lane and if you know 

Recording: (1569/ 9621) 
 Nope, not my area. Not my area. If it's hot in here. 

Recording: (1570/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, there's always people out there. 

Recording: (1571/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but he's always, he's had like girlfriends where he's lived with them and he had a child and they lived together but he cheated on her. 

Recording: (1572/ 9621) 
 So that means you're a good problem solver, you're a good logical thinker, you're good in science, you're good in math, you know. So there's a few things you're not good at. It doesn't mean you're stupid, you know. I'd much rather be stranded on an island with six 

Recording: (1573/ 9621) 
 You know, we really don't know much about his life away from home. 

Recording: (1574/ 9621) 
 They cannot understand where you're coming from. 

Recording: (1575/ 9621) 
 Hehehe 

Recording: (1576/ 9621) 
 Cause it's hard being the only girl in the house. 

Recording: (1577/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (1578/ 9621) 
 Ugh. 

Recording: (1579/ 9621) 
 I think they fly to Omaha, so it's not too bad. That's pretty easy to get into. 

Recording: (1580/ 9621) 
 And as with a lot of the resentment that's felt that I experienced toward Americans, rather saddeningly, I think our culture is starting to really infuse itself into Europe at least. I mean, I see instead of us becoming more like them, them becoming more like us. Walmart has bought a big retailer there. 

Recording: (1581/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1582/ 9621) 
 She's grown, she's expanded her horizons, if you will.

 😂 

Recording: (1584/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (1585/ 9621) 
 I never liked meat. My parents always made me eat it once I went away to college. And I said, I'm not going to eat anymore. And they're like, oh, well, we'll see. And I've never eaten anything since. 

Recording: (1586/ 9621) 
 trying to raise my hopes up about it, but then they had this other kid who was actually really into veterinary medicine and flying helicopters and all that. And he really did go on to study about that myself, Cook. 

Recording: (1587/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, Archbishop Romero, yeah, in El Salvador. That's right. That's right, that's right, yes. So there are conservative and progressive wings in every religion, I'm sure. Even probably Unitarian Universalist, although I've heard that the more conservative Unitarian churches are in New England around Boston, where it was started. And there are some that are relatively conservative there. But for the most part, it's what you would call liberal religion. Yeah. Are you? 

Recording: (1588/ 9621) 
 Right. Yeah, well you can't even put a price on it either. 

Recording: (1589/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (1590/ 9621) 
 Well, after graduating from the state, I've been here 30 some years and employed now with the transportation department. I started out in the finance area with the, and then when the divestiture of the Bell system occurred in the country, I was drafted to head up and develop a telecommunications section within ODOT. And so currently I'm, I used to be the manager of telecommunications at ODOT, but now I'm the special project coordinator for telecommunications at ODOT. And in addition, I'm a cruise agent in preparation for retirement. So I've been working on that and I got my accredited affiliation with Cruise Line International here this last year. And so I'm ready to go cruising. 

Recording: (1591/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (1592/ 9621) 
 Yeah, those are nice. 

Recording: (1593/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1594/ 9621) 
 where it took me to. 

Recording: (1595/ 9621) 
 You can hit the road if you want. Of course, the only thing he had was nothing

 pretty much anywhere in Delaware that I can find.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1598/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1599/ 9621) 
 Man, stressful. The older you get, the more stressful it gets. I mean, I remember when I was 17 and I was out having my good old fun and taking care of things. 

Recording: (1600/ 9621) 
 listen to music. 

Recording: (1601/ 9621) 
 See, I'm not sure if universal health care would be the thing. I think it was my freshman year, my sister and I went to Donasila, the

 That's right. 

Recording: (1603/ 9621) 
 I don't hear you. 

Recording: (1604/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, and then my other sister just recently got divorced this year. Or I guess it was finally ended last year. And she's got two kids, raising them. And so they're all, most of them except for Linda and Bobby. Bobby's the one in Connecticut and Linda's in Akron. But everybody else is within 10 minutes of each other. 

Recording: (1605/ 9621) 
 Gotten somewhere else. 

Recording: (1606/ 9621) 
 And that's what I like about it, is the ambience and the river and the apartments are just very, very plain. 

Recording: (1607/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1608/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1609/ 9621) 
 Okay, well I'm not really from Columbus either. I've been here for a little over a year now. My husband went to high school here and had a daughter while he was in high school. So after he finished college, he wanted to relocate here. And we kind of lived between Worthington and Westerville, kind of North Columbus. And I like it a lot. 

Recording: (1610/ 9621) 
 No, it's very much so.

 been highly critical of organized religion. 

Recording: (1612/ 9621) 
 None of it means kind of the traditional light at the like a big tunnel with a bright light at the end or they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene. Seeing a dead relative. Something like that. 

Recording: (1613/ 9621) 
 But she's doing fine. She was dating somebody. I don't know whether they really got married or not, you know, because I don't really have that much communication with her. But some guy younger than her. I talked to him. He seemed like a pretty decent guy. 

Recording: (1614/ 9621) 
 Of course, my wife's worked in higher education for 30 years, so. 

Recording: (1615/ 9621) 
 She couldn't understand, except the fact that you could just disagree with her. It had to be because she was black or she was an older woman. You couldn't just disagree. Had to be a reason there. But fortunately, she accused me of that in front of my boss who was black, who didn't believe it. He knew better, so. 

Recording: (1616/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (1617/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1618/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they were troubled kids in the past. They came from troubled backgrounds, they did. 

Recording: (1619/ 9621) 
 until they start getting a little bit better equipment, because the equipment is really ancient. I mean, there's stuff there that's older than I am. But like Port Columbus is getting a new tower. It's supposed to be done in about three and a half years. And the equipment they're getting is all brand new stuff. It's not like they're taking all the old junk we've got and moving it over there. So that will help. And nationwide, they're also putting new stuff in. But the bad part is picture your father is your father computer literate okay he's at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go everybody's gonna put all their work on computer well 

Recording: (1620/ 9621) 
 Um, no, actually now I live in Hilliard. 

Recording: (1621/ 9621) 
 for alcohol, like on your breath at all. 

Recording: (1622/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1623/ 9621) 
 because the problem with guns in my opinion is you don't have to think to use it. It takes, you know, you don't have to sit there and load it. In a split second I think we all are capable of shooting somebody for whatever reason, you know, just stupidity or whatnot. Just in a split second, you know, we might have that once in a life, but we can kill somebody that quickly. And you can't go, oh, you know. 

Recording: (1624/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1625/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1626/ 9621) 
 Relations, but they're normal people outside of their homosexuality. I mean, it's nothing different than regular parents 

Recording: (1627/ 9621) 
 Because they got beaches and yeah. I don't think Lake Erie can compare. That would hurt. 

Recording: (1628/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (1629/ 9621) 
 to GI's. 

Recording: (1630/ 9621) 
 Mmm 

Recording: (1631/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1632/ 9621) 
 Oh, OK. It doesn't have the equalizer thingy. 

Recording: (1633/ 9621) 
 Well, I think I'm trying to stay on, maybe I'm deviating too much. 

Recording: (1634/ 9621) 
 No, I don't fear none of the kids. 

Recording: (1635/ 9621) 
 to the Art and Tech Department. 

Recording: (1636/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1637/ 9621) 
 You know, and when I came back here, I had moved to Kentucky. I came back here, I'd say 1973. 

Recording: (1638/ 9621) 
 Well, I think in general, like let's say if you took a handful of executives from Borden or AT&T or someplace like that, you would probably find that in general they're very concerned. 

Recording: (1639/ 9621) 
 I do not like busing. I just don't. I think it's kind of like you get what you pay for. 

Recording: (1640/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but just to see the church might be fun. We, about how many years ago, seven or eight years ago, decided to build a new worship center building. And because we were really too big for the sanctuary that we had, 

Recording: (1641/ 9621) 
 Good, my son. 

Recording: (1642/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, me either. 

Recording: (1643/ 9621) 
 So that's all the required. I'm thinking about taking some extra anyway, just because I like it. 

Recording: (1644/ 9621) 
 enough to satisfy me. So that was good. 

Recording: (1645/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1646/ 9621) 
 That wouldn't bother me at all. 

Recording: (1647/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1648/ 9621) 
 So I spent the best six months of my life in New York. 

Recording: (1649/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. for a year and I got hassled about my hair. Told me the only thing keeping me from moving up in the company was a pair of scissors. 

Recording: (1650/ 9621) 
 seen all the nice things just everywhere. I couldn't believe it. But now it's easy to take it for granted again. Just, I'm back home. 

Recording: (1651/ 9621) 
 Which one's that? 

Recording: (1652/ 9621) 
 Oh you have? It's like, man, after I heard that I said, that's not even worth calling, I said, they're gonna be rude. 

Recording: (1653/ 9621) 
 Well, I think at that age, the parents should be involved. And hopefully, they'll be open-minded enough to know that this is going to be something she's going to have the rest of her life. I'll tell you what, with today's world and some of these 14-year-olds that look like they're 20 and, you know, they know what they're doing. And no, they shouldn't keep repeating that. I just think the most important thing is for them to be able to have the option. I really do. But yes, the parents should be involved. I'd say to the age 17 maybe. I think they should have a parent's consent and hopefully the parents will love their daughter enough to realize what a mistake it's going to be if she's going to be a young mother and then eventually maybe not even want to be a mother. You know, I mean, there's a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just, they kill them. You know, and there's so much of that for a while there that was going on and it's like, I can't believe these women are doing this. You know, they just snap. 

Recording: (1654/ 9621) 
 But I had a note in before I had the heart attack. I'd already had two heart attacks. I had a note in that I needed to be on first shift or I'd probably have another heart attack. And they would not put me on first shift. Then I had another heart attack. Put me in the hospital. Then I had another heart attack when I was in the hospital. And when I came out, that's when I gave them another note stating I needed to really be on first shift. 

Recording: (1655/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1656/ 9621) 
 And we called it the Taj Mahal because they'd spilled bunches of information into it, or bunches of money. 

Recording: (1657/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1658/ 9621) 
 Oh hell yeah, look at you man. 

Recording: (1659/ 9621) 
 Well, that's an interesting thing. I'm not in geology right now. I'm actually making more money right now in music than I am in geology. But I'm making most of my money in something that's irrelevant to most of my, that has nothing to do with any of my studies. Yes, I play principal horn in the symphony orchestra. And last year I was in a professional singing group, but I'm also in a number of volunteer choirs. The choir at the First Unitarian Universalist Church in... And a small choir where I work, which I got the opportunity to conduct today because the conductor was not at work. So I do a lot of music in my spare time, mostly. But unfortunately, I didn't get a job in geology, and I don't have a full-time job in music either. Either one of those would be nice, but I— 

Recording: (1660/ 9621) 
 I remember, you know, we'd like go to a pool hall or something, you know, a bar actually, you know, and it'd be, but we'd play pool, you know, they wouldn't let us drink or nothing because we were underage, but that was basically the guys, you know, and the girls would go over to somebody's house, you know, and then we'd meet up later on, you know, and go our separate ways or, but drive-ins back then, you know, we get a movie. Mm-hmm. So As far as going shopping that wasn't really something that was a bigger thing. I Was maybe a Saturday thing with mom and dad, you know, cuz they had the money, you know, hmm 

Recording: (1661/ 9621) 
 You know, I'm just one of the kids. Hi, mom, you know. And I guess it's true. And I've always wondered, you know, I turned 18. I thought, well, shouldn't I feel like an adult now? You know, I was 21. Shouldn't I start to feel like this responsible 25? Shouldn't I be an adult? You know, and I wonder, at what point do you really feel like you are on that other side, or you're one of the grown-up people instead of one of the little people? And maybe that's when. 

Recording: (1662/ 9621) 
 you know, just experiencing someone for who they are. And so she's 

Recording: (1663/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (1664/ 9621) 
 Yeah, Harvey Keitel. 

Recording: (1665/ 9621) 
 I picked legal secretary also, but I chose law enforcement over that because I got a substance to that too. 

Recording: (1666/ 9621) 
 I mean, now. 

Recording: (1667/ 9621) 
 They're trying. It just doesn't seem like they're thinking ahead. 

Recording: (1668/ 9621) 
 And as a result, like their kids my age and stuff like that that I've talked to, I mean, they have no idea what's going on. 

Recording: (1669/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (1670/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1671/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. 

Recording: (1672/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1673/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they don't know about it but then, you know, they, like you said, they don't want to see it. 

Recording: (1674/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1675/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (1676/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1677/ 9621) 
 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다. 

Recording: (1678/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1679/ 9621) 
 Where do you do the aerobics? 

Recording: (1680/ 9621) 
 You know? So I think maybe not universal health care, but for children I think it would be helpful. 

Recording: (1681/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1682/ 9621) 
 That's funny. 

Recording: (1683/ 9621) 
 I think that the stories haven't been, some of my favorite lines from The Simpsons are where they're highly critical. One of my favorites is the one where Bart thinks he loses his soul, which in some ways is kind of preachy. Lisa takes other positions, like whether the soul is real, it doesn't matter, da da da da but I love one scene whether cleaning out the Barton Milhouse are being punished they're cleaning out the pipes of the organs and the pipes of the organ and like Bart's like there's no such thing as a soul Milhouse is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain? And then it cuts to Reverend Lovejoy emptying the tip jars, the donation thing, into a little change counting machine. Like, I don't hear cleaning. What would they have to gain? 

Recording: (1684/ 9621) 
 Definitely. And it really makes you aware of your own mortality. I mean, things you see every day. I mean, you never know. It could happen to anybody, anytime. Just like that accident yesterday with, um, right. 

Recording: (1685/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (1686/ 9621) 
 What?

 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.

 kids. 

Recording: (1689/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (1690/ 9621) 
 She wants to go to Columbus State. Wants to get into one of their engineering tech programs. And I hope she does. She never fit in in high school. She's very bright. She's mature in many ways, but she's had to be responsible for herself her whole life. 

Recording: (1691/ 9621) 
 my family, and I'll see them face to face and I'll recognize them and they'll recognize me. But something transcends them because as I look to them, unlike when they're on earth, my goodness, we're taught to learn the most negative thing about a person. Psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper, you the dot on the thing. You don't see the other 99% of the paper you see that dot. It's gonna be just the opposite in heaven. I can't think of a negative thing about you. And the reason why you can't think of a negative thing about them because you see Christ's appearance comes through them. 

Recording: (1692/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1693/ 9621) 
 I don't, I don't... 

Recording: (1694/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1695/ 9621) 
 Not an immediate family going back like you did there. I know there there's a murder murder in our family. Oh they've been horse thieves. I'm going on back now. I'm not thinking in terms of the current family but basically what I was talking about a while ago is current families somewhat current. 

Recording: (1696/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (1697/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1698/ 9621) 
 laughs 

Recording: (1699/ 9621) 
 I guess I'm also sure I wish they would celebrate every holiday so then they're exposed to all of it instead of none of it. 

Recording: (1700/ 9621) 
 I went there one day and ate my lunch all the time for two weeks and they paid me $10 for that. 

Recording: (1701/ 9621) 
 less fortunate out there and that there's little things we can do. 

Recording: (1702/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and yeah, so I. 

Recording: (1703/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it sucked. I mean, I don't have it like my sister. She's puking every day. 

Recording: (1704/ 9621) 
 What? 

Recording: (1705/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1706/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1707/ 9621) 
 Let's just change the language. 

Recording: (1708/ 9621) 
 Um, there were people I met through friends. Um, actually, one of my friend's parents had a friend that was gay. Um, just be over there, whatever. I mean, I can't say there's any big difference between 

Recording: (1709/ 9621) 
 They can't see nothing wrong with that. 

Recording: (1710/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was just like there was a lot of people there who you know like their parents were farmers and or they they were whatever you know it was like like preppy kids or like hick type kids you know who 

Recording: (1711/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (1712/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (1713/ 9621) 
 How many people want that? 

Recording: (1714/ 9621) 
不還好 

Recording: (1715/ 9621) 
 You have to take a foundation of courses. 

Recording: (1716/ 9621) 
 Ow. 

Recording: (1717/ 9621) 
 Exactly. I think that would deter people. You get one strike and you're like, uh oh, maybe I better clean up my act here. 

Recording: (1718/ 9621) 
 And none of the animals they profiled were pets. I mean, a 36-foot-long python, what the hell's a person doing with that as a pet? And they shouldn't be allowed to. And then people treating a buffalo like they could stand next to it and take a family picture. 

Recording: (1719/ 9621) 
 And you either accept it or you don't. 

Recording: (1720/ 9621) 
 It was pretty far. The city actually had a million people that I lived in most of the time. But it was the government that ran it actually was still communist. 

Recording: (1721/ 9621) 
 support her living conditions or whatever. 

Recording: (1722/ 9621) 
 What would you go with? 

Recording: (1723/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1724/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, you know. 

Recording: (1725/ 9621) 
 Why do I think that is? 

Recording: (1726/ 9621) 
 Yay Joe. 

Recording: (1727/ 9621) 
 You know, what kind of an answer is that? Even if your answer is, I don't know why you can't do it, it just makes me uncomfortable. You know, that's a lot more fair than because I'm the boss of you or something like that. And I think if you respect your kids and just kind of set boundaries with them, you know, kind of try to be, I don't know, that's the way my family's always been and it always seems to work really well for us. 

Recording: (1728/ 9621) 
 Well it's good now, well the web again has changed that, computers have made a big difference, it's more exciting now for people in that area who are interested. It's more emphasis on information and not books and things, going to the library is getting the information. 

Recording: (1729/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (1730/ 9621) 
 My mom works for the Columbus Public Schools. 

Recording: (1731/ 9621) 
 Right, exactly. Oh, you're in our neighborhood. Yeah, you're, exactly. Oh. 

Recording: (1732/ 9621) 
 Since I was five, that makes it 20 years. 

Recording: (1733/ 9621) 
 It's all documented. 

Recording: (1734/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (1735/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they have a deal on Monday and Tuesday. I think it's like after 5 p.m. 

Recording: (1736/ 9621) 
 exercise that. 

Recording: (1737/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1738/ 9621) 
 You can't 

Recording: (1739/ 9621) 
 Yeah, G-O-R-K-A. I think he's originally from Pittsburgh. 

Recording: (1740/ 9621) 
 Now most people don't want to take time. Nowadays it's easier just to get a kit of beeper. 

Recording: (1741/ 9621) 
 No, I've had friends go. I was gonna go to one on Halloween, but didn't. 

Recording: (1742/ 9621) 
 and I do exactly what they said. If they say cover the entire piece of bread with peanut butter, I cover both sides. 

Recording: (1743/ 9621) 
 Right, yeah. 

Recording: (1744/ 9621) 
 He's a disappointment. 

Recording: (1745/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (1746/ 9621) 
 then that was always her main focus. 

Recording: (1747/ 9621) 
 I was living with my mom and like half and half like joint custody or whatever I was in with my mom and half with my dad and then when my dad moved to Florida I moved with him and then my mom ended up getting remarried and like my dad had remarried by that time too and my mom remarried and they lived moved out to Sunbury in like this house on five acres or whatever and so then when I came back I just lived with her up there 

Recording: (1748/ 9621) 
 Oh, I know. They don't care. They got money, people. Goddamn. 

Recording: (1749/ 9621) 
 Is that where you got married? 

Recording: (1750/ 9621) 
 It's a very spiritual experience. Yes, it gets hot in there. How hot? Who knows? But it's been such a strengthening, spiritually strengthening thing. It also physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat. It gets all the crap out of you. 

Recording: (1751/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1752/ 9621) 
 And so he was in the hospital in Japan for some time and then came home. But he never would never say a lot about it. 

Recording: (1753/ 9621) 
 Oh boy, like action, oh, fight the bad guys, yeah. And now it's, you know, like looking and sort of postulating deeper meaning to what the characters have to go through using elements of the story as a metaphor for things in real life. And the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a child and upon our culture, I think it's kind of interesting. And now that it's coming back out, I mean, I look at things from a little different perspective. But I mean, yeah. Of the maybe, I think I've done about 10, 12 paintings of which I'm like, consider to be done and like, 

Recording: (1754/ 9621) 
 And I don't know if it's quite that bad, but it was certainly some things that he's been doing that aren't proved up, and I'm not real up on that. 

Recording: (1755/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1756/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like when I do the silk screening and this is kind of random, but just anything. 

Recording: (1757/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1758/ 9621) 
 One of my best friends from high school and my boyfriend are both in it. And they had bugged me about it forever to come. And I'm like, I don't know about computers. So they took me finally like December or something. 

Recording: (1759/ 9621) 
 Of course with ours, if you hit, you didn't have to hit them direct, you could hit them right beside them and flip them over. 

Recording: (1760/ 9621) 
 They used to have a shelter house in the summer. They held teen dances every weekend. 

Recording: (1761/ 9621) 
 Maybe I should go back and get a degree in electrical engineering, that would be a lot of fun. 

Recording: (1762/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, I tried and tried. I just see it that he's not changing. And you keep hoping, you just keep hoping. But it's all upon him. And obviously, he doesn't love me enough to really want to change and settle down. He still wants to do those things he's doing. And I just need to move on. 

Recording: (1763/ 9621) 
 and get some information. 

Recording: (1764/ 9621) 
 Haha. 

Recording: (1765/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1766/ 9621) 
 If they can't say it in three months, they can't say it in eight months. 

Recording: (1767/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1768/ 9621) 
 And that was like around Christmas time. And I ran into him like February or something like that. And ever since February, he's been sitting on a bench getting drunk every day. 

Recording: (1769/ 9621) 
 less in America than there are. 

Recording: (1770/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (1771/ 9621) 
 So many normal people in! 

Recording: (1772/ 9621) 
 Well, my one friend went to a school in Philadelphia for a while, but she didn't, she went to a, like a university arts, which is a, like a theater school. And it was real, like intense or whatever, you know, it's like double the workload of a normal college. So she didn't like that. So she came back and was kind of in the same situation that I was, like not really knowing what to do or whatever. And then my one friend who we're living with, he goes here, he likes it, I guess. I don't know. 

Recording: (1773/ 9621) 
 Sounds a lot like our dog. 

Recording: (1774/ 9621) 
 That's where we need to correct. 

Recording: (1775/ 9621) 
 Mhm, art. 

Recording: (1776/ 9621) 
 This is in the summer now, we go down to Old Tangier River to go fishing. Over there where Doddridge is, there used to be a bass recreation center with a miniature golf course and everything. 

Recording: (1777/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1778/ 9621) 
 Yes, pets are. 

Recording: (1779/ 9621) 
 No, I think I'm perfectly content. 

Recording: (1780/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1781/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm figuring middle of January is my guess. School starts, I think, the 5th of January. And then we're going to go that. I don't know. It's weird, because I've had a job since I was 14. 

Recording: (1782/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah, they gave us $10,000. Here's $1. Have fun. 

Recording: (1783/ 9621) 
 I grew up in Cincinnati. I went to school at Rhode Island School of Design, went east to school. Came back to, got married and came back to Cleveland, lived there for a while. Met my husband hitchhiking back from school one year. And then when he went to graduate school in Columbus, I came down here. And don't have Mr. Sturgill with us anymore, but I stuck. 

Recording: (1784/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (1785/ 9621) 
 Well, I was born on a homestead out in northern Montana. And then my parents moved back to Iowa, which was their home area, southern Iowa. And I grew up there, attended high school there. Then I went to Iowa State for five quarters and I just didn't get it. And then I worked around home for a year and then I went into the Army in 1940, spring of 1941 before Pearl Harbor. And I was in service for four and a half years in Italy most of that time, North Africa and then Italy. And I had met a girl before I went into service, and so when I got home, we were married, and she had family out here in Columbus. 

Recording: (1786/ 9621) 
 But you can also grow with respect. You can work with the community and still gain respect from the community and you'll have allegiance. But nowadays we don't have any loyalty at all. It's out the window. And that's why I fear the most you're saying on the internet, eh, yeah, big deal. You're going out there for what you want. Well, maybe some people want low cost. They don't want service. OK, boom, disposable. That's a problem we have in our society today because of one thing. We're trying to communicate, as you say, through the internet and through businesses. But we don't have compassion, and we don't have commitment. Without those three, you'll never have success. 

Recording: (1787/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (1788/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (1789/ 9621) 
 Well, I mean, as I mean, like I was saying, I he's at the ages where he needs to, you know, start learning things. And she just does not do that. And that's probably the way she raised her kids. But no, we have totally different opinions about everything. 

Recording: (1790/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (1791/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1792/ 9621) 
 I was good in the interview. I knew what I was doing. I kind of wish I hadn't been as prepared. But it was a lot of the people, I moved into a management position. It was a lateral move. It wasn't even a pay raise or anything. It was a lateral move. And the people that I was supervising, some of them had been doing it for 20 years. And they made it very clear to me that they knew the program and I didn't. 

Recording: (1793/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (1794/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1795/ 9621) 
 Neither one of us can remember it, so I don't know. 

Recording: (1796/ 9621) 
 than would be with the black president and I think it would cause problems. I don't know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it, but I definitely could see here, definitely would think that people would be arguing about it, yelling about it, and making a bigger deal about it. 

Recording: (1797/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (1798/ 9621) 
 Well, because I've been in public schools all my life, and I should be the first to know that there's a lot of favoritism. Some teachers will teach one, but not teach the other. 

Recording: (1799/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1800/ 9621) 
 All of them, the university is divided up in different areas and there's a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas. Usually there are about 20 buildings or so. Ours is in the northeast area from Wexner down through the Oval to, I don't know, about Derby or so around in there and then on over to Woodruff. 

Recording: (1801/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but I've got more influence, I think. Maybe, I'm not sure. I'm hoping I've got more influence over him than his father does. 

Recording: (1802/ 9621) 
 They wrote a song, probably their most famous one, it was called Green Grass and High Times Forever. I don't know if that was what it was called. 

Recording: (1803/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1804/ 9621) 
 And I was trying to do everything and then also too they wanted me to go to therapy. 

Recording: (1805/ 9621) 
 Be exciting. 

Recording: (1806/ 9621) 
 His mom was June Cleaver. 

Recording: (1807/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because my friend has some place where she even teaches yoga and has, she's real involved in it. She goes to, the one I told you was the realtor, but I should find out where that studio is. If I find out, I'll let you know. Because I know she goes to some place called Kripalu in Pennsylvania from time to time. And who knows? I just, I don't really do it for the meditation or anything. 

Recording: (1808/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (1809/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1810/ 9621) 
 was six normal kids because LD kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there and the normal kids would sit and cry. 

Recording: (1811/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1812/ 9621) 
 When you go over there and you see people begging for a can of beans. 

Recording: (1813/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1814/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (1815/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1816/ 9621) 
 It sure works for me. 

Recording: (1817/ 9621) 
 He's an educator, which is all the more reason to homeschool. Because he sees it and he's like, yeah, they. 

Recording: (1818/ 9621) 
 well he's polite I'll give him that much. 

Recording: (1819/ 9621) 
 That's our planet. 

Recording: (1820/ 9621) 
 Oh gosh, a whole lot more people. 

Recording: (1821/ 9621) 
 It's not that I wouldn't keep talking, but you probably sort of have a limited... Yeah. 

Recording: (1822/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (1823/ 9621) 
 I'm hoping that'll be the same experience as it is in Ohio State. 

Recording: (1824/ 9621) 
 Which one are you talking about? 

Recording: (1825/ 9621) 
 And I just thought, I just don't like this. Is this something that, when I look long term, is this something that I want to deal with for the rest of my life? And I said, no, it just isn't. And I think that you have to look at and see if you're compatible with somebody before people get into situations and they marry people that you just, from the outside you can look and you can think, are you nuts? That is never going to work. So I think that you just kind of have to take you know, are you compatible? Do you really feel like this is something that's going to work and be positive? I don't know if I'm old enough to do anything yet. 

Recording: (1826/ 9621) 
 So it probably wasn't unexpected. We just weren't prepared for it. I don't think you could be prepared for it. 

Recording: (1827/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (1828/ 9621) 
 And nothing happens, over here, yeah. 

Recording: (1829/ 9621) 
 Basically last time I heard he was doing lawn care. He's done about everything like I told him, you know Get as many jobs as you can till you figure out what you want to do. He's done Maintenance work. He's done sales work. I Say he's doing lawn care now. He's done gardening His girlfriend they live together he's not married like I said, he a kid. They've been together for about four years, but a lot of times he'll work for her dad. 

Recording: (1830/ 9621) 
 Just like almost out of control. 

Recording: (1831/ 9621) 
 That's my dad has red hair and blue eyes, so. 

Recording: (1832/ 9621) 
 Yes, I will go back to full-time most definitely when he's in school If I could find something part-time that pays more that's what I'm looking for to do 

Recording: (1833/ 9621) 
 It's been a lot of problems with him. He's a brilliant kid. They told us in elementary school he had the highest IQ they'd ever had tested. He's very creative, very talented musically. He was taking lessons from Gene Walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university. And he said that he thought Charlie had the makings to be a professional, make a living career as a jazz saxophonist. But there's also in the last four years or so a lot of mental health problems. 

Recording: (1834/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (1835/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1836/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1837/ 9621) 
 I like to try new recipes, I do like to do that. But I don't think that I do a lot of real European cuisine necessarily. But I do look at recipes and enjoy eating the food too. 

Recording: (1838/ 9621) 
 I make little side bets, not necessarily money. You know, just haha for fun. Sometimes I did get money for it though. It wasn't too bad. I mean, you know, it's not like some kind of racketeering deal. 

Recording: (1839/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1840/ 9621) 
 Hmm 

Recording: (1841/ 9621) 
 I'll start asking you questions. 

Recording: (1842/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (1843/ 9621) 
 Meanwhile, I stay in Columbus with Dad. 

Recording: (1844/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Except for a year and a half I lived in Russia, but that's different. 

Recording: (1845/ 9621) 
 Some of them just look like, you know, Cracker Back Box houses that, you know, they put up in a week or something. It's amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there's 50 homes. Because there's a lot of growth in Hilliard. Hilliard's, that's starting to scare us actually a little bit because now they just built another whole high school. Two whole high schools, I think. They were up to 2 or 3,000 senior graduates last year. 

Recording: (1846/ 9621) 
 And that was strictly no-no. 

Recording: (1847/ 9621) 
 It was more fun without being on. 

Recording: (1848/ 9621) 
 Then when you started to talk about homosexuality, it would be easier to, it would be easier for the kids to see that they're just people, you know. 

Recording: (1849/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (1850/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1851/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1852/ 9621) 
 I had French in the sixth grade and I got A's. I had German and Spanish in the seventh grade. And then in the eighth grade, I had French. In the ninth grade, I had French. In the tenth grade, I had French. And my junior year of high school, I had French. And my grades went B's, straight B's, C's, straight C's, D's, straight D's. And I said, I think I should get out now. And I stopped taking it. I didn didn't take French my senior year But then the arts and sciences came around and said you will have a foreign language requirement I'm like, well, I already know all this French. I might as well take some more French and a first-year freshman year of French Yeah, it was not fun. My second year sophomore. I started in for another year of French and about three quarters away through the year I realized that every day was all about dreading French class before and after. I would spend all up to French class going, no, no French class! And all after French class going, God, that was so miserable. I was like, this is stupid. This is no way to live my life. So I went to my counselor and I said, no French class. That's how it's going to be. So you need to figure out how I'm not going to end up taking French. Well, you have to take a French class. You have to. She was like, no, don't have to take a French class. 

Recording: (1853/ 9621) 
 Right. Like magazines. 

Recording: (1854/ 9621) 
 Is that right? They're not interested in seeing the sides or seeing the, well maybe they are, but it's like as a secondary agenda. 

Recording: (1855/ 9621) 
 Our janitor is worthless. Basically, we were complaining about it earlier during the year. Three formal complaints have been filed against him, and he still refuses to change the bleach water more than once a week. It's just really disgusting. So we had these temps come in one day, and we were in shock. It was so clean. 

Recording: (1856/ 9621) 
 I got a friend of mine that graduated from Purdue University of Indiana or something like that. I think that's what it was. I said, PU, PU University. 

Recording: (1857/ 9621) 
 But since all the moms have gone to work and let the TV become the electronic babysitter, and the other thing that's happening is kids do not know things now that you'd expect them to know, like, because their moms aren't reading to them. Like, they don't know who Winnie the Pooh is. 

Recording: (1858/ 9621) 
 And I was glad I realized that nobody would ever mess with my children, not even their father, my husband, or whatever. 

Recording: (1859/ 9621) 
 Everybody gets something. 

Recording: (1860/ 9621) 
 one of my kids got it for me. 

Recording: (1861/ 9621) 
 And they're also talking about, because the actors, the reason they're ending it is because the actors don't want to do it. There was talk, I don't know if they're still pursuing this, that they'd have new characters take over the roles. And I mean, the character development is the most important part, I think. So I think that'll be a failure. But that also sort of tells me that they're going to leave things kind of open. 

Recording: (1862/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1863/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, as far as the siblings go, Bernie does charitable work. 

Recording: (1864/ 9621) 
 So he took your good for your bad. 

Recording: (1865/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (1866/ 9621) 
 Neither was I. I really wasn't. And it's funny I just this summer went to my 25th high school reunion. 

Recording: (1867/ 9621) 
 We kept together in a zoo actually. 

Recording: (1868/ 9621) 
 It's a Catholic school. 

Recording: (1869/ 9621) 
 You know that was like the coolest. We would ride the bus. We lived right around here on 16th Avenue. 

Recording: (1870/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (1871/ 9621) 
 The net has changed it. 

Recording: (1872/ 9621) 
 And then they're going to say they want to nail their parents. Their parents are sitting at home. They have no idea what that kid's doing. 

Recording: (1873/ 9621) 
 They're nice, but. 

Recording: (1874/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (1875/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's what I said today. I said I'm the 1% that's unemployed right now. 

Recording: (1876/ 9621) 
 And you can say, well, that's how that makes you feel when someone goes, hey, we're having ham. I hate ham. The other night I had ham, and I threw up, and my mom made me eat it, and I threw up all over the floor. And I'm like, don't you ever do that when you're at someone else's house. 

Recording: (1877/ 9621) 
 No, he doesn't have a problem with it at all. 

Recording: (1878/ 9621) 
 You want my name now? 

Recording: (1879/ 9621) 
 Sure. I grew up in Lima, Ohio, which is only about an hour and a half from here, north. I came here in 1991, I believe, here being Columbus. I got married about three years ago. And right now I'm in the process of doing a little bit of everything. I've worked all my life until about the past two years. And I've just been working like part time and doing crafts crafts and things like that because I've always been like in the financial analytical end and the other side of my brain wants some work 

Recording: (1880/ 9621) 
 hopefully. 

Recording: (1881/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1882/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1883/ 9621) 
 inadequate. But that was even through nursing school. I mean, those weren't things that were discussed. You go to special conferences to get information on that. 

Recording: (1884/ 9621) 
 It used to be you lived in a little neighborhood, you knew all your neighbors. You don't have that now, everybody's mobile. 

Recording: (1885/ 9621) 
 Edward IV. 

Recording: (1886/ 9621) 
 that kind of thing. 

Recording: (1887/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1888/ 9621) 
 Oh! 

Recording: (1889/ 9621) 
 And I got about maybe three miles down the road and a cop pulls up just searing rain. 

Recording: (1890/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1891/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't know. That's one you stay away from. 

Recording: (1892/ 9621) 
 You know, it's like when I was out in California, like they'd spit on you. 

Recording: (1893/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (1894/ 9621) 
 Double A major. 

Recording: (1895/ 9621) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (1896/ 9621) 
 So I mean, it's not like there aren't young kids still there. I mean, and she does stuff like lots of things with school. You know, she runs all the school candy sales and she does like lots of PTA. She's PTA president. She also likes to remodel houses. So if there's a house that comes up, she'll buy it and fix it up. And, you know, she makes, you know, $20,000 a year on the side doing that. She likes to do it. 

Recording: (1897/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, he does back down too often, I think. Well, the health insurance didn't have a chance. I mean, no matter what position he took on the health insurance trying to radically change things, it wasn't going to get through Congress. And so, yeah, he backed down, but I would have liked to have seen something else happen to it. But it was also, I mean, he gave up because it was useless to fight it. It wasn't going to get through Congress, so why spin your wheels on that? I mean, he raised the issue. It was clear that it wasn't going to go anywhere. And maybe it'll, I think it's regrettable it hasn't come back. Yeah, but he's pretty much out of the picture now. As of this week. The gays in the military, they've always been there. Really. They've always been there. I don't have problems being around gays. I never have. I have a brother-in-law who's gay. My son's godfather is gay. It's not a problem. 

Recording: (1898/ 9621) 
 but 

Recording: (1899/ 9621) 
 But other ones, you have to take the full major. Some people are doing, gosh, I think one's doing business and one's doing economics. 

Recording: (1900/ 9621) 
 Casino. 

Recording: (1901/ 9621) 
 We want to serve you. They didn't get that at all. They were like, ooh. Some people would just be like, no, no way. That doesn't make sense. 

Recording: (1902/ 9621) 
 I'm trying to come up with a game works, trying to figure out how this game works, and then I said, I've got some information on this game out in the car, I'm gonna go get it. Chris, you keep playing, I'll be right back. Downstairs, out the front door, I see my sister on the couch, go out in the car, get the stuff out of the car, and look up and there are two police officers coming towards me. 

Recording: (1903/ 9621) 
 Yeah. So where were you out of overseas? 

Recording: (1904/ 9621) 
 But I've never been to Happy Valley, I've always wanted to go and I heard it's so nice. And you know, they're such good people, every time they come here to Ohio State though, they were very high class people. That year that we just killed them here, I think it was three years ago, but they were, you know, they just seemed very gracious. 

Recording: (1905/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1906/ 9621) 
 really smart. Bill Clinton is smart and I don't like Clinton but he's really smart. And Gore seems to be really smart. Bradley seems to be smart. And McCain maybe not so smart but he's smart enough. He's an experienced politician too. But you know Gore you just kind of look at that and say well you know the Republicans are desperate you know. 

Recording: (1907/ 9621) 
 What's really weird is I go to my mom's neighborhood and you'll still see kids playing out there in the schoolyard playing baseball. Now I got a schoolyard right next to me, you come up there and you see no kids doing it. 

Recording: (1908/ 9621) 
 well, you watch the movie, and you're like, 

Recording: (1909/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1910/ 9621) 
 Basically, you know, we used to be able to go to the woods and everything else now You don't even see merry-go-rounds on the playground because people would sue over it. Yeah, no offense people are ridiculous 

Recording: (1911/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (1912/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (1913/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1914/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (1915/ 9621) 
 Yeah, anger. It's always anger. 

Recording: (1916/ 9621) 
 Нормально. 

Recording: (1917/ 9621) 
 So he'd been burned front and back. He was in the hospital burn ward for, I don't know, two or three weeks. And it was the year that, one of the years that Ohio State played in the Rose Bowl. Now, that's the nearest I can identify at the time. But during the time that he was there, a girl who he'd been going with just occasionally, not real steady, was there to see him every day. 

Recording: (1918/ 9621) 
 Well, not really much of the answering the phones and stuff. It was more of my employees that I worked with. It was just pretty much I worked with adults that act like we were in high school and it was groupie, you know. And I'm not like that. I try to get along with everybody and it was just I never ended up fitting in with everybody and just things were gossip and I don't go for that. And I ended up quitting that job and I felt like I, you know, should have stuck in there. But I couldn't deal with it anymore. I mean, I'd go home and, you know, want to cry. I mean, it's just, these were all adults older than me. And it was just, it was really silly. 

Recording: (1919/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1920/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1921/ 9621) 
 to put into it. 

Recording: (1922/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1923/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1924/ 9621) 
 Uhhhhhh 

Recording: (1925/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (1926/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1927/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (1928/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1929/ 9621) 
 So Coleman, you know, you had a good record. 

Recording: (1930/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1931/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. That'll solve the problem. 

Recording: (1932/ 9621) 
 Well, one would hope that there would be enough education on the subject that the kids wouldn't think it was that odd. 

Recording: (1933/ 9621) 
 There was pregnant girls in middle school. 

Recording: (1934/ 9621) 
 Then when we leave, his eyes are itching. 

Recording: (1935/ 9621) 
 No kidding. 

Recording: (1936/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think they'll be very helpful. I was going to OSU to deliver the baby, so I decided to take the classes there. And basically, my mom had reminded me over and over again, Sarah, you need to schedule your MOSS classes. So I called OSU, and I scheduled them. 

Recording: (1937/ 9621) 
 and the real meaning behind it. 

Recording: (1938/ 9621) 
 it's not that bad kids offense it's just busy for a while and it's like not busy at later at night uh... so you can just talk to certain students and that's good 

Recording: (1939/ 9621) 
 But there's a couple places that are just way out in the middle of nowhere and you have to take a four-wheel drive to get there. 

Recording: (1940/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1941/ 9621) 
 It's been a while since they were close. days ago, seven and a half games back from the Chicago White Sox. We watched the game yesterday and I don't know if we have a lot of injuries or anything because I don't really follow the Indians, but I didn't even recognize that many of the names. 

Recording: (1942/ 9621) 
 And this is my consent to let you use that. 

Recording: (1943/ 9621) 
 She is, she's adorable. How old is she in this picture? 

Recording: (1944/ 9621) 
 See people now all of a sudden there's a rash of fires. You read that in the news and people keep doing it. I think society as a whole has gotten a lot more violent, which made the kids more violent. 

Recording: (1945/ 9621) 
 뭐야 얘 

Recording: (1946/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1947/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (1948/ 9621) 
 We had draft notices at the time, so I got a draft notice and enlisted. Yeah. 

Recording: (1949/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (1950/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (1951/ 9621) 
 So all over Columbus, they're all booked. 

Recording: (1952/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1953/ 9621) 
 Grandview has its own school system too. 

Recording: (1954/ 9621) 
 I have to get a job and support myself, so. 

Recording: (1955/ 9621) 
 years. 

Recording: (1956/ 9621) 
 So it brings that down and it's like, you know, they're not comparing it fairly. If you would take all the people who are making the same score on the test at both schools, I'll bet you they're all about the same. 

Recording: (1957/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. 

Recording: (1958/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we did. We had a, they're called LAN parties. They're parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook them up to, into a network and then you play games. 

Recording: (1959/ 9621) 
 Predominantly I like I like playing I like puzzles. I like challenges. I don't like to accept puzzles I like anything that involves fixing it I Don't mind breaking things either because then you have something to fix afterwards made me a very bad latchkey child 

Recording: (1960/ 9621) 
 Well, he wasn't really diagnosed then until just the last couple years. And part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed ADHD and it wasn't really, there weren't really good screening instruments for it. There are now. And we've often felt that he needed to have gifted, emphasis for gifted children. And the schools wouldn't do that for him because his grades weren't good enough because he didn't do the work. 

Recording: (1961/ 9621) 
 He's a businessman. 

Recording: (1962/ 9621) 
 Tennessee, they're even friendlier in some places. 

Recording: (1963/ 9621) 
 we want to clean or anything, they would probably say, you know, they might think it was kind of weird, but they would let you, you know, but they would be like, you want to do this and we don't have any money to pay you. Oh, but we don't, you know, we don't want money. That's the whole point. We're 

Recording: (1964/ 9621) 
 OK, dripping down. 

Recording: (1965/ 9621) 
 I think they're doing different things, like different people in the program. But I kind of decided to take the easy route. 

Recording: (1966/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1967/ 9621) 
 She figures, well, you know, that kind of makes up for me not working.

 Okay. And always made choices for himself. But as far as motivated for school now, he's always motivated toward a career. Yeah, he grew up here. 

Recording: (1969/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (1970/ 9621) 
 That's good. 

Recording: (1971/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm 

Recording: (1972/ 9621) 
 The mall, I don't even, like north of the mall I wish would stay because I mean it's close to where I live. I've been going there all my life, since I was born probably. 

Recording: (1973/ 9621) 
 Not necessarily, but you know, I'd like him to be the candidate. 

Recording: (1974/ 9621) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (1975/ 9621) 
 Even if my kids not there, they'll stop by my house just to say hi. 

Recording: (1976/ 9621) 
 trying to think of the name of it, but he usually gets his tickets for that game. 

Recording: (1977/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1978/ 9621) 
 That's a vestibule. Does your animal eat those? My animal eats mostly vestibules. 

Recording: (1979/ 9621) 
 and have the two daughters. 

Recording: (1980/ 9621) 
 And they were in Italy and Europe. And there wasn't the definite enemy in Vietnam that there was in Europe. I think that's part of it. And of course, the attitude of most of the guys that went to Vietnam was a little bit different from where I was, probably as a consequence of our understanding of the 

Recording: (1981/ 9621) 
 Maybe it's crime is going down in the sense that it's applying, you know, it's criminals aren't as active, but there's more and more of these acts of violence. And maybe it's because they're so dramatic. Did you notice it? 

Recording: (1982/ 9621) 
 Not that I know of. None of the other sports teams were so inclined to, like, push their athletes to cut weight. 

Recording: (1983/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you gotta remember it was all swamps back when I was a kid. Like I said, I grew up down here. It was mostly farmlands when I grew up around here. 

Recording: (1984/ 9621) 
 It started on my neck and went down, but it was automatic. And I mean, they had to take me to the emergency room. I didn't know what it was until... 

Recording: (1985/ 9621) 
 Didja? 

Recording: (1986/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (1987/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (1988/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (1989/ 9621) 
 He's the one jelling in their house and he's the one cursing and causing all the ruckus. 

Recording: (1990/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1991/ 9621) 
 But it's parents that fight for the society and what's in your community. You know, the parents for each individual child, they have to all form together as a group and almost be parents to all these kids as a group. You know, it's not, you can be the best parent in the world at home and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they get in a group of kids where their parents, they don't even know where they are. It's the kids' responsibility to get and go to school. Maybe the mom and dad didn't even come home the night before, but there's all different kinds of situations. So I think it does start with the parents because they need to be aware of what all the kids are being shown and have access to. 

Recording: (1992/ 9621) 
 Oh yes! 

Recording: (1993/ 9621) 
 That's just, it's ridiculous. 

Recording: (1994/ 9621) 
 I think she'll end up coming here anyway. 

Recording: (1995/ 9621) 
 Yes, haven't they talked about that here actually? Have they talked about? 

Recording: (1996/ 9621) 
 Yeah. So, you know, I felt like, you know, the Polaris Mall would benefit Columbus and all the way around, you know. As far as, you know, what was going on with that Jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about Northland Mall and everything. I can understand, you know, the residents of Northland wanting their mall to remain, but I didn't feel like, you know, that had anything to do with Polaris being built. 

Recording: (1997/ 9621) 
 Um, 

Recording: (1998/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (1999/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, they all have, there's actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look. But it's just that there's little details that are different. 

Recording: (2000/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (2001/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (2002/ 9621) 
 I'd say of, I think the VVA generally sees on the average 5, 7, 10, something like that a day, and not all of them homeless. 

Recording: (2003/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2004/ 9621) 
 I think that there should be a mandatory, because you have it in big companies, you have mandatory sexual harassment tapes. And you learn, you teach the girls that it's not what they do, it's how they make you feel is constituted as your harassment there. And they're too afraid. And then besides that, there's crushes on, you can't fault the girls for having crushes and things like that. They're going through enough things as it is. 

Recording: (2005/ 9621) 
 almost the minority. It was a pretty even, it was a low income neighborhood. And when I was in seventh grade, I remember going home and saying, was everybody the same? And being told, well, of course they are. So I went to school and told everybody I was in love with Danny Flowers, who happened to be black. And I got called into the office, and they called in a social worker, and I was punished. I wasn't allowed to, I was grounded for the year. And they never called this kid in. Then I thought, this whole thing is so screwed up. What's wrong with these people? They kept saying that they wanted to save this nice white girl because I had so much potential and they weren't gonna let me throw my life away like this. It's bizarre. And so I was always, from that time on, I decided these people are all crazy. I'm never to be like that. And so I have a whole lot of different values from my family and it's real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger are willing to 

Recording: (2006/ 9621) 
 Aww, that's nice. 

Recording: (2007/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (2008/ 9621) 
 Yes, it's definitely having an effect on children and the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it, but they aren't doing it yet. Whether they will be able to pick up enough by changing the way they teach and so on in the next 20 years, I don't know. But I'm glad my children went to school when they did and I stayed home with them. 

Recording: (2009/ 9621) 
 Super. 

Recording: (2010/ 9621) 
 Yeah, if it's a nice day on the weekends, I... 

Recording: (2011/ 9621) 
 Check this out. And then he'll let go and fall on his butt. It's kind of funny. 

Recording: (2012/ 9621) 
 There's like people calling and talk about other like they saw it in this other our mail-order catalog that I've never heard of either It's I don't know how really they do it like it's just like they get people's names and stuff from credit card Companies and then mail them out things and people call back or whatever 

Recording: (2013/ 9621) 
 somewhat. 

Recording: (2014/ 9621) 
 like, you know. 

Recording: (2015/ 9621) 
 Jetzt geht Ron rein. 

Recording: (2016/ 9621) 
 laughs 

Recording: (2017/ 9621) 
 what his background really was. 

Recording: (2018/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I graduated from Athens High School, enrolled in the OU for the winter quarter and pursued a part of that. 

Recording: (2019/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was very hard for me to stay in school. I could have easily quit like that because the teachers didn't, I went to a Columbus public school and they didn't care. I mean, I went through elementary and middle school with straight As and Bs and got there and I was on Cs to Ds, you know, and it just was really, the teachers didn't care, you know. If you learn, you learn. If you don't, you don't. If you don't come to school, you don't come to school you don't they don't care That was how my school was so I'm There what I don't there was nothing there that really I can remember that Did anything good for me? I mean, I think middle school taught me a lot more than high school 

Recording: (2020/ 9621) 
 There not as many of them or you mean because. 

Recording: (2021/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (2022/ 9621) 
 And she's taken very good care of herself. She's followed all the doctor's orders, and she's very careful what she eats. 

Recording: (2023/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2024/ 9621) 
 I live up north around Carl and Morse Road. 

Recording: (2025/ 9621) 
 Heh. 

Recording: (2026/ 9621) 
 but it's not gonna work. I mean, if you're around people, I mean, number one, they're around their parents and their siblings, and that's socialization. You go to church or to the library or wherever, I mean, you're around people and you're around children and they get to have socialization, if you wanna call it whatever. And I think from everything that I've read and seen that they get the socialization that they need at home and they're not relying so much on their peers and their peers opinions. Because I for one example the Pokemon craze. My son didn't know what Pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it. And you know, it's just like stuff like that. It's just like they don't, they don't know what half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face, you know? And then even still, they're just like, oh, it's cool because everybody else likes it. They don't really know what it is or what it's about. I mean, you know what I mean? Because it's like they just blow up each other or whatever. It's like, really, what is the point to the whole thing? And he didn't know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it. Oh, he must be cool because some other kids are talking about it. But then he decided that it wasn't cool. So that was my influence, our influence on him rather than the peers influence on him. 

Recording: (2027/ 9621) 
 It's Grace Brethren Christian Middle School. It's part of Worthington School. It's because they annexed it. 

Recording: (2028/ 9621) 
 I get a BS which they mail to me after first year of medical school. They figure that gross anatomy and all that's enough. 

Recording: (2029/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that seems good. 

Recording: (2030/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. 

Recording: (2031/ 9621) 
 uh... i don't know 

Recording: (2032/ 9621) 
 He seemed to confuse parenting with controlling. 

Recording: (2033/ 9621) 
 so I'm not going to get too much of an attitude from people. 

Recording: (2034/ 9621) 
 I think it's important to know what the person's values and customs are and to support whatever it is. I mean, we've done some wild things over there, but I mean, we've changed rooms around, beds around, positions of how beds needed to be placed in order that they needed to face the North Star or they needed to have this thing above the bed or under the bed. I mean, if it's important for them to have prayer, then I think it's important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to have whatever it is they need. 

Recording: (2035/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2036/ 9621) 
 and I don't really think it's something that needs to be taught. The only thing probably is like, what do they call that, cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take, I think. That I don't think is such a bad idea because just because you grew up in, I don't know what I grew up in, but I'll give an example I didn't grow up in. Let's say somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music. Doesn't mean if somebody doesn't do that, they're not okay. I think that would be a good idea. Or you know, cultures are all different. So if you wanted to view that as a culture or, do you know what I mean? That that is something different. Except the people, you don't have to like what they're doing, but they're still people. 

Recording: (2037/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2038/ 9621) 
 Heh heh. 

Recording: (2039/ 9621) 
 Do you? See, I don't care at all about tr- I don't even drive. 

Recording: (2040/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2041/ 9621) 
 And I would just hear things. 

Recording: (2042/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't think it's really alternative. 

Recording: (2043/ 9621) 
 She was alleging that students were writing racial slurs on their desks and stuff. But I had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any. 

Recording: (2044/ 9621) 
 I figure that would be plenty. I told my mom I just want green jello. She said you didn't make me snacks. 

Recording: (2045/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2046/ 9621) 
 and you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there. Now, in Port Columbus, you couldn't do that. But you could over there, because you can walk around on the ramp over there at OSU. 

Recording: (2047/ 9621) 
 Yeah, see. 

Recording: (2048/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2049/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think because my dad was. 

Recording: (2050/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (2051/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (2052/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2053/ 9621) 
 Yeah, no, that'd be neat. I'd love to do that. 

Recording: (2054/ 9621) 
 She doesn't have to be wearing that tight outfit. I think that's for ratings. I really do think it's for ratings. 

Recording: (2055/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (2056/ 9621) 
 where it's not weird, it's just a family. 

Recording: (2057/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (2058/ 9621) 
 So I don't know whether he had a boat or anyway there was a boat available to him and he rode across the island. 

Recording: (2059/ 9621) 
 That's certainly possible. There are lots of ways that my brain doesn't work the ways that other people's do So I think I think a lot of it too has to do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing You know, I mean I've gotten so much better over the years. I was very I've always been real a Lot more temperamental. We always joke, you know that that predictable and some of those things are not Even temperate or not things you would use to describe me, but not in a negative way, you know. I just think that as I've gotten older, too, I've been able to see things and not be so, get so concerned about things that really weren't that important anymore. 

Recording: (2060/ 9621) 
 16 years old, mom and dad split up. 

Recording: (2061/ 9621) 
 And I realized that, so it was like, okay, I'm not gonna do it for me, but I'm gonna do it for the future, and that helped. 

Recording: (2062/ 9621) 
 your little clicks. It's like being back in high school. 

Recording: (2063/ 9621) 
 kill. 

Recording: (2064/ 9621) 
 Oh boy. That kind of speaks poorly about us, huh? 

Recording: (2065/ 9621) 
 We had a thing I read a book about him a season on the brink where he had a bad couple years there and everything, you know And he'd bring the guys in you know, it's a term say now if you want to be a pansy There down there is where the football team is, you know 

Recording: (2066/ 9621) 
 Reader's Digest used to write their digest on the eighth grade level. They now write it on the sixth grade level. Newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level. For the general public, it's just either we're getting more and more LD kids that aren't learning to read or kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that, well, I read one article that said that because kids sit in front of a television set from the time they're born until they're five, when they come to kindergarten, they don't want to participate. They want to sit back and be entertained. And they're expecting you to do all this stuff, and they're just going to watch. 

Recording: (2067/ 9621) 
 just over summer and I use the A-pass and then I drive my dad down on Fridays. 

Recording: (2068/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2069/ 9621) 
 So... 

Recording: (2070/ 9621) 
 I'm just gonna sit down like this. 

Recording: (2071/ 9621) 
 Okay, let's go. 

Recording: (2072/ 9621) 
 break it off because I didn't think that was fair. I think anymore though with the women are more powerful and I think they they're finally making you know good money and used to be women needed men to take care of them and they weren't as much in the workforce. You know I think things have changed really in the last 10 years. You know in the 80s still yes. You know there was definitely a point in my life where I was like oh am I ever gonna meet anybody and all my friends honestly most of them were all married but I enjoyed being single and I never really felt the urge just to get married to get married and I'm glad of that. 

Recording: (2073/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I was ready. Oh yeah. 

Recording: (2074/ 9621) 
 the two-parter last season where it was they advertised as full disclosure. 

Recording: (2075/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (2076/ 9621) 
 It, I don't know, makes our generation sound like heroes. 

Recording: (2077/ 9621) 
 But you guys, the thing is just you have all these people and you got to keep their attention for like an hour or two. 

Recording: (2078/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's true. I had Janssen, and I, you know, that was, of course, I went to art school, so Janssen was just, in case you had to look something up, it was there. Our lecturers were all pretty liberal, so that, you know, the art history we got was different than what would just be in Janssen, so I never thought about that, but... 

Recording: (2079/ 9621) 
 We're not sure. We're looking to, we rent now and we're looking to buy a house. 

Recording: (2080/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we're getting impatient and we're getting, it's sort of like, you know, the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually. Maybe 30 years from now, there'll be, kids will be, you know, in this country will be learning more than they ever have. But right now, I think we're really not doing justice to the curriculum. And I say to my friends, I say, teach these kids well because they're going to be running the country in our old age. We'll be sitting in a rocking chair and they'll be running the country so you better teach them well. When you look at it like that. 

Recording: (2081/ 9621) 
 So I don't know where to go. To me, the biggest thing would be if they get rid of these Saturday night special guns and stuff like that. 

Recording: (2082/ 9621) 
 what should be done. 

Recording: (2083/ 9621) 
 No, we haven't. You know, there's always that fear. But we haven't. 

Recording: (2084/ 9621) 
 You did, I. 

Recording: (2085/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2086/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2087/ 9621) 
 Okay, okay. 

Recording: (2088/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (2089/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right. First of all, they're not really in love with you. And secondly, you're wrong. So when I came here, I didn't date. 

Recording: (2090/ 9621) 
 Um, oh. 

Recording: (2091/ 9621) 
 What I like best about it is when you're out in the middle of... 

Recording: (2092/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2093/ 9621) 
 It has this little bridge that goes up to the front door and a creek. It's cool. 

Recording: (2094/ 9621) 
 And some of the teachers actually had the right to search your bags and book bags. I mean, when it gets to that, then, yeah, there's been teachers that actually pull students aside if they know they're troublemakers and say, well, you can't come down here and go to your locker at this time or whatever. 

Recording: (2095/ 9621) 
 six years ago. 

Recording: (2096/ 9621) 
 Like politically? Well, like I was in high school, I was involved in a democratic campaign and just stuff like that. I'd like to do something, I'm learning more about the environment because of this job, but I'd like to do something otherwise. A lot of business leaders, they become very conservative when they get higher up because the tax breaks, they want to support things like that But I think there should be a good mix like there could still be like a think-tank of of Executives that could be very liberal and they're thinking and just you know for social for social not so much social change But you know not not encouraging sweatshops within their corporations stuff like that And I'd like to get I don't know how I would get involved in something like that but I would like to. It would be interesting. 

Recording: (2097/ 9621) 
 I do. 

Recording: (2098/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2099/ 9621) 
 because you know you're trying to run and your dog's trying to greet that dog and the dog's tripping you and you're like I've actually been known to go, am I the only one following the rules around here? Because I'm trying to run and obviously it's hard for me to run. 

Recording: (2100/ 9621) 
 Would you describe her as being a very forceful person? Were you ever in a relationship with someone who was are you more the decision maker now? some places simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we'll spend a good half hour 45 minutes just driving around till we actually decide a place or someone says something or whatever so 

Recording: (2101/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and it's a challenge living on one income. That's why I've got a part-time job now. 

Recording: (2102/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2103/ 9621) 
 We don't necessarily overcome bed by bed. We're still very much in that framework of reference on this particular planet. 

Recording: (2104/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2105/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2106/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2107/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well actually I do silk screening for t-shirts for my, like, for, like on the side for myself, like to generate income. And then also as of Monday, I'm working at Ohio. It's an environmental group. I'll be doing canvassing type stuff, just basically going door to door, sign this petition. 

Recording: (2108/ 9621) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (2109/ 9621) 
 There's no concept behind it. You're right, you're right. To some degree, the area commissions are supposed to work on that and help unify. I used to be on the university area commission in the campus area. And that's one of the things we work on, although some of the other commissions in Columbus are almost strictly architectural. They only talk about the kinds of buildings people can build. And in the University Area Commission, we dealt with that. We dealt with zoning, whether something would be commercial or multi-family residence. We dealt with parking. Yeah, a lot. Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (2110/ 9621) 
 You hitting on me? Get the hell away. 

Recording: (2111/ 9621) 
 It was difficult. I can't tell you how many times he had papers or projects due at school that we just have to sit there with him to keep him focused on doing it. One of the diagnoses is probably ADHD, which he has trouble with a working memory on how to get a project done and stuff like that. We taught him how to do timelines and Gantt charts and things like that. But it was very difficult for him to be task-oriented. 

Recording: (2112/ 9621) 
 It was fantastic. 

Recording: (2113/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. Unless, you know, his dad was totally gone. But he's been there ever since, you know, I was pregnant, all through my pregnancy, and he's been there for this whole two years. I wouldn't do that to him. 

Recording: (2114/ 9621) 
 You know, and that worked out well. But I think too, like with my school schedule, you know, if I'm just in class maybe, you know, three, four days a week, and then the rest of the time in the evening Jason will be there. So it's not like I'm relying on her every single day all the time to do that. And I really wouldn't want to put my child in daycare. 

Recording: (2115/ 9621) 
 And they seem like random or just spontaneous. There's nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except hide. Hide in your basement or something. 

Recording: (2116/ 9621) 
 I love it. 

Recording: (2117/ 9621) 
 and obviously a lot more dangerous. I definitely think that there is a bigger problem with the bigger drugs once you get it to college or whatever. 

Recording: (2118/ 9621) 
 Exactly. Sydney, you know, Germany, Spain. 

Recording: (2119/ 9621) 
 Well, I work in the county department. I'm an accounting assistant. 

Recording: (2120/ 9621) 
 Oh, because some of the newer jets, there's like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner. I mean, it's there are prop planes that are like five times as noisy. 

Recording: (2121/ 9621) 
 I do believe that in some cases the parents or the responsible adult should be found guilty of that. 

Recording: (2122/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2123/ 9621) 
 And I'm going to hold you to this confidentiality because very few people know about this. 

Recording: (2124/ 9621) 
 You know, whatever's going on, I always have to have a backup plan though. And then I know, well, if this happens, this will work. And if this doesn't happen this way, then this is what we'll do instead.

 in the US. 

Recording: (2126/ 9621) 
 I said, well, it didn't spell vestibules wrong, but I doubt if your animal eats parts of buildings. 

Recording: (2127/ 9621) 
 I just couldn't see doing that. And I had enough to worry about and think about while I was trying to teach a class. Keep everything else straight and also mark down if people are participating. That was tough. I ended up not doing it. 

Recording: (2128/ 9621) 
 I'm kind of mad at my team at the moment 

Recording: (2129/ 9621) 
 Besides the issue of children, what would it bother you if gay people were to get I've had, you know, that they more or less took care of each other, you know, so. 

Recording: (2130/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

 and putting the street lights they have at Easton.

 At that point I get to activate my URL pass.

 But I was I was interested in seeing Coleman be elected. Yes. Because she's a Republican. I used to work with.

 Absentee a number of years ago when we were traveling a lot and everything else I we did absentee voting and I've just kept it up Now one year I forgot to send it in so I went to the polls 

Recording: (2136/ 9621) 
 Yeah, parents are very into this. My sister has no idea where she wants to go, but they took me around all the different colleges to be sure what I wanted. Interesting. Go to OSU. 

Recording: (2137/ 9621) 
 That was horrible. 

Recording: (2138/ 9621) 
 because it was also a nice like 100 is such a pretty round number. 

Recording: (2139/ 9621) 
 Okay, my parents are still married. I'm from, I lived there all my life. I was born here in Columbus, so I really haven't known anything else. I have a dog named Sammy. I work in the dorms as a night assistant, and I have a girlfriend right now. 

Recording: (2140/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2141/ 9621) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (2142/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're all really nice. 

Recording: (2143/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2144/ 9621) 
 you've got to have the leadership, you've got to have the right people to have this school structured properly, and the people with the right credentials for the job. And I'm telling you, some of these principals that I've dealt with were highly overpaid as far as I was concerned for what they were doing. One principal from my daughter's high school, he was out partying all the time. He was riding around in a Corvette and he tried to take me out. 

Recording: (2145/ 9621) 
 Crazy. 

Recording: (2146/ 9621) 
 coals like the blacksmiths or whatever you know. 

Recording: (2147/ 9621) 
 I'm on my ninth manager. 

Recording: (2148/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2149/ 9621) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (2150/ 9621) 
 The population is much different, yes. 

Recording: (2151/ 9621) 
 And her husband worked for a testing company that does testing with—I don't know very much about it, I probably shouldn't even say—but with ultrasound equipment. 

Recording: (2152/ 9621) 
 the

 If you know what I mean. But I had no pistols at my house. I had shotguns and rifles. Now to me a lot of these pistols like a 25 caliber. Come on there's no use for a gun like that. 

Recording: (2154/ 9621) 
 30, 40,000. It's international. Yeah. 

Recording: (2155/ 9621) 
 Well, I felt that, you know, Polaris Mall would be good for the city, even though I want, you know, Northland Mall to stay there. That would seem to be the big issue, you know, with Northland Mall. 

Recording: (2156/ 9621) 
 I think that basically that's in a nutshell they've reached a point in their life where you know they're cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or smoking you know whatever you know smoking crack or whatever and then just living in the hell I mean 

Recording: (2157/ 9621) 
 You're warming up. 

Recording: (2158/ 9621) 
 I think so. I think so. If you're willing, you know, anybody who's willing to put out the effort. I mean, you do have to, you know, you have to sell yourself. There's, you know, you're not going to just sit around and wait to be discovered. But if you put out the effort, I really don't, I don't think there's that kind of, that kind of discrimination anymore. 

Recording: (2159/ 9621) 
 Well my husband was allergic when we first got together but I have to admit he has other allergies so he gets shots and things but they always say it's the pet dander 

Recording: (2160/ 9621) 
 you know, with the computer and everything. He's a really good handyman. He can do anything, so he's really helped me. He's really into design and stuff, so he likes to paint, and, you know, he's really open. He's learned a lot about gardening from me, and, you know, that's one of my main things is gardening. 

Recording: (2161/ 9621) 
 We try and teach and expand people's knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about Christ, they don't have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something. Somebody asks them something and they're like, I don't know. Or they actually have an answer. And if they don't know, they'll say, I don't know, but I can find out for you if you're willing to if you're willing to give me the time to go find out. I don't know the hardest 

Recording: (2162/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2163/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they got me one time for cutting zero period and the principal's was having me sit in the office during zero period to serve detention So if you could tell me how they can get me for cutting class when they ordered me to sit in the principal's office I could figure that one out, too 

Recording: (2164/ 9621) 
 Deafness, for example, and blindness are not always genetic. They don't know why. They just know that it shows up more in boys than girls. This year I have 16 students and I don't have one girl. In fact, I haven't had any girls for a couple of years. I usually have one or two girls and all the rest boys. 

Recording: (2165/ 9621) 
 I mean, I don't know enough about it to really say, but I can't. I mean, I don't know where they got that. 

Recording: (2166/ 9621) 
 Faucet Center, so it's not even really on campus. Yeah. 

Recording: (2167/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2168/ 9621) 
 Is that right? Especially if they're Americans. 

Recording: (2169/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2170/ 9621) 
 I've learned a lot. It's been interesting. I've liked my classes.

 No.

 She has already been to Europe twice, sadly, and has accumulated all of 34 points.

 back in the early 70s. And then I transferred to Worthington in 76, and I've been there ever since. 

Recording: (2174/ 9621) 
 Her husband is, believe it or not, they're not really, I wouldn't call them neat freaks, but we tease them because my parents and her live within a couple miles of each other in Dublin, and you have to take off your shoes when you go in, which is really, it's amazing how good their carpet looks. 

Recording: (2175/ 9621) 
 If you cared that much about keeping your own, well, there's the kids ready to be adopted. 

Recording: (2176/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2177/ 9621) 
 No, math is just, you can say, okay, here's three blocks, you can touch them. One, two, three, take two away, now there's one. I mean... 

Recording: (2178/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2179/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (2180/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2181/ 9621) 
 Is it hard for you to teach him as well as take care of the younger child? minor thing. And I feel like I'm just in a kind of a phase, if you will. It's, you know, because there will be grown up in a blink of an eye. So if I, I mean, if I put my career or whatever on hold, it's going to be worth it in the long run when my kids are grown up and they can be like, yeah, mom was there. they taught, mom and dad taught us all of our life application skills that we need to know now and I think that that'll be better in the long run for them. And that's the responsibility I took on as being a parent, so that's my job. Even though it is mundane and monotonous at times, 

Recording: (2182/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, there wasn't even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it. There was nothing there. There was no ability to communicate. He needs to know this piece of information. At the same time, there's no way I could tell it to him. So yeah. So I'm, yeah, you don't know. And there was nothing else to do about it. And continue on merrily. And he said, eventually, he said, it was sometime later when I actually found out what was going on. I said, I had some suspicions. Because you can do a quick party count and figure out who's not there and assume something bad has happened. But he said, but it was a while before I found out actually. So we can stop the story here. We can go on because the story, it's a fun story. 

Recording: (2183/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's how he gets so much money. He says, I will be paid this much and I will be given this much minimum per day or I'm not working for you. And they usually say, no, no, no, we won't do that. And then they'll call back a week later. OK, we'll take you. He has some really good stories about that. Oh, yeah. So what, he just has qualifications with running businesses? Is that why? He has qualifications with businesses and also with Unix, which is 

Recording: (2184/ 9621) 
 There are some good athletes, especially on the west coast like Stanford. I have a friend who is from California. 

Recording: (2185/ 9621) 
 I could do all kinds of stuff, you know? 

Recording: (2186/ 9621) 
 Something in his schedule interfered with it 

Recording: (2187/ 9621) 
 I mean, I'm used to this boy like, you know, jumping all over the house. 

Recording: (2188/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, you know, signing, oh, here you go, hon. The one, I think, is pretty obvious that the blind eye was something that shouldn't have happened. The other one, that, yeah, you just, let's face it, at that age and at every age, we want a leader. And I guess it goes back, if we choose to, or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves, we'll make better decisions of who's going to lead us. So I don't know. I think a lot of it's the family unit breaking down in general, you know. And secondly, I think to be honest, I think the media has gotten a little carried away. They sensationalize it. And I do think, you know, they know they're gonna get recognized. They're gonna have their name go down in history. Unfortunately, I think that has something to do with it too. It's frustrating to turn on the news. They don't really cover, my husband comes from a journalistic background and he'll be like, that's not news. You know it's just we get so let's sit here and watch a plane crash for 12 hours instead of watching I don't know what Little House on the Prairie I don't know I'm being facetious but you know what I mean 

Recording: (2189/ 9621) 
 and they're not a real high mountain, but a mountain. And in the front of it, there was a little kind of a dip. 

Recording: (2190/ 9621) 
 and you know about what time of the year he's coming. 

Recording: (2191/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm.

 That's a full-time job. 

Recording: (2193/ 9621) 
 Muldaurn. 

Recording: (2194/ 9621) 
 There seems to be an awful lot of publicizing of some of it. I mean, it's pretty dramatic. A woman setting fire to somebody. What happened in Columbine. It's very dramatic, but what happened in Columbine, that was all that was on the news for a whole day. It seemed like anywhere you looked, that's where it was. This thing's coming loose a little there. I mean, that's all you could see, and it was like, well, how much do you, how much new is there to say from minute to minute on every channel? How much do people really need to keep hearing it? 

Recording: (2195/ 9621) 
 It was mostly Caucasian and very few Asian and other ethnicities. 

Recording: (2196/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2197/ 9621) 
 car accident I'd say about 10 years ago. 

Recording: (2198/ 9621) 
 Yes, yes. And that's, I'm geared towards, you know, people with mental illness, you know, they've diagnosed me with bipolar, but, you know, my neurologist says the bipolar was just a chemical imbalance as a result of the brain injury. Spiritual leaders have told me that it's a spiritual imbalance. There's really no chemical thing there. The problem is both physical, mental, and spiritual, but the majority of the problem is spiritual. And when you talk to people that know that, 

Recording: (2199/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2200/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2201/ 9621) 
 But. 

Recording: (2202/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there's no distinction. 

Recording: (2203/ 9621) 
 I think 

Recording: (2204/ 9621) 
 I think so, although she was working at her desk most of the time so that she didn't give them as much attention as 

Recording: (2205/ 9621) 
 There's a tradition. You see, now you're looking for reasons. That's looking for science. 

Recording: (2206/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2207/ 9621) 
 They put them so close, these huge homes, and then there's 10 feet between them, and everybody sits in their little backyard with their fence around it and looks at each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's nothing. We looked at some of those, and the wife's like, there's no way we're buying these. You feel like you're in Florida or something. 

Recording: (2208/ 9621) 
 And they've always, they have to go, I guess it's not a congregational church. It's more ruled by the, it's like a, it's not a diocese, but it's more ruled by the convention and the convention tells you where to go. 

Recording: (2209/ 9621) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (2210/ 9621) 
 Right, yeah, that would be fun. 

Recording: (2211/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (2212/ 9621) 
 That's what I recall missing. 

Recording: (2213/ 9621) 
 So that was like through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that.

 meet kids that kids like. 

Recording: (2215/ 9621) 
 Whoa. 

Recording: (2216/ 9621) 
 Not really. I'm more into more beat-oriented music. I go to so-called raves or whatever. I'm really into that type of music. I haven't really played music in a while because I'm starting to get back into it, just doing different things. 

Recording: (2217/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2218/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2219/ 9621) 
 No, over on Beulah. You know where that, over by North Broadway, where I said.

 Diversity. 

Recording: (2225/ 9621) 
 Why can't they fake ours to make it easier for us to understand? But usually there's no problem. The only problem you usually have is somebody like yourself who has never flown and is taking lessons. And you have about 10 or 15 hours, and we tell you to do something, and you're like, well, I think I know what they mean, so I'll just keep flying. And it's the worst thing you can do. The best thing to do is say, OK, I heard what you said, but I'm brand new at this, and I've got no idea what you mean, can you try it again? And they'll go, OK, now we know where you're coming from. And they'll make it really easy for you. Because if they just zoom out some phraseology, and you go, 9-8 Juliet, which is how you respond with the call sign of your airplane, 

Recording: (2226/ 9621) 
 Okay. I bet I'll go home and I'll wonder and wonder and wonder about this. 

Recording: (2227/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (2228/ 9621) 
 That's ridiculous. That's amazing to me. 

Recording: (2229/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (2230/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we've done some at Strait. So when I was younger, we used to my dad and I would ride our bikes down here. And it was kind of, I said, I'm going to go to the University of Hawaii, but that never happened. I kind of stayed. 

Recording: (2231/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. It is it's it's American from the fact that it's it was written by Native Americans and and and Joseph Smith was an American and he was used to to translate it So it is that it's actually funny though, but there's more members of the church that live outside of America 

Recording: (2232/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2233/ 9621) 
 Just throw that into being sure you're relaxed enough. 

Recording: (2234/ 9621) 
 Not really a national system. It's already been put to national if they rate them state to state and city to city. But on the level of the actual needs of the student, you can't just put down a book and say, I want you to put 500 words on this page why you like this or dislike this book. I mean one person can do it and another one I mean you could probably write about a thousand words on a page right now about psychology because of your how many years you have? Two? Three? 

Recording: (2235/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2236/ 9621) 
 Not for the train. 

Recording: (2237/ 9621) 
 and they would have made it so I wouldn't have had to make the decision. I mean, that was a hard decision to make. 

Recording: (2238/ 9621) 
 Yeah, the voice, the signature, the fingerprints. People have their own style of doing things. I myself like watching football, fishing, working on stuff. 

Recording: (2239/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (2240/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2241/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because I... 

Recording: (2242/ 9621) 
 If he wants to, yeah, anybody's capable of changing if they want to. 

Recording: (2243/ 9621) 
 NCR paper, so when you write on the white copy it comes through on to the yellow copy and at the end of the period the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend. So he didn't have to write, if he wasn't getting the notes 

Recording: (2244/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2245/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I work on the auction up there. So I sort of avoid the main campus. It's been a long time since I've been around here. 

Recording: (2246/ 9621) 
 Except you couldn't come right out and say you didn't want to vote for her because she was a woman. There'd have to be an undercurrent. 

Recording: (2247/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2248/ 9621) 
 then busing them to a half a day kindergarten and busing them to a daycare that's near their school. So we might as well do all day, plenty of time. They get a nap, they get fed and all that. So I've been really happy with the daycare there. 

Recording: (2249/ 9621) 
 Well, I have different options. I'm thinking I could either be an art teacher or have some kind of freelance type thing for my home. And I really want to just hurry up, get done with school as fast as I can. My husband and so we don't want to, yeah, we don't want to wait very much longer. Some of the classes I'm taking are probably kind of dangerous though, like the fumes from the paints and stuff. So I can't, have to wait until those are over. 

Recording: (2250/ 9621) 
 And then. 

Recording: (2251/ 9621) 
 So when they built the continent up on 161 it was almost all gay. German village was almost all gay at one time. Yeah, there's a big gay, you got what, about 20 gay bars probably here in Columbus alone. 

Recording: (2252/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2253/ 9621) 
 No, I personally don't because I seen maybe not to the degree of the violence, but I still do it with violence. Stuff when I was a kid, that didn't make me a violent person. 

Recording: (2254/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, and to a certain extent, everybody gets the same upbringing through mass media and, well, malls. 

Recording: (2255/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2256/ 9621) 
 XD 

Recording: (2257/ 9621) 
 Ugh. 

Recording: (2258/ 9621) 
 that ran down, oh, 100, 200 yards from the gun position. So we took off down there. 

Recording: (2259/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't know. 

Recording: (2260/ 9621) 
 Let's put it this way, if your kids are in my yard doing something and I yelled at them, you're liable to come down to my house and either shoot me, sue me, or have me locked up, right? 

Recording: (2261/ 9621) 
 I think, I don't know, I think it's the combination plus I think the dressing is my sister's recipe for dressing. And it's a balsamic vinegar dressing with olive oil and garlic. It's just a real good dressing. I tend to use that most times. And everything being chilled, just nicely chilled and all that sort of thing. 

Recording: (2262/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2263/ 9621) 
 I think they might have tried to any help, but obviously they wouldn't have been as good at it or you know what I'm trying to say wouldn't have been as much distraction because obviously the bombs is something but to actually have that right there I mean have the access and whatnot I mean I guess the grandparents had the house locked and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew that use them and that scares me 

Recording: (2264/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2265/ 9621) 
 I think he specializes in like Solaris and HPUX. 

Recording: (2266/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (2267/ 9621) 
 I said, well, God has a sense of humor. That's what I said. So I don't think the saga is over. 

Recording: (2268/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2269/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (2270/ 9621) 
 And he went to Columbus Alternative, which is considered one of the top high schools in the state. He was asked to leave. He was in a psych ward for a while. In some ways, he seemed to have gotten it together. He's working full time at United Dairy Farmers. He's involved with, very much involved with having a baby in another month Well, not not really. She's only 16 and he's 19 She quit high school at the end of ninth grade within a few months had her GED is filling out forms now to start go to college in the fall In becoming an engineering Tech She's looking at two or three different areas. I'm not sure which. She can't convince him to, he says he needs to have a GED, but he hasn't done anything about it. We've always had the feeling he had a fear of failing, because he was so good at anything that he really wanted to do, that the areas that he was not good at, math for instance is an example, he just got very frustrated with and just wouldn't try. He's very talented. He's had artwork published, poetry published. He's won, he won a statewide award, a gold medal for bagpipe playing. 

Recording: (2271/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, sort of. 

Recording: (2272/ 9621) 
 That's why you always hear about the BB gun. 

Recording: (2273/ 9621) 
 In high school, yeah, I was friends with most of them. 

Recording: (2274/ 9621) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (2275/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2276/ 9621) 
 He's still in Columbus. He's like some sort of business. I don't understand business whatsoever. Yeah, that's all I know. It's lost on me. I'm sorry. I don't have a finance head. 

Recording: (2277/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2278/ 9621) 
 I said, what? She goes, well, I don't talk. I won't talk to you about stuff like that. I said, why? I'm your dad, for God's sake. She goes, well, that's something that I talk to mom about, but I wouldn't talk to you about it. I said, well, that's cool. But I just wanted to let you know that I do know women who go through that stuff. 

Recording: (2279/ 9621) 
 Well, but. 

Recording: (2280/ 9621) 
 Or you say something to a kid about three blind mice. 

Recording: (2281/ 9621) 
 me. 

Recording: (2282/ 9621) 
 All the politicians, all right, take the governor or take the president of the United States. They can want something this way, but then they've got the Senate and all these other committees down below them that if they overrule him, what good does he, you know, what can he do really? So, I mean, no matter what he promises, and you're voting him in there for what he's promising you, but if he can't succeed in getting these other guys to back him up, there they went. 

Recording: (2283/ 9621) 
 period and it's a long process. I mean this has been going on for 200 years this way. And people are suspicious of government asking questions. 

Recording: (2284/ 9621) 
 I don't know, I wouldn't personally think that the parent should be held responsible. I mean, they do have a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should have been more aware, and especially because, I mean, I believe that those, at least one of the two, had been in counseling and was doing aggression management or something like that. You would think that if they were going through something like that, you would just sort of, you know, maybe keep a closer eye on what they were doing. So I think, you know, to that degree, you know, the parents should have, you know, were sort of responsible. And also with like their kids disposition, I mean, you know, would you not notice some difference if something like that was going to happen? I mean, depending on, you know, how well they hit it or whatever. But I think at that point, though, you're, you're so influenced by your peers. 

Recording: (2285/ 9621) 
 So I became a proud business major. 

Recording: (2286/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2287/ 9621) 
 casting off authority and that kind of stuff. It was about someone making a bad choice, gaining power because of it, and then ultimately seeing the folly of the ways and dying in the classic tragic hero sort of way. And so I'm looking forward to how they build up to that point. A lot of people when I was in high school, they're like, what the hell are you talking about, Beau? But yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing how things come about. 

Recording: (2288/ 9621) 
 must have 

Recording: (2289/ 9621) 
 I mean, it's a lot better than it was even a year ago. 

Recording: (2290/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2291/ 9621) 
 to preach. And they were always in places like Washington State and Louisiana and Tennessee and Idaho and Oregon. Just everywhere. But it made it interesting to visit them. 

Recording: (2292/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2293/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2294/ 9621) 
 As a teacher, how could you cut down on students and say, no, that's not the way it was? And you're learning from the teacher's guide? No. But how do you know without asking the person? But it's a matter of tradition and handing it down to the tradition itself. It's a matter of having in your family, what did your parents think of this way and that way? And it's not necessarily written down, but it's passed on in those days, probably written down, or not written not written down but verbal and extended and so it's that hand down from generations 

Recording: (2295/ 9621) 
 I'm living here all my life. I don't like it. I like the old cow town. They can call it what they want. It was easy to get around. You never had any traffic. You don't sit on the freeway like you do now. Now it's like you don't want to go out at four o'clock. You just don't want to get involved in it. So I don't know. Growth is good, but I guess I'm not into it as much as a lot of other people. It's good for the economy, but it's just amazing all the, every time you turn around, they're plopping two, 400 home unit developments up here and there. I'm just thinking, where are these people all coming from? You just can't imagine. Where'd these people all move from? This is getting scary. Yeah, what's the big draw? You know And you know you still see you know when they opened up a Lone Star steak near our house They couldn't even do lunch because they didn't have the people I think so, you know that it's people are just dying for people to work out there 

Recording: (2296/ 9621) 
 of 

Recording: (2297/ 9621) 
 So basically there's no way, you know, unless you have a steel cabinet to put that gun in. And there we go. The rich can afford that, but the poor can't. 

Recording: (2298/ 9621) 
 yeah well it's just a you know grilled cheese omelet you know make it like grilled cheese except omelet and cheese and all your goodies inside you know got a little secret recipe to throwing a little bit of this and that in too. tastes pretty good too 

Recording: (2299/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2300/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, yep. 

Recording: (2301/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2302/ 9621) 
 ferme. 

Recording: (2303/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2304/ 9621) 
 they were. 

Recording: (2305/ 9621) 
 stayed here, so. 

Recording: (2306/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2307/ 9621) 
 Definitely, so my daughter definitely, because she was working for Camp Scruxavit Christ. And she came home one weekend from Oxford and 

Recording: (2308/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2309/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2310/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they do. I think it's something like 60%. 

Recording: (2311/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2312/ 9621) 
 I think they need to educate me on what's important to them and I'll honor and respect as much as I can. But even people within different, I mean a Catholic isn't a Catholic in my opinion. I mean there's some old time Catholics, I my mom, that are very strict Catholics, by the old rules before the Vatican. I think there's a new modern age of Catholics. So even if you say, I'm Jewish, or I'm gay, or I'm African American, or whatever, I varying, they're still a person with different needs and wants and what their traditions and culture and family values are are still going to be very different. And you need to find out from that individual person what it is that they need. 

Recording: (2313/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there's a girl at the store I was talking to and she saw how I wrote my signature. If you look right there, she asked if I was a doctor. 

Recording: (2314/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2315/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (2316/ 9621) 
 They want to stay in the room, I know. I don't know, but I would know there was something going on. 

Recording: (2317/ 9621) 
 You have to do something like it's more of a this big procession to do anything you have to put on like all these coats were more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like go to the park and sit and it's fine but like here you know you get slush everywhere and you got to think of something to do you just can't like drive around and waste time because it's because it's miserable 

Recording: (2318/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2319/ 9621) 
 what I'm doing. 

Recording: (2320/ 9621) 
 Or she doesn't know about all of them, you know? Like, she found out about the ADH just like we all, you know, and I guess like a couple of the kids in the class had it, or on it, you know? And she's like, oh, what's that? And she's like, oh, I have to figure out that stuff, you know? She called one of the caseworkers and figured out the whole program, and she come in and told another girl about it. She told me about it. 

Recording: (2321/ 9621) 
 And they have different art classes and different speech and language classes, different levels of science. And it's kind of like a college campus. 

Recording: (2322/ 9621) 
 of all the off-campus kids to the police. And so they start driving around around 10.30 to try and bust them for noise on the weekends. So it's pretty hectic. 

Recording: (2323/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2324/ 9621) 
 bride. 

Recording: (2325/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (2326/ 9621) 
 That, yeah, we went to a thing there, they were talking about that, that you gotta figure out what the baby boomers are moving into and invest into those type of things, you know. 

Recording: (2327/ 9621) 
 That's fun and that's a challenging age too, 13 months, that's fun. 

Recording: (2328/ 9621) 
 Oh, you're just a homemaker. 

Recording: (2329/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2330/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2331/ 9621) 
 Yes and no. I mean as far as the experience goes I mean I don't live on campus so I don't get the entire college experience you know the whole dorms and events going place on campus. It's more things that I pick and choose that I want to do on campus I come down for. So I can't really say it's anything too drastic. I mean obviously it's kind of weird when people are asking what you're doing and you're like oh I'm going to high school prom or. Do you think, there's a lot of people that say that in today's youth, they watch so much TV and listen to all this violent music and they play these violent video games like Doom or whatever. 

Recording: (2332/ 9621) 
 But... 

Recording: (2333/ 9621) 
 I mean he wanted us to be together, he wanted us to have a house, he wanted to have my kid have his last name and I was like, are you crazy? This child is somebody else's kid, not yours. And he didn't like that, he loved my son. And we're still good friends and he still comes and sees my son but I couldn't. 

Recording: (2334/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and in the eighth grade, he took the ninth grade proficiency test and passed all four parts the first time. So he was learning what they were teaching, which that's another problem, teaching to a test, but that's a whole different problem. 

Recording: (2335/ 9621) 
 I'll just keep them as friends. That works. 

Recording: (2336/ 9621) 
 You know, it was, while they totally embraced the culture and all the stores and everything like that, and the food, you know, the fast food or whatever, they hate it at the same time because it's ruining, you know, and I had a lot of friends from elsewhere in, you know, Western Europe, and, you know, they just were, and I was quite surprised, actually, because when I first went there, I had worked on an island, previous, I mean, Mackinac Island, you know, sort of just north of Michigan, but, and I'd met some English people there, and it was, you know, there, all the Americans were like, oh, English people, your accent is so neat, and all that kind of thing, and then when I went there, you know, and this was actually one of my friends, but I remember, you know, she was German, and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things, and then she sort of looked at me, and she said, like, oh, actually, I shouldn't be asking you. I don't want to learn the American way to say those. Like, I want to learn the British way. And people would say things all the time. And it was, you know, they'd ask you what your background was. And if you'd say, well, I'm American, they said, well, you know, like, where are your ancestors from or whatever. And then you would tell them. And then, you know, on the same turn, they would just sort of like snigger and be like, oh, you're not whatever of this European thing. You're, you know, sort of. 

Recording: (2337/ 9621) 
 Now, now, there's a few townie bars, but couch students are real welcome there. 

Recording: (2338/ 9621) 
 Programs like that they were good down-home programs that taught good values to the children But now they put some of those stupid. I can't even understand them Some of the comedies that they supposedly have on with these funny characters and everything else They don't look like anybody we see walking around this earth. Why do they have them on there? 

Recording: (2339/ 9621) 
 crummy new apartment buildings, you know, sloppily constructed. Yes, yeah. 

Recording: (2340/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2341/ 9621) 
 My brother knows about it and my mother and that's the only ones in my family that are even aware of it. Because we just don't want to be bothered with all the questions. 

Recording: (2342/ 9621) 
 I'm sure it probably will. 

Recording: (2343/ 9621) 
 I was the receptionist. 

Recording: (2344/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2345/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2346/ 9621) 
 and i mean those are legal obviously obviously things like once you start getting into cocaine, pcp, things like that those are a little bit more serious 

Recording: (2347/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2348/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2349/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2350/ 9621) 
 So, where a man, you know, you kind of feel like he can carry his own weight, you know, a woman, you may not, you may feel like you have to do a special thing in order to keep her from getting killed, you know, or something, or shot or something. So, I wouldn't personally like that myself. But I had no problem with him being like a pilot or something like that, you know. 

Recording: (2351/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2352/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2353/ 9621) 
 Just watched it and uh... You know, they lost yesterday. 

Recording: (2354/ 9621) 
 I think that's bullshit. 

Recording: (2355/ 9621) 
 So it's a good money maker. 

Recording: (2356/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right here in Columbus, in the short north. 

Recording: (2357/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (2358/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2359/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that is one of the... 

Recording: (2360/ 9621) 
 Well, as far as the racism issue, first, they showed some figures on the news and actually it was like more 

Recording: (2361/ 9621) 
 is a 

Recording: (2362/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Well, you had a good reason to be bothered. 

Recording: (2363/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (2364/ 9621) 
 And there are some people that deserve to be fired. And there's no way that you can really differentiate just because they're in a union. 

Recording: (2365/ 9621) 
 No, he didn't either. He joined when he was 16 and he was Catholic before. Similar, just kind of thing with him. 

Recording: (2366/ 9621) 
 I like everything about architecture. That's actually what I do as a job right now. I'm building things. I'm adding on a bedroom and a bathroom. 

Recording: (2367/ 9621) 
 My sister had gone a couple times and basically took me aside and I have but one sibling and it's fun to have a sibling because nobody is more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with the inanity that is your family. 

Recording: (2368/ 9621) 
 Um, it didn't seem that much stranger than anyone else. 

Recording: (2369/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2370/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (2371/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (2372/ 9621) 
 You just can't get away from it, can you? 

Recording: (2373/ 9621) 
 Let me ask you this, where's the nearest teen club? There is none. Where's the nearest playground? There is none. Where's the nearest sports center? There is none. So basically, there's not a whole lot to do except for to hang out. So yeah, I think society as a whole is more violent. The kids are more violent. Look at the news you see on TV every day. You see people getting mad just because they're sitting in traffic. 

Recording: (2374/ 9621) 
 He thought it was great that I was going to school, but... 

Recording: (2375/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my grandfather's dead and my grandma's still alive now. She loves my son. 

Recording: (2376/ 9621) 
 God's in that, you know. Even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off in the wintertime, God's in that steam. A lot of people can't understand that. But, so the laws of thermodynamics say that it's impossible for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can't be heated to an adequate point of withholding heat. 

Recording: (2377/ 9621) 
 And he always said, well, I'm so allergic. But then he didn't have any problems. 

Recording: (2378/ 9621) 
 I don't know, do it incrementally. Like, you know, like, like, like, do like, like, hear a recitation and then kind of like work your way up. 

Recording: (2379/ 9621) 
 They didn't make it into the history books, yeah. 

Recording: (2380/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2381/ 9621) 
 uh... case western you're not from around here are you? 

Recording: (2382/ 9621) 
 38 Derringer, you know. 

Recording: (2383/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (2384/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2385/ 9621) 
 It's around Morse Road. 

Recording: (2386/ 9621) 
 My daughter's a schoolteacher, has been teaching for, I don't know, ever since she got her degree. 

Recording: (2387/ 9621) 
 But I really enjoy them. 

Recording: (2388/ 9621) 
 I can't really take her with you. Yeah, you can't get her in. You have to be 18 to get into dance clubs now. But those are the two really, really, really tough ones that a lot of people will throw at you when you're trying to share things with them. But there's whole lists of them. And it's just a matter of, I mean, I am getting myself to a point where I can go out and share my faith with other people. I don't think I'm ready to because one of the biggest problems is like I mentioned with the Brother Jed thing is undoing the damage other people have done. And I don't have enough knowledge up here to really go out and be like a campus preacher. I will share my faith with people that I'm really close to, like co-employees and other people that I'm in. If somebody gets real close to me in a class, eventually I'll share with them. But if I'm in a lecture hall, I'm not gonna jump up and start hollering about my faith. Do you think there's a place and a time for doing certain things. This is one of the biggest things that people use as a reason for faith. Faith is something that people don't understand. I don't even understand it. I use it as an answer for a lot of questions that I don't have answers for. It's faith. And that's what religion is. Religion is faith. Every religion has to have faith. You have to believe that what you're doing and what you're believing in is right. You know, whether everyone else in the world thinks it is or not, you have to believe it is, or you being part of that religion has absolutely no meaning. And that's an answer that a lot of people don't like to hear. And, you know, like, I've walked down, like, High Street before, and gotten this urge, this feeling to just share my faith with certain people on the sidewalks. Like, I shared my faith a little while ago with some street bums, and they were real receptive. I don't know if they were drunk, but they were real receptive. I don't know if they really understood what I was saying, but I felt led to talk to them, and that's what I believe my faith is. My faith is faith. It's believing that things happen that you can't explain. It's believing that you're doing what you're doing is right. So, religion's a real big part of my life. 

Recording: (2389/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2390/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (2391/ 9621) 
 Which made it a little inconvenient when he lived in the twin towers in the dorm. Because if I needed him to come home or something, you know, well, I don't know if I got to get to my car some kind of way, you know. 

Recording: (2392/ 9621) 
 Well, my question is, who's more important on the basketball team? The five starters or the six men coming off the bench? I ask you, who? Ask George Reese. Is he less important this year than he was last year? 

Recording: (2393/ 9621) 
 People want a number. They don't want to know the methodology that goes into it or the disclaimers or the footnotes. They don't want to read the footnotes. They want a number. When I worked for the state, one program I worked on was Occupational Employment Statistics, which was collecting numbers of employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas of Ohio, which actually originally started here at the University of Ohio. It was a federal program, Department of Labor. It was administered at the state level. And it didn't turn out very well, so they switched it over to me for a variety of reasons, which was not entirely the university's fault. They had to rely on confidential information, which we couldn't give them because it was confidential. By federal law, it was confidential. We couldn't give it to them, but they needed it. So it was just not a good way to do business. And we would present information. Okay, there's this number of people in an occupation, but there was also a range of error on there. Well, people wouldn't notice that. And they would take that number as gospel, and you just could not convince them that, well, it really means more than that. The big one would be wage levels. And we didn't really, at that time, collect wage data. So we were kind of a conduit for, there's several different departments in the state, in the federal government, that collect occupational data, and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that. People, they wanted an hourly rate, they didn't want a range, they wanted a number, and that was gospel. But it's based on survey data, and there's always statistical error in there and stuff. And try to explain that. We spent more time, when people call and give information, explaining, this is what this really means, than just giving them the number. We spent more time doing that. 

Recording: (2394/ 9621) 
 Convenient. 

Recording: (2395/ 9621) 
 Right, you gotta pick your battles, right. 

Recording: (2396/ 9621) 
 Maybe I you know I Cuz I was you know I was fooling around too when I got in ninth grade and I Don't know I didn't wear any condoms or do anything like that, and I just am very lucky for never getting pregnant 

Recording: (2397/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (2398/ 9621) 
 I have a daughter at OU. I know that's a bad word for you guys. 

Recording: (2399/ 9621) 
 They're normal people just outside of their sexual, well, majority of the people prefer heterosexual. 

Recording: (2400/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (2401/ 9621) 
 I can't really see a problem with it. But like I said, if he's going around picking fights, things like that, then I can't say I'd support anyone like that. 

Recording: (2402/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2403/ 9621) 
 Yeah, why not take advantage of this? Yeah, why not take advantage of that? 

Recording: (2404/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I had sold with it. Well, I waited I knew that what had to happen on the outside which is really only some paint a minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and cleaning up the front yard and then we have there's a guy who works for me who's I Just don't know how I can have how he makes a living because he's very very reasonable he's also very loyal to me he's done stuff for me for years and And he's not that old. He's probably 28 or 29 now, but anyhow Pat went in we added a bathroom There was a mudroom we added a half bath off the kitchen and we put in Change the back door and put in the deck and he did those kinds of things and you know And then we were ready to go and I said I was gonna sell it myself and everybody said I was crazy And I had an open house and I sold it that day I had 30 I had like 30 some people in I got my offer that afternoon. I got what I wanted. Well I didn't get it immediately. The realtors told me I should ask 134 and I asked 146 instead because I really felt I I knew that this was a nice house and I knew I had beautiful hardwood floors building bookcases and I just knew that I could have seen me wanting that house. And you know what I mean? It's like that identity thing. And so somebody came through with the realtor and they made me this offer that was real low. It was like $138. And the realtor, I'm thinking about it because it was funny, he delivered the offer to my home and I was gracious and I thanked him and I got inside and I opened up and I saw it. And I went running on the porch. I said, wait a minute, this is never gonna work. 

Recording: (2405/ 9621) 
 They will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances. Because even when we reduced deductions, it went down too. And then again, you say, well, maybe some affluent person would donate and it's publicized. 

Recording: (2406/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2407/ 9621) 
 Everybody's living longer, everybody's, there's more medical things where people get, can be healed from things that they couldn't be healed from. So everybody today is living basically as today is their future. Where back 30 years ago, I mean, when I was a kid, you know, I mean, I wasn't really thinking about today. I mean, I was thinking about tomorrow. 

Recording: (2408/ 9621) 
 And for just a poor little wife and a small baby on that was kind of tough going. 

Recording: (2409/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's a qualitative type analysis. 

Recording: (2410/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (2411/ 9621) 
 I didn't see that part. I missed that beginning. All I seen was the chart and I was like, whoa. That's one reason why I would hesitate to put my kid in the Columbus Public. Just like the daycare. 

Recording: (2412/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2413/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean you don't want to see the chain gangs with the people whipping them. I mean, that's not right either. But yeah, I'm not for the weight rooms because like they said, they come out and then they're stronger and they can do more damage. Yeah, and you're like, great, we paid for that, okay. So I think just to keep them busy, you know, even if they educate them, I've heard of people, you know, the education, I don't think it really hurt anybody. I'd say incorporate that with some education of some sort, you know. I mean, I don't want to go out in the sun and work for five hours or whatnot. Plus, they're doing something in return for free housing. Do you know what I mean? It's kind of a give and take there. 

Recording: (2414/ 9621) 
 But I think it should be an option. I'm really for women's rights and everything because I was single for so long. And I just feel if a man could have a child, it would be different. But since women are the only ones that can, then it ultimately should be our choice. I really do. And I think we should have every option available, especially when you're young. No girl should have to go through pregnancy and everything, even if it's a mistake or whatever. I just, you know, it ruins their lives when they don't have the option. 

Recording: (2415/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I will. Yeah, I will explain that to him. 

Recording: (2416/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2417/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (2418/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2419/ 9621) 
 Right. Yeah. 

Recording: (2420/ 9621) 
 Right. I mean, Powell is booming. And I think personally, I could not have put him in daycare when he was an infant. And I think I would have quit if a family would not have been available. But since family was available, and I think he's very social. I think he was ready for the interaction with the other kids. And three days a week isn't right. 

Recording: (2421/ 9621) 
 That's it! Bingo! 

Recording: (2422/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I took 104 during winter quarter. 

Recording: (2423/ 9621) 
 So it's like you have these two different camps, the camp that gets enthusiastic, and that's where I was. And then there's the other camp. And I'm sure they have their own hierarchy, their whole structure. And they do things their way. 

Recording: (2424/ 9621) 
 Well I'll make an analogy with your women. Who's more important? Who's saying that not being a priest is not important? Being your individual we're all called to be important. A priest is just an occupation, a part of that society out there. The President of the United States isn't any better off than you are. He shouldn't be. 

Recording: (2425/ 9621) 
 Uh, 

Recording: (2426/ 9621) 
 Yeah, real bad and it was, you know, mainly no one talked about it. 

Recording: (2427/ 9621) 
 I'd 

Recording: (2428/ 9621) 
 That's right. 

Recording: (2429/ 9621) 
 Whoa dude, look there's a tornado over there. And right at that time, a big old pine tree got pushed across, you know it's already been broken, but it just got nonchalantly pushed across the freeway. And he goes, that's not a tornado, that's fog man, it's too far away. I said, what? 

Recording: (2430/ 9621) 
 I was born in Los Angeles, California in the mid-50s. And when I was less than one year old, my family moved to Columbus. The first place we lived in Columbus was in Whitehall near the corner of Hamilton and. Then shortly after that, we moved out to Reynoldsburg. And I lived there until my sophomore year in high school. And during my sophomore year in high school, we moved to Worthington and I graduated from high school. I went to Oberlin College and then I graduated from there in 1976 and moved back to Columbus and did a variety of jobs in Columbus. Then I went to Ohio State University from 1983 to 91 and got a master's degree in geology. So I'm an alumnus. And after that I had another variety of jobs. But I've lived, and well, during that time, I guess I lived in the university area for a number of years. I lived on 16th Avenue near the fairgrounds. And let's see. Had a number of different jobs. Currently, I at Hilliard and I live in Worthington in the south part of Worthington. I'm renting a room from my mom. And I'm yes. And I sort of took a step backwards. And right now I'm saving up money and trying to buy a house somewhere. And it's I'm sort of kicking myself, wishing I would have done about 20 or 30 years ago, because it would have been a lot cheaper. Right, right. It wasn't a top priority for me then. Yeah. 

Recording: (2431/ 9621) 
 Huh? 

Recording: (2432/ 9621) 
 10 years, no question about it, that's it, you're in jail for 10 years. 18 years old, if you've got anything on, 10 years, that's it. And you look at some of these other people, like these sports people. 

Recording: (2433/ 9621) 
 We're getting more fun stuff all the time, but predominantly it's still got way too much cow town personality. 

Recording: (2434/ 9621) 
 So when he did that though, I mean, there's medication out there that can help people. Like I said, I don't want to see people with brain injury, with mental illness, or with any kind of disability use that as an excuse. 

Recording: (2435/ 9621) 
 Oh, 

Recording: (2436/ 9621) 
 Like pigeons. Okay. 

Recording: (2437/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (2438/ 9621) 
 You know, so you can use all those opportunities to show your kid what not to do. 

Recording: (2439/ 9621) 
 I mean, you don't know anything behind it or what's going into it. Why would you do something like that? 

Recording: (2440/ 9621) 
 She always says, Mom, it was fine. She said, I got to do a whole lot of things you won't let them do now, in exchange for that, now that I know better. She's always very generous about it, and says she had more time alone with me. I split with her dad when she was about a year and a half, and until she was six, it was just she and I. 

Recording: (2441/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2442/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2443/ 9621) 
 That's nice. 

Recording: (2444/ 9621) 
 North. 

Recording: (2445/ 9621) 
 She's a librarian at an elementary school one block from our house. 

Recording: (2446/ 9621) 
 You've heard of the Anjo Beachhead. We'll go up there and get around behind them. 

Recording: (2447/ 9621) 
 there's not a big established gallery system and everything. So a lot of things were just available, you know? You just could walk in and show anywhere. And so I met a lot of people doing that. I mean, I'm mainly friends with the same people I met then, artists my age. I don't belong to any formal groups in Columbus, but it's a real strong network of people. Everybody knows everybody. 

Recording: (2448/ 9621) 
 And research and stuff like that to do a lot of things that were done years ago 

Recording: (2449/ 9621) 
 Cooper, I just don't see him ever hugging the guys or saying great job or anything. 

Recording: (2450/ 9621) 
 Now I go. 

Recording: (2451/ 9621) 
 Think about things. I mean, it's pretty easy to do. 

Recording: (2452/ 9621) 
 Well, I agree that we should help them, maybe through some sort of government program. But I think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on High Street, because it really doesn't motivate them to get out of the gutter. I mean, if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students, they're probably going to stay with that, because it's a really easy life. 

Recording: (2453/ 9621) 
 About four or five years. That's not that bad. How old? Oh, that is very young, yeah. You don't want another one yet. You want at least diapers out of the way before you go to the next one. 

Recording: (2454/ 9621) 
 I think the point is they're on drugs, you know, and I don't, yeah, I'm not, I don't consider myself racist at all. It is unfortunate that that's what's happening, but it's just one of those things that you hate to say, yeah, I'm for it, because you sound like, it's like everything is specific, and permanent, yeah, I kind of have a problem with that, because they might change their mind, but then again, they can always adopt adopt. You know and I kind of look at it that way there's enough kids out there that need love and 

Recording: (2455/ 9621) 
 Gosh, you know, that's one of the things that I've really, you know, when I read the paper, I think, wow, what can you do? It has to start there first, you know, and I think if, and this might be because I'm a woman, but I think if women started running things, it would be a lot different than when men run things, because men tend to think, you know, like the government and that kind of thing, those kind of funds that are available for different organizations, they're all geared toward things that essentially help them as a whole or help... Well, yeah, but I mean not so much that. It's always been the women's responsibility to be responsible for the kids or to care about their well-being and a peaceful environment and all that kind of thing. Men are more, let's go get it, we need more money. 

Recording: (2456/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (2457/ 9621) 
 I'm sure, I'm sure it is. You know, it's just the circles I move in. 

Recording: (2458/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, you know, well you can see it here. I mean you See some 19 year old or 18 year old guy or girl or whatever, you know and See the difference in the maturity, you know of another couple of three different people and everything. I don't know whether Me coming from like a rural area, you know, I asked and everything I Think it maybe has something to do with that even to today, you know, you're more family-oriented Your friends are basically, you know, you count them on your hands what you still can but But you socialize a lot more if you're in the city with more people and everything. Where if you come from like a smaller town, you tend to socialize with a certain people, you know, group or whatever. 

Recording: (2459/ 9621) 
 I got thrown out of high school 

Recording: (2460/ 9621) 
 I mean, he's kind of in big trouble. They're wanting to pull the charter on him and everything. But he's going to try and keep the school open, which is going to be ridiculous. 

Recording: (2461/ 9621) 
 Yeah, four girls. 

Recording: (2462/ 9621) 
 right 

Recording: (2463/ 9621) 
 I love it. 

Recording: (2464/ 9621) 
 It ain't my job, I'm doing her work. She ain't. 

Recording: (2465/ 9621) 
 I don't agree with that at all. I think if your parents are unhappy together, only thing that's going to happen is it's going to trickle down and you're going to have to listen to them being miserable. And I think it's much more positive to have two families that are happy than one family that's miserable and they fight and then you feel like it's your, you know, people say it's my fault because this happened. And I think for me it was easier that they split up when I was younger than I can't imagine being a teenager and having my parents split up. I think that that would be probably very difficult. So I don't know. That's a totally different perspective, just to look at it from that point of view, just because I was a lot younger. 

Recording: (2466/ 9621) 
 Sniff. 

Recording: (2467/ 9621) 
 like while she was studying or something. I think we played this Homer Simpson song. She got so mad. It was so worth it. 

Recording: (2468/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2469/ 9621) 
 It might, it might. I was gonna say earlier, and I forgot to mention it, is that one of the best campaigns I've seen in recent years utilizing college-age students has been Clinton's campaign, both times. He knew he needed to get a base to increase his chances of winning the election, and did, especially in the first campaign, and I believe that was 92, did a really super job of organizing college students, because that's when you're at your most, when you believe in things and you're at your most idealistic, and you would think that kids would automatically be interested in something, and he was able to tap into that. In addition to that, and as an undercurrent, it wasn't overt in the Clinton campaign, but I know when I talk to people, and you have to be careful where you do this, because abortion is a very divisive issue in this country, and I think it does mobilize people, but it also divides them, definitively, almost like in Vietnam, almost like that war divided people. But I would tell many, many women that they had to vote for Clinton because it was the difference between protecting Roe versus Wade and not, and in protecting choice. And I'm starting to see that now even in the Gore campaign. I've seen a couple of editorials in the paper about the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three Supreme Court justices. And if you want to protect that right, you've got to vote with the candidate who's going to put the best justices on the Supreme Court. And I got a lot of people to vote for Clinton that way, both in 92 and again in 96. And I think that's going to happen again because the candidates, and I'm telling you my politics here very clearly and early, but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already. I know which one will protect the right for choice. And I think we need to protect that. So yes, I think it will, but I don't think it's an issue that if you did overtly and said, you know, support candidate A over candidate B because they'll protect abortion rights, that's going to divide the country and not keep us together. 

Recording: (2470/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2471/ 9621) 
 But it's really. 

Recording: (2472/ 9621) 
 I'm not real big on the denominations because I think that sort of goes against what the original intent of Christianity was. I mean, it was designed to be a unifying religion. And the denominations are just, I don't like them. 

Recording: (2473/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2474/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right, I taught, well I was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that I've been in. 

Recording: (2475/ 9621) 
 I'd say probably the black man. 

Recording: (2476/ 9621) 
 It's like where I work at. The only way I can get a raise is by being, like the kids used to say, a tattletale, squealer, whatever you want to call it. 

Recording: (2477/ 9621) 
 Growing up, my father had restaurants and a couple private clubs. So I was always interested in the food industry, but more so with planning of the parties and deciding what the clients' needs are. I really like working in that aspect with nice chefs and really creative food. It's nice because basically every job is usually different. I'm doing a function tonight for 300 people for the higher Republican Party and you know there's just needs for each thing that I do which makes it interesting. 

Recording: (2478/ 9621) 
 If you have to come back to this weather I would do I'd is it really 

Recording: (2479/ 9621) 
 But... 

Recording: (2480/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2481/ 9621) 
 Now we run an online system where people connect to our system and build databases or access the databases. Everything OSU has in their library collection is in our system. Their records came from us. Yeah, and we do that for tens of thousands of libraries. 

Recording: (2482/ 9621) 
 about it. 

Recording: (2483/ 9621) 
 Kind of yeah, actually with this case I do know what happened to the father, he ended up moving to Colorado. 

Recording: (2484/ 9621) 
 being here at the university. 

Recording: (2485/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2486/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else. I really don't understand that. Some people do it. 

Recording: (2487/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2488/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2489/ 9621) 
 But you don't really have to work as hard there apparently. 

Recording: (2490/ 9621) 
 I did get better grades last nine weeks, didn't I? Well, isn't that amazing? You were taking your pills then. Some connection here. So you kind of just have to sit them down and say, well, let's just go through some of the things that give you trouble. And we'll write them down and say, oh, well, last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all. This nine weeks, you haven't been able to focus on that. Maybe medicine does help you some. Maybe you're just not giving it credit. 

Recording: (2491/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. She went to school here till 91 actually so she was See about the fourth grade fifth grade 

Recording: (2492/ 9621) 
 to say, you know what, I'm sick of this, I'm going to shoot those people. 

Recording: (2493/ 9621) 
 As far as what he did, I'm sure that he probably did go to meetings. But as far as being a leader or something like that, I'm sure he wasn't. 

Recording: (2494/ 9621) 
 And I think they have a lot to do, you know, the parks and things like that. So I'll just hold it. But I like it because it has art and culture. And it doesn't feel like a big city. 

Recording: (2495/ 9621) 
 Most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions, but they're getting better. 

Recording: (2496/ 9621) 
 I don't think you do that here. 

Recording: (2497/ 9621) 
 when 

Recording: (2498/ 9621) 
 Really, you know, I agree. I mean, none of the above. You go, and I think a lot more people would certainly go out. They would vote for none of the above, and then we can have some more candidates. 

Recording: (2499/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I know. It's good one of us feels that way. 

Recording: (2500/ 9621) 
 And 

Recording: (2501/ 9621) 
 That was grade school. 

Recording: (2502/ 9621) 
 some really wacky 

Recording: (2503/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2504/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (2505/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2506/ 9621) 
 Obviously it's not something new that's been coming around. I mean, it's been around for a long time. 

Recording: (2507/ 9621) 
 There you go. 

Recording: (2508/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, what my opinion on our whole penal system is just, you know, well, it goes along with kind of neglecting the kids in our schools right now, and we're definitely neglecting criminals. They need to have, be educated and worked with. I mean, they need to, obviously, some place, some point, they've learned incorrect reasoning or whatever you call it and they need to, they need to have psychological help, period. 

Recording: (2509/ 9621) 
 but it didn't bother me. Religions, basically everybody, when I was in there back in the 60s, everybody was pretty much a Christian, you know, Christianity, either Catholic or something like that. But nowadays, you know, you have the more outspokenness on Muslims and Islam and Judaism and everything. And there again, I don't have a problem with that, you know, because you got to meet yourself. You know, you got to make your peace with your maker because, you know, if you believe in religion, you're here temporarily for an eternity later on, you know. 

Recording: (2510/ 9621) 
 who's been real helpful with being a support. My parents are very supportive. It was just sickening when I sat down there and the bidding started at $125,000 and actually they offered us $12,000 and my attorney looked at me and said, are you fucking nuts? I said, this guy had his head split open and it was your negligence. So, you know, we'll take that as an insult. 

Recording: (2511/ 9621) 
 to communicate with our neighbors. Like years ago, you knew everybody in town. Well, the town I grew up in was Summer Station. I don't know if you're that old teeny-weeny town or not, but it's not a very big town. And everybody knew everybody. 

Recording: (2512/ 9621) 
 I wish I knew the answer, but reality, I just feel sorry for the people that not only feel that they have to do that, but also for the people that are involved in it and the other, those victims and everything and their parents and everything. The only one I really had to, I was really upset with was the Columbine deal, and that was because the one kid was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents knew nothing about it or if they did they didn't even think anything about it and I don't think that behavior it's appropriate for a 16, 17 year old kid. 

Recording: (2513/ 9621) 
 because he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit people and I smacked his hands for that. I try not to yell but it's hard not to yell. I try to talk to him 

Recording: (2514/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, we're members of their. 

Recording: (2515/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2516/ 9621) 
 And he had been through a counseling experience before and he just played along with it then to get out of it I think. 

Recording: (2517/ 9621) 
 sure 

Recording: (2518/ 9621) 
 Nothing serious now. 

Recording: (2519/ 9621) 
 So, I mean, basically the entire winter I'd either be doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends. So, the whole reason I quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight. I was really starting to feel it physically. 

Recording: (2520/ 9621) 
 Okay, so our backbone is still there but ultimately as we get traffic measurements, we will be able to downsize the number of pipes we have, so streamlining our network. 

Recording: (2521/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2522/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2523/ 9621) 
 Whatever you want, sure. 

Recording: (2524/ 9621) 
 I'm sure. 

Recording: (2525/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2526/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (2527/ 9621) 
 and we stayed there for a while and then she met my stepdad when I was about six years old I think and then they moved up to Clintonville when I was about eight. Now my dad lives up in Clintonville too. 

Recording: (2528/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2529/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2530/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (2531/ 9621) 
 I, that's another thing that, that where I'm at odds with my parents, or that they don't understand the fact that why would I go to college? I paid for it myself. I worked my way through school. I was so proud of the fact that I was like only a quarter late than my actual schedule to graduate, which is pretty amazing given the fact that I was paying for it as I went. And I didn't have any loans. When I was done, it was paid for. And so, of course, tuition was $125 a quarter. But I was only making, you know, 50 cents an hour at the Beverly across the street on Neal Avenue. So, but anyhow, you know, they could never understand, you know, you never got a job with it. You know, why would you go to school and waste all that money? It was the best money I ever spent. 

Recording: (2532/ 9621) 
 You know, they're just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it'll be something a little more nationwide. But they really just wanted to start off with something easy. And they only take national merit scholars in there. 

Recording: (2533/ 9621) 
 Turn the music up, it's already blasting. 

Recording: (2534/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2535/ 9621) 
 And they fought a lot. There was a lot of violence. And then I love Walt Disney. I mean, all that stuff. They have beautiful music. But I swear I haven't seen a Walt Disney movie that doesn't have violence in it. 

Recording: (2536/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2537/ 9621) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (2538/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2539/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (2540/ 9621) 
 Work's gotta be easier than this. 

Recording: (2541/ 9621) 
 in the world. 

Recording: (2542/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly, exactly. 

Recording: (2543/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and just a couple things. I remember when I first started going to the Unitarian Church up here on, well, when I was in Sunday school, we drove there from Reynoldsburg by going up, I think, Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road up to Morse Road and then over on Morse Road to High Street. So it was on the back roads, you know. And that was before the mid-60s when the freeway was built, I-70 was built through town. And a lot of times you don't realize what kind of havoc that creates when a freeway is built through the middle of a town because you have to take out a lot of houses to do that. And you can sort of realize that if you ever go around the area and go to one of the little side streets that dead ends because the freeways there and see the side street continue on the other side and you think about there must have been 20 or 30 houses that they had to take out here. 

Recording: (2544/ 9621) 
 But they lived in a beautiful home. I mean kids like that I could see if they're poor in Harlem or whatever, but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in Colorado. I mean you know I just think they were removed from what their children, their son was doing. 

Recording: (2545/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (2546/ 9621) 
 So it's not a, there was a man named Sun Bear who was recruiting women, you know, and telling them they had to sweat naked. 

Recording: (2547/ 9621) 
 I mean I could practically graduate already, I have all the credits, but then you have those required classes that you have to take. 

Recording: (2548/ 9621) 
 I don't say that of all of the kids because I know that some of them were brought up right. 

Recording: (2549/ 9621) 
 My older sister was a different case. She was a little badder. But as long as you have a good parent, I think that's really all that matters. Because my mom was my mother and father. She did very well. 

Recording: (2550/ 9621) 
 It's Medicare type. 

Recording: (2551/ 9621) 
 Oh, wow. How'd you hook up with that? Or did it just happen? 

Recording: (2552/ 9621) 
 Yes, private homes and actually where I work there's not a facility. 

Recording: (2553/ 9621) 
 Go out. 

Recording: (2554/ 9621) 
 That's the only way I can get a raise over there where I work at. 

Recording: (2555/ 9621) 
 He was living with this one family for a while. And they were nudists and taking him to nudist camps and stuff like this. Wouldn't you think they would... They never had any contact with this. They just let him move in. Can you imagine letting your 14-year-old friend just move in and not find out why or anything? 

Recording: (2556/ 9621) 
 I mean, Colin Powell was pretty close, if he would have ran. 

Recording: (2557/ 9621) 
 Her house in India is like this mansion and they have servants there. I mean, it's really impressive. Just the houses are just worth more, so you can't get as much house here. But yeah, everybody's doing well. 

Recording: (2558/ 9621) 
 아이고, 아이고. 

Recording: (2559/ 9621) 
 We come to as many games as we can. We both golf and we like hiking, swimming. Every year we used to go on a trip. This year we went to New Mexico. We were thinking about moving out there. 

Recording: (2560/ 9621) 
 We develop a lot of software and projects and I consult on the database side. 

Recording: (2561/ 9621) 
 It's been good for my son. 

Recording: (2562/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2563/ 9621) 
 And you told me not to lose that, so I'm trying to stick to that. Sorry. 

Recording: (2564/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and the problem is seeing things in other people. I mean actually seeing spirits in other people in terms of someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul. That's very true. I can see in certain people's eyes when I was in the hospital, the confusion, the unsure feelings, you know, the, I don't know, just something I could see there that I can't explain, and I still can't explain it. I just know what I see and then I go and try and tell the psychologist or psychiatrist well they want to put me on some kind of anti-hallucinogenic medication and I said well listen man you know I'm not hallucinating 

Recording: (2565/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it wasn't. There we go. 

Recording: (2566/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (2567/ 9621) 
 By the eighth grade they are. Sixth and seventh graders pretty much know everything. And you're the stupid one. But by the time they get to eighth grade they're going, oh you're the best teacher, I can't believe I said that to you. 

Recording: (2568/ 9621) 
 Well, I think, in my opinion, I think mainly it's the absence of basically parenting, you know. My mom was there. She was a housewife, you know. And so she went to work after, I think, when I was a junior in high school, you know. And my brother, all my brothers and sisters are already graduated, you know. 

Recording: (2569/ 9621) 
 She went to my school. She just barely works at all apparently. 

Recording: (2570/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2571/ 9621) 
 No, I really just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around. 

Recording: (2572/ 9621) 
 You know you have to be a good example. I mean if you if you're just that for your kids then that's all they need. You know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but if you're taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the right things and I think that's the best you can do for them. 

Recording: (2573/ 9621) 
 So he gives them a drug called Welbutrin, which is a, you know, like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for ADHD. But it really helped him, you know, concentrate to be able to study. 

Recording: (2574/ 9621) 
 I am during different points of the day, I don't know. 

Recording: (2575/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2576/ 9621) 
 But it made a lot of people more rare. 

Recording: (2577/ 9621) 
 Well I think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes. You know a lot of the you know there's people with good intentions but I just think that it just needs to be restructured a totally different way and you know maybe pull these kids into more of a group setting or something and give them more you know counseling professional you know counseling. Is this you know I didn't have good experiences with foster homes and and I know of a lot of kids you know that are saying that I think the parents have too many rights you know in the courts and there's just a lot going on you know that it's not going to get better it's going to get worse. You know with the way families are torn apart now and you know mothers have to work and you just can't, you know, stay home and be that, you know, perfect mom, you know. So there's just a lot going on that needs to be restructured. So. 

Recording: (2578/ 9621) 
 Peace. 

Recording: (2579/ 9621) 
 I mean obviously if someone's like 30 and they're gay I don't see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time. 

Recording: (2580/ 9621) 
 If you weren't here, well, he was the first capital punishment case in Ohio in 20 or 25 years or something like that. And he'd killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed. And I thought that's a cop out if there ever was one just to give him a lethal injection and let him go. He should have rotted in prison for it. No, that's not a punishment. He was off his rocker. There isn't anybody who murders who isn't insane. 

Recording: (2581/ 9621) 
 And they went through their own training and everything. We didn't interface with each other or nothing like that. I mean, you might see one walking or marching somewhere, but as far as fraternizing, you weren't allowed to. 

Recording: (2582/ 9621) 
 It's so corrupt. They have two choices, to stay in it and try or to succumb to all the things. And 90% of them, as you can see what happens in Washington, have succumbed. I don't hear any of them raising hell about what really matters in this country. 

Recording: (2583/ 9621) 
 Okay? 

Recording: (2584/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2585/ 9621) 
 I don't really know honestly. I mean it's definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to him 

Recording: (2586/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2587/ 9621) 
 That's a little hard to accept. You know, it's hard to know what he's going through, how much of it is normal teenage rebellion and how much of it's just 

Recording: (2588/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2589/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, when he was, I don't remember how many months, it went on for like two months where he just cried. It might have been colic or whatever, but he just cried. And yeah. 

Recording: (2590/ 9621) 
 have 

Recording: (2591/ 9621) 
 And because of that, the athletic director that was here at the time, he quit because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him. 

Recording: (2592/ 9621) 
 And so I get a lot of you know what from my sisters. 

Recording: (2593/ 9621) 
 Oh well. 

Recording: (2594/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I was in the sales department through telephone marketing. It was actual sales that I was doing. I was there for 15 years. 

Recording: (2595/ 9621) 
 It's like a double scene. Like, it's weird. 

Recording: (2596/ 9621) 
 and then remember back on it. 

Recording: (2597/ 9621) 
 like ever, but I don't know, it's real weird. 

Recording: (2598/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2599/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (2600/ 9621) 
 Well, I think that my opinion is that if you ain't going to school and you're not going, you're not working and everything, you should be doing something besides causing problems, you know. And a lot of kids, that's all they really want to do nowadays is just cause aggravation to people. 

Recording: (2601/ 9621) 
 to the hub, which of course eliminated downtime. But with that, we were not in a position to monitor traffic. 

Recording: (2602/ 9621) 
 Bye-bye. 

Recording: (2603/ 9621) 
 And I think, of course we would all hope that abortion wouldn't be, that nobody would have an abortion. That would be the perfect world, because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one. But I also think, yeah, there shouldn't be, there shouldn't spend six weeks on abortion, or six weeks on what to do if you're pregnant. But I think the subject has to be mentioned just in passing in health class maybe and then it should be known that you can go to your counselor. 

Recording: (2604/ 9621) 
 And I sit there and go, you know, I tell people, I go to the VA clinic and everything, they got a homeless thing over there. And I say, you know, this guy, Brenda, I know, you know, he's a Vietnam vet. You guys need to get out there and help him, you know? I mean, you're in more of a situation than I am to be able to go out and sit there. But he wants me to take him like Mary Haven or something like that. And he's been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out. 

Recording: (2605/ 9621) 
 of the medical school class, which is 220. 

Recording: (2606/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2607/ 9621) 
 Ninja Turtle. Well, the kids went into that just so intensively and they were supposed to be real good guys. But I mean, the visual was pretty miserable. In my opinion, they wore these masks and hoods and 

Recording: (2608/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2609/ 9621) 
 Kind you know, we know but it's 

Recording: (2610/ 9621) 
 That'd be great. I would do it, definitely. 

Recording: (2611/ 9621) 
 If you got a car, it's easy to get there. But if you're riding a bus, it sometimes takes a couple hours. 

Recording: (2612/ 9621) 
 In some ways I like it, in some ways it's not my favorite place, but it seems like it's a relatively safe place to live, although that's coming from me. I've been robbed at gunpoint or knife point about four times, I think, in Columbus, yeah, maybe five. I drove a taxi cab for a couple summers, and I was robbed, I think twice, driving the cab. And part of it was just being stupid, but it was down around the Mount Vernon area and I got very little money, but I wasn't hurt. 

Recording: (2613/ 9621) 
 on TV and in the movies. 

Recording: (2614/ 9621) 
 I love Columbus actually. When I left I was fed up with Columbus. But like anything, after being away for a while and not really being, I mean I have friends there and everything, but I miss my friends and I miss really sort of knowing everything in a city, because London is never gonna be like that for me. And it's just a totally different experience. I did miss Columbus and I'm kind of glad to be back. Although now I miss London. 

Recording: (2615/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2616/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2617/ 9621) 
 They tried sampling. Well, my brother Rich was one of the families they sampled. 

Recording: (2618/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2619/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2620/ 9621) 
 Instead they pick up on, oh, so-and-so was arrested for drug dealing today. He, you know, so-and-so age. And they sort of give a background on him. And that's what everyone bases their view on, it seems to be, is that everyone turns to the media to see what's going on when the media is only showing one side of the story. I mean, there's definitely much more out there that's going on than they're telling you. So I really don't see a big problem with the way America is going or whatever the youth and like I said I wouldn't say it's any worse than any past generations. I mean other than like I mean obviously guns and things like that are being around but simply the reason being was because in past generations they weren't around for it. 

Recording: (2621/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we didn't really get the videotape they gave us was half infomercials and then things like how to clean the umbilical cord. I mean stuff like that. But as far as actual parenting things went, there was really nothing. 

Recording: (2622/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it actually is his dad's mother babysits. 

Recording: (2623/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2624/ 9621) 
 But the professors seem more centered to me. They're like, you have to balance it, which I'm sure is the truth. You can't diminish all your bottom line for making your workers feel good. But there's still something to it, I think. 

Recording: (2625/ 9621) 
 Again, it gets back to the 10% tithing. And I think there's something else in the Bible where the lady gives only a small portion compared to a large portion, but in relation to what her income was, that meant a lot more. And that we need to get more involved in that. We need to promote more of that. If we're going to package things and materialize, we need to think more of that. But I think really take home a night. What would you be doing if you're a third world country, didn't have a choice? 

Recording: (2626/ 9621) 
 I said, this will never work. I'm not interested. Take it back. And he said, no, no, no. Just work with us. Just work with us. We'll take care of this. So I end up selling to him for $144. But it was just funny, because I thought, they're never going to get to where I have to be, and we're not even going to play this game back and forth. 

Recording: (2627/ 9621) 
 Dwi'n credu bod hynny'n ddiddorol. 

Recording: (2628/ 9621) 
 uh... i mean obviously it's something that happens every day and things like that uh... like said by no means my saying a go president clinton or anything like that but uh... and i can't say it hold it against him for doing something like that i mean it's nothing that threaten the nation or whatever 

Recording: (2629/ 9621) 
 Aww. 

Recording: (2630/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2631/ 9621) 
 I think that 

Recording: (2632/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2633/ 9621) 
 Like they were expensive copy and paste collars. In the home, and they're just like oh well. They'll learn it there or whatever and the kids Their basic where they learn things is their peers. They don't get everything instilled at home that's pretty much what you know I seen talking to my husband and you know and there's so many broken homes and single moms and trying to do it all. And the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to grow up before they're ready. 

Recording: (2634/ 9621) 
 I think there might be, but I think most of them are a dying breed. They're the older citizens. Many in my generation, it's probably because I'm the early baby boom. I'm the first of the baby boom. And that's when the women's movement started. And many men there still haven't always accepted that. So there might be a problem there. But for the generations, even the later baby boom generations behind me, when I talk to them, I talk to high school students or even young college students, there's a whole world of difference between their attitudes and a lot of things. And women's minority issues, it's just secondhand to them. It's not like it was for us, which was a sea change. For them, it's normal. So, and more of those people are in the voting population if they would vote. You know, you'd have to find a candidate who would know how to do what Clinton did in 92 and get out that college vote. 

Recording: (2635/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2636/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2637/ 9621) 
 They just had a baby a couple days ago. Yeah, they had a little boy and I got a little sister. She is 22 and she lives with her boyfriend. 

Recording: (2638/ 9621) 
 Not as much as I used to be when I was younger used to be diehard but not anymore Yeah by their standards, but they still were 66, you know, they probably Could have won maybe a couple more games, but that's about it. You know, really 

Recording: (2639/ 9621) 
 It was cool. So I like pretty much all kinds of music. I dig sometimes to find the kind of music I really don't like that much. And I like some country music. I guess my favorites are classical and rock, rock and roll, especially. I like some of the stuff that's coming out now. I like oldies from the 70s and 60s. And I guess what's hard for me to listen to is, I guess, I don't know, it used to be WNCI, where they... part of the reason was they just played the same songs over and over again. Yeah. 

Recording: (2640/ 9621) 
 Oh my gosh. They don't have any of these student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty, huh? 

Recording: (2641/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (2642/ 9621) 
 Excuse me, but you know what I mean. 

Recording: (2643/ 9621) 
 to do that. 

Recording: (2644/ 9621) 
 Whoops. 

Recording: (2645/ 9621) 
 I shouldn't be having to clean quite as much as I do now. I'd say by 10 they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themselves. I know I did it 10 and to be able to do their laundry maybe definitely help out a lot around the house. 

Recording: (2646/ 9621) 
 center of all things evil in the world. 

Recording: (2647/ 9621) 
 And my oldest sister started a school out there. 

Recording: (2648/ 9621) 
 and they're at the Nazareth Towers, which is good because they get better care there. 

Recording: (2649/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2650/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2651/ 9621) 
 Especially the guys, yeah. 

Recording: (2652/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2653/ 9621) 
 Like I know, like I was a four-year member of student council and like did that, went that route in high school. And I know we always tried to involve other people, but like they would look at us and be like, that's so lame, I would never do it. 

Recording: (2654/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (2655/ 9621) 
 I said, man, why are they pulled over like that? There must be something going on. He goes, oh, we ain't going to worry about it right now. I'm going to get back up there. 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I look over, and there's this big old white swirling cloud comes down. It's about two miles west of us. I'm coming just out of my screws here. I'm just going. 

Recording: (2656/ 9621) 
 I was thinking of grandchildren. 

Recording: (2657/ 9621) 
 Right. Well, and I'm right now I'm 45 years old, so I've lived in or around Columbus for most of 44 years, excluding times when I was away at school. 

Recording: (2658/ 9621) 
 Every time I found myself it goes up. It's a nice feature. Sorry, I'll stop. Go ahead. It doesn't matter. When I clear my throat and you're listening to it, it's going to be annoying as hell. Yeah, my apologies in advance. 

Recording: (2659/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2660/ 9621) 
 And as a way I put it, it's kind of new agey and I don't like new agey stuff. But, you know, it's the best example is moths from the dark. When you flip on a light, the moths will go right to it. A child like that, a young man like that is very impressionable, very young still. And these bad spirits will be flocked right to him. 

Recording: (2661/ 9621) 
 Well, I haven't read enough to know. I saw a preliminary saying that they were going to protest, but I'm not informed enough to give an opinion on that. 

Recording: (2662/ 9621) 
 Yeah, okay. See, the way I look at heaven myself is that I have a chance to meet all my acquaintances I had over the past. 

Recording: (2663/ 9621) 
 you know, how to modify, like I give in services all the time at my school for the regular ed teachers and I show them, they go, well that's going to make more work for me and I say, how is telling the student to do every other problem instead of all 40 of them going to make 

Recording: (2664/ 9621) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (2665/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2666/ 9621) 
 Do you know what I mean? 

Recording: (2667/ 9621) 
 Yeah, one of my friend's cousins went to that fraternity. I don't remember what the cause was of his death, but I mean, like I said, I mean, it definitely is a dangerous drug to be using. And I mean, not to say that they should legalize it or anything. I mean, obviously, that's pretty extreme to do. But like I said, I mean, it's something more where people should know the risks of it and know what goes into it. I mean, it's sort of like if you saw something laying on the street and you decided to eat it or whatever. 

Recording: (2668/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2669/ 9621) 
 Well, my family is so funny because my parents are so, you would never put them together now. Back then, you know my, well you saw my mom, no you didn't see her. She's cute, she's got a little haircut, she's all like. 

Recording: (2670/ 9621) 
 No, the worst thing that happened was a wallet got stolen out of a locker. 

Recording: (2671/ 9621) 
 Relaxes. Yeah. 

Recording: (2672/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2673/ 9621) 
 You know? Yeah. 

Recording: (2674/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (2675/ 9621) 
 It really doesn't look like... I mean... 

Recording: (2676/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (2677/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2678/ 9621) 
 And it's like a car has a computer, but it does not know if it is Monday or 2050. It has no idea. It means nothing. It's not date sensitive, you know. 

Recording: (2679/ 9621) 
 No, the only Germans I ever saw were POWs. 

Recording: (2680/ 9621) 
 and partying sound pretty good, so. 

Recording: (2681/ 9621) 
 I like it better than a magazine. 

Recording: (2682/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2683/ 9621) 
 It was for me and a couple other people that was it 

Recording: (2684/ 9621) 
 But 

Recording: (2685/ 9621) 
 Well, among the people I know, I think it's a pretty tolerant city. I know a lot of people who live down in Old Town, you know, in a very diverse environment. And, you know, I just don't personally know any racists, I don't think. 

Recording: (2686/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. So was there more of, like, actual dating, would you say? No, no, there was more just getting, you know, going out. You know, what do you do on Saturday night? Nothing. You want to go out? Yeah. All right, we'll just go out, you know. And maybe get a kiss or something, you know, or go out and bid your cop's bill, you know. 

Recording: (2687/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2688/ 9621) 
 Yeah, or more, you know, I don't even know. Because it's just such a huge problem and it's gotten so out of hand. It's going to be everybody all together that has to work. It's going to be the teachers and the government and everybody. But they all have to have one common thing. And it cracks me up because we're so concerned about Elion, this poor little kid. Everybody knows who he is. But, you know, you look at our own kids. We don't even care about our own kids as much as we care. I mean, here's this little kid. Everybody knows who he is. But you know you look at our own kids. We don't even care about our own kids as much as we care. I mean here's this little kid who still has a living parent. And I don't understand that at all. I mean that is just so. I think the government gets involved in totally you know way out of line and 

Recording: (2689/ 9621) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (2690/ 9621) 
 I like this stuff as opposed to sitting around and playing computer games, first of all, because it's more interesting. It's a lot more practical. It's a little more problem solving, less running around and shooting things. It's like problem solving type little puzzles. It's not as much sit in front of a TV and be entertained. It's you create your own entertainment. 

Recording: (2691/ 9621) 
 hide in your basement again. And I mean, you can... 

Recording: (2692/ 9621) 
 No, I don't see that kind of racism at all. 

Recording: (2693/ 9621) 
 It's interesting too because when she had her other child, she was at Otterbein then. She made arrangements that she might have to be in the hospital taking a final with one of her teachers. That baby was born in March. I think she got the finals right in. it's just too much stress for me to even think about. 

Recording: (2694/ 9621) 
 Even though I knew better at the point when I was faced with that at 17 or whatever, I wanted to be loved so bad that it was something that I, you know what I mean? And I knew better, but you just, you know, and it's like, well, I wasn't that strong granted, but I was probably the normal teen. And I think most of the people I knew at that age were lost at much younger than 17, you know? Okay, 11, 12, it's like, who we would look alike? Forget it. But yeah, so I think I think birth control would be good. 

Recording: (2695/ 9621) 
 I don't have a plane ticket yet, I have a URL pass though. 

Recording: (2696/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. He did some assistant coach work at the OSU, for OSU. He really liked that. 

Recording: (2697/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2698/ 9621) 
 Because apparently they get really fascinated by the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them. So I'd do it right in front of their face and they'd be like, dude, thanks. 

Recording: (2699/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2700/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2701/ 9621) 
 I was married but I didn't have any kids. Once you have kids you're not going to be able to do that kind of a schedule. But yeah, so I didn't take off any time. And then when I got my master's I ran into an old friend of mine who teaches in Worthington and he said, oh, I'm the special ed director up there now. We need a resource room teacher. Why don't you come up and interview for this position or that position. When I went up and interviewed for that position, got another position, but anyway it all worked out. 

Recording: (2702/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, just sit on it. She's not allowed on the couch, but we had caught her last winter on the couch. You know, you come home and it's warm and, hey, there's a doggy bone up here. Hmm. 

Recording: (2703/ 9621) 
 Even they don't get facts right a lot of the time. 

Recording: (2704/ 9621) 
 And I couldn't be a part of a veterinary practice that did that. 

Recording: (2705/ 9621) 
 Um, there were one or two. 

Recording: (2706/ 9621) 
 Oh, sure. Yeah. 

Recording: (2707/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (2708/ 9621) 
 Well, that's what I'm saying. 

Recording: (2709/ 9621) 
 So it's really weird because, uh... 

Recording: (2710/ 9621) 
 Right, right. And it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to tell a teacher, I'm supposed to get an A. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? 

Recording: (2711/ 9621) 
你呀 

Recording: (2712/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (2713/ 9621) 
 And of course that never happened. 

Recording: (2714/ 9621) 
 So it worked out well. 

Recording: (2715/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2716/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2717/ 9621) 
 And as more and more people are getting older and older, there'll be more need for it. There's gonna be a lot of things there's gonna be more need for as people get older. 

Recording: (2718/ 9621) 
 No, I feel funny that I'm, I mean I wish I was married. If I was married it would be so much simpler in life, but you know it just didn't work out. You know I was with his father for like nine years since I was 16 and he just didn't grow up once we had him. He didn't change like I changed and so. 

Recording: (2719/ 9621) 
 I don't want either of these people. 

Recording: (2720/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2721/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he's a real nice guy. 

Recording: (2722/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you should be well aware because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now. So, you know, but you can tell how your child's doing, of course. 

Recording: (2723/ 9621) 
 17 and 19. 

Recording: (2724/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2725/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (2726/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (2727/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2728/ 9621) 
 This is the only society that labels them mentally ill. 

Recording: (2729/ 9621) 
 Heh heh heh 

Recording: (2730/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (2731/ 9621) 
 But at the same time, I don't dislike him or anything for it. It's their choice. The fact of the matter is, it doesn't have any effect or anything on my life. 

Recording: (2732/ 9621) 
 I picked up one kid he he had been in he was only about 15. He was adopted and he ran away 

Recording: (2733/ 9621) 
 no i mean like said i think a little kids are going to be a little kids if that stuff was not to be there still gonna act the same way there's no going to be walk around with toy guns things like that playing war whatever 

Recording: (2734/ 9621) 
 I mean, that's a lot of money for having a good time, you know? 

Recording: (2735/ 9621) 
 I'm telling you, some people go nuts with the name. I worked at a children's hospital when I was in college, at the Ear, Nose, and Throat Outpatient Clinic a couple summers, and I'm telling you, I had to put some names on the books like you wouldn't believe. Ima Darling, that was her name, Ima Darling. And there was a little boy named Ephraim Zimbalist Jr. Coca-Cola Franklin. I'm supposed to fit that in a space like that? No, I'm telling you. 

Recording: (2736/ 9621) 
 My name is- 

Recording: (2737/ 9621) 
 you know, about $70,000 and it was just a hard decision to make, you know, because I felt, you know, a lot more should have come from that. I mean, joking around, you know, I saw the Adam Sandler movie, Big Daddy, he got his foot run over by a cab and there was a line in there, pardon me, where he says, well, I got my foot run over by a cab and that cab was huge and a jury decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth $200,000. 

Recording: (2738/ 9621) 
 and a lot more different suburbs. So maybe it's going and becoming a little wealthier. 

Recording: (2739/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2740/ 9621) 
 And I just sit there for a minute before I take it out. I take it on out, sit on top of the line. I said, well, mommy said a bad word. I guess that, uh, mommy has to have soap in her mouth, doesn't she? I get to put soap in your mouth, mommy. 

Recording: (2741/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm Yeah, there's almost nobody anymore that's willing to do just miniscule things Unless you're going to get paid for it. It's just always money money money money money money money money just 

Recording: (2742/ 9621) 
 There's apartments above them. 

Recording: (2743/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2744/ 9621) 
 She went to Columbus Alternative High School. 

Recording: (2745/ 9621) 
 That way at least we could move around a little bit. 

Recording: (2746/ 9621) 
 when I started dating at almost 17. So no, I think you learn a lot from your family and the way their relationships are. I personally don't think a school can do it. 

Recording: (2747/ 9621) 
 You know, I mean, I liked Earl Bruce and I waited on him a couple of times at a restaurant I worked at. He was the nicest man. And when they did that, I don't know if you know about that, when they fired him the day before the Michigan game for having a nine to three season three years in a row. They fired him the day before that game. 

Recording: (2748/ 9621) 
 Right, right. Right. 

Recording: (2749/ 9621) 
 Oh is it really? Have you been there? 

Recording: (2750/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2751/ 9621) 
 They need a lot of women in that field. They need good people there. The money doesn't hurt. 

Recording: (2752/ 9621) 
 No, but I have two daughters and two sons. I heard my daughters talking about they want to do something special for my 65th birthday. They had given me a party on my 60th, so I don't know what it's going to be. But I think they'll do. They talked about something in the way of a trip, so maybe something the three of us can do together. 

Recording: (2753/ 9621) 
 Not at all. 

Recording: (2754/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2755/ 9621) 
 I don't remember exactly. Probably so. 

Recording: (2756/ 9621) 
 whatever you're gonna get away with. 

Recording: (2757/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (2758/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (2759/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (2760/ 9621) 
 I went to... It's the new high school there. 

Recording: (2761/ 9621) 
 I've gone to one, but I had a back problem. That's how I dealt with it, and it worked. 

Recording: (2762/ 9621) 
 I don't, I mean there definitely is that image of Dallas and Dynasty. I think it's worse, I think, for the image of the tourists. Like basically they think anyone who can afford to be over there must be absolutely loaded. And that was sort of another thing when I went to school there is I had a scholarship, that's how I went there. I worked the whole time. I was in high school and college and all this kind of thing, but it was just like people just thought, oh, you are American, you're here, therefore you must have lots of extra money to throw around. They just sort of don't grasp the fact that you can have made sacrifices to be there. But I do think also in films, I remember actually being in Bristol in that film California with Brad Pitt and Julie Lewis and they're in the trailer and everything else and their accent and I remember a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like, oh, you know, something like, is that what they talk like or is that what it's like in the South? And I thought, oh my gosh, you know, what an image to have of like the South and you know, I was just kind of shocked at this but I think that they're, you know, with people who are going to university there and things like that, there isn't necessarily that opinion. Maybe, you know, in a certain sector, like when all you've heard is the consumption and everything else, there might be more of that idea, but I think most people like me or whatever, well, I shouldn't say like, but people who have more education, not even without having to really think about it, but there isn't just that blatant view. I think that it is the consumption thing. I think a lot more realize now that I think Americans have this reputation which is totally true for spending, spending, spending. Obviously when you give that a closer look so many. I mean I think I just saw something else in the news that said, you know, across the board we don't even break even. We're like negative one or something. 

Recording: (2763/ 9621) 
 Oh, you're kidding. 

Recording: (2764/ 9621) 
 Yes, mucho es money. 

Recording: (2765/ 9621) 
 people drive by and look at my little house there in the middle of it all. 

Recording: (2766/ 9621) 
 But it's another thing that they're in their own, in the house where the parents are every night and not going into the garage and finding things. 

Recording: (2767/ 9621) 
 I have a decoder card. What it does is it decodes the DVD right away rather than sending it through the processor. So it's a lot faster. It doesn't depend on my processor time. The movie doesn't skip or anything. It just goes straight through. So what do you do? Do you have meetings and then talk about computer stuff? Or are you able to go to trade shows? No, no, nothing like that. Twice a month, we have our technical modules, which are we hook up these tiny little green screen computers, the little old keyboards from like 1985. I sit there and tinker around on those. 

Recording: (2768/ 9621) 
 I live at 161 in Cleveland area, an apartment up there. 

Recording: (2769/ 9621) 
 I always hate it when people name their kids Jamilia, Kenesha, and I'm like. 

Recording: (2770/ 9621) 
 and now they live in gay relationships. 

Recording: (2771/ 9621) 
 They went to private schools, I certainly did not want them to go to public schools, even when going to Ohio State. Compared to Miami University I see a difference in the standards of the students. But I believe and I've seen it with my son going to Ohio State that his morals that he's gained through his pre-college years are staying with him. And I'm very grateful that there's a spiritual guidance. I keep telling these guys, my daughter and son, that they'd come to me for answers. I don't know, that's probably the other problem. Sometimes the siblings or the children do not have a parent to go to. But again, let me reiterate, we don't have a smooth marriage. They saw us have difficult times and they saw us, our spouses crying together, forgiving one another, arguing with another just as much as you can have be in a human relation. They saw that. They saw the love for one another. They saw overnight where I'd start caring for my dad because my mother died instantly, you know, like short term, an hour. And now he had a stroke. I didn't know whether I saved their lives. And had learned all that and I had to take care of him but then I saw my wife taking over some of my role at home. So we swing him that's what I said a team player we knew what we had to do. My son might come home and say well gee you know he might smart off my wife would say hey that's your dad give him respect. 

Recording: (2772/ 9621) 
 and decisions are happening to her without her making them. And I think she needs to have as many facts as she can get her hands on. 

Recording: (2773/ 9621) 
 do whatever I want to some degree. 

Recording: (2774/ 9621) 
 But she doesn't believe it. Yeah, yeah, she's very pragmatic. She could probably. 

Recording: (2775/ 9621) 
 And pretty much stuff like that. And he'd try to quote the Bible and I'd have a Bible there with me and I'd look it up and it wouldn't be right at all. 

Recording: (2776/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. So I said, well, you know, I went to Padre Island. I said, well, I didn't want to get, you know, it's in Texas. 

Recording: (2777/ 9621) 
 Actually he in the 50s he had a jazz club and It was real popular it had food and live music Peggy Lee sang there and some kind of name people I wasn't around but And also he had a private club. That's It was similar to the bunny club It was the key club where people had to pay a membership and it was in a real nice area downtown here and he's also owned he's a he's a broker he sells liquor licenses and things so he's owned several kinds of bars but originally owned the open the top steakhouse which is real popular in Bexley and then sold it like three years later so mainly clubs and businesses but two really good restaurants 

Recording: (2778/ 9621) 
 She did. My ex-wife did. I would have preferred her to continue going to school, but she had some problems with some students and stuff. 

Recording: (2779/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (2780/ 9621) 
 Well, actually, anybody can try. There is a civil service exam you have to take, and they place you on a list from that, say if you have an 80, well, everybody that takes it after you that gets an 81 is going to get hired before you do. So you can take it again, but if you score lower, you've got to keep that lower score. So sometimes people are kind of apprehensive about doing that. But once you pass that, and then they say, the government goes, OK,, we're ready to hire a thousand people throughout the United States. Well, each region, there's regions in the United States, they may get like 30 for the Great Lakes region. So they go down the list, the first 30, and they call, you know, they write each one of them and say, we're offering you a position, do you want it or not? And, you know, some of the people have said, well, I've been on the list for two years and I have a job and I don't want it it now. Those people have to go to Oklahoma City, to the Academy, and go through a screening program, which is really hard. At one time, only 40% of the people were making it through that. 

Recording: (2781/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2782/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2783/ 9621) 
 and you need to have the violence and stuff like that. I have never heard, and you know, I'm just using pot right now. 

Recording: (2784/ 9621) 
 We went back to our room and we watched a movie. My roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer. 

Recording: (2785/ 9621) 
 No, I've never been to that one. That one has a big reput... 

Recording: (2786/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2787/ 9621) 
 one of those. 

Recording: (2788/ 9621) 
 See ya. 

Recording: (2789/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2790/ 9621) 
 We should be getting pretty near. 

Recording: (2791/ 9621) 
 I think. 

Recording: (2792/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2793/ 9621) 
 but it takes away that big trip. We've been and then his brother got married in Hawaii. So we went out there. So we've just done the honeymoon at Disney World, the Albuquerque a couple times in Hawaii. But we have plans to go to Europe. He wants to go to England and things like that. And I want it we're looking into Greece. 

Recording: (2794/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (2795/ 9621) 
 Girlfriend works for Hell, also known as Ameritech. 

Recording: (2796/ 9621) 
 No! 

Recording: (2797/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2798/ 9621) 
 Buh- 

Recording: (2799/ 9621) 
 But that's how I see, the only regular crop they had when they were out there, my parents, was kids. 

Recording: (2800/ 9621) 
 Wow. I didn't realize that. 

Recording: (2801/ 9621) 
 especially if you're waiting to go into combat. 

Recording: (2802/ 9621) 
 I think that's too young to talk about birth control methods and everything, but with AIDS and as rampant as it is now, and there's so many more women that have it, start off it was mostly men, women have got to know at an early age about these different diseases and things. 

Recording: (2803/ 9621) 
 I remember a time when I was a brand new teacher, I was maybe fifth or sixth year of teaching. That's still pretty new. I said, John, what's your last name? He said, guess. I said, I don't feel like guessing. Tell me your last name. He said, guess. I said, John, I want to know your last name. And he said, G-U-E-S-S. I'm like, oh, sorry. Thank you. 

Recording: (2804/ 9621) 
 That was part of the reason. 

Recording: (2805/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2806/ 9621) 
 But in the winters when you know, I mean, I don't exercise that much. 

Recording: (2807/ 9621) 
 Right? 

Recording: (2808/ 9621) 
 It's a clinical study where we're seeing how treadmill training affects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury. 

Recording: (2809/ 9621) 
 I appreciate your opinions, but were you asking, have we seen a change in the politicians through our lifetime? Was that particularly your point? 

Recording: (2810/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2811/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2812/ 9621) 
 Do you think there's a heaven? 

Recording: (2813/ 9621) 
 I think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention. And I think that's a little harder because he was an only child for nearly five years. So it's been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother. It's really he nurtures him too. So that's neat to watch. 

Recording: (2814/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2815/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2816/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (2817/ 9621) 
 Here in Columbus, yeah, I've always lived in Columbus. 

Recording: (2818/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (2819/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2820/ 9621) 
 I went to OU for about three months, but I just got out of school, you know how it is. 

Recording: (2821/ 9621) 
 I would just tell him that is just a feeling he's going through. I've went through that where you look at a woman and she's attractive to you, but that's just something that's going through your mind. I think that's like the devil getting into you because I would never sleep with a woman. I would never do it even though I might be really, would have been real drunk and just you know I would just tell him that's something he's going through and that's wrong for him to do that He you know, he's a man And that would tell him God didn't put two men on this earth And if he would choose to do that that I wouldn't hate him or disown him or anything like that 

Recording: (2822/ 9621) 
 the opportunity to serve one another. And that's the downfall of our society because we're thinking more of ourselves instead of others. And I think as we become older, you start thinking about how much your weaknesses are, but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith. It's not the materialistic things that the university here professes to be the thing. 

Recording: (2823/ 9621) 
 I know, and you know, and the thing is, you're going to have a great time with your kids. And it's just, it's, it's, it's almost like if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this, it's worth it. 

Recording: (2824/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2825/ 9621) 
 You had it! 

Recording: (2826/ 9621) 
 I do it, so. 

Recording: (2827/ 9621) 
 He'll basically tell you he don't have no father except for me. 

Recording: (2828/ 9621) 
 Well, I... 

Recording: (2829/ 9621) 
 As it turned out, he expected us to play the solos. We didn't play the whole piece, we only played one movement of it. I thought it came out pretty well to have a recording of it. For a while there, I was worried that we didn't get a recording of it, and I was really upset. 

Recording: (2830/ 9621) 
 Right, you can't really ignore, I've heard people say, I refuse to read the dispatch. Well, you gotta know what's going on locally, I'm sorry. 

Recording: (2831/ 9621) 
 And so that's a whole different, that's real different from the way it used to be, even though it looks the same. 

Recording: (2832/ 9621) 
 Yeah, up on Bethel Road. 

Recording: (2833/ 9621) 
 If you didn't own, let's say on a school levy, you pay taxes, I always, because I rent and I always get very upset and very angry when people say, well you don't have to pay school taxes. Yes I do, because every time a school tax passes, my rent goes up. It's built into the rent. At least it ought to be or I have a pretty dumb landlord. And I've never lived any place where my rent didn't go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct proportion and beyond of what the levy was. So that would be the first thing I'd say. And then I'd also say that, you know, because a number of reasons that people don't vote for school levies now is because they don't have kids in the schools. But education is the foundation of a democracy. And if you don't have an educated citizenry, your democracy could go down the drain. That was why Thomas Jefferson founded so many schools or the University of Virginia and believed in education because he said without an educated citizenry, you won't understand the issues. But it's very difficult today to get to people. I've talked to some almost college-age students and they don't see the relationship. You can talk logic to them all you want and it's not like the logic gets to them. And you can talk history all you want and it doesn't mean anything to them and I don't know why. I wish I did but I don't know why. 

Recording: (2834/ 9621) 
 I had considered that yes. 

Recording: (2835/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm Yeah, I think basically that goes back to you know the parenting and everything, you know, there was something missing in the Child's life, you know That he wasn't getting perhaps attention Those kids in particular. I don't Understand how they could be building bombs and in their basement mom and dad not know what was going on. You know, I mean It's just a tragedy. I had a friend when I was a kid too that We were like, I don't know 11 years old or something like that. Well an accidental shooting and then and another friend of mine from the same class, you know. He pulled a gun and shot him, you know, and didn't know the damn thing was loaded. And they were talking about another thing about that, you know, where some kid, I guess that happened just here in town a couple, about a week ago or something like that, you know guy shot another guy. But I mean, those things are just senseless crimes, really. Who's really to fault, who's really, who's guilty, I don't know. I'd like to have, not to say they ever would have, but if one of the two that you, Columbine, if they would have survived, I'd like to have seen today ever would have but if one of the two that you that Columbine, you know If they would have survived I'd like to have seen what was going through their heads, you know But that's something we'll never know 

Recording: (2836/ 9621) 
 She didn't say anything. I mean, they wouldn't let her. 

Recording: (2837/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (2838/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (2839/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well there's too many situations out there to have everybody fit into certain ones. Every one of them is different. 

Recording: (2840/ 9621) 
 What's different is my old neighborhood is just exactly the same. And so from that angle, I mean, still is my elementary school sitting there. I went to for nine years and then North is not being used as a high school, but it's there a block away. Olentangy Village, I'm right in where I always was. I mean, I was raised on Como Avenue and I live two blocks away from there now. So I made a full circle there, but Columbus has changed in the downtown area, and it is really neat, you know, compared to any other cities. Of course, I loved Oregon. I was very rural for 18 years. 

Recording: (2841/ 9621) 
 Oh, no. 

Recording: (2842/ 9621) 
 It's in education, it's top. They produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate education. Business schools coming up, like they're building a new building, but I'll be gone by the time it's done if I decide to stay. So it'll be... So as far as education, like for a small school, and they just opened up their PhD program in education, and they're also known for political science, but it's a real conservative political science, and it it's a real conservative school and that doesn't really match my views on a lot of things. It's dry, they have real strict visitation policies, things like that. My thought is if you're considered an adult enough to move away then you shouldn't have that many restrictions. I can understand some because I remember when I was a freshman in college we did crazy things but still

 I don't think that divorce is a bad thing. I think that if you're married and you realize that you get to a point where you and this other person are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family, that it's better to just say, look, this is not working. We both deserve to be happy and go your own separate ways. I think for me personally, I would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where I wouldn't end up getting divorced just because I think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as coordinating coordinating things and I know that sounds kind of petty but just I mean I don't think it's I don't think it's bad but I think that that if you can find a way obviously to continue to make a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different.

And I said, and that's where it comes down to. The Catholic Church, for example, they can put all, you can get folk masses, you can do all this superficial stuff on a thing to make it more attractive. And they do, every religion makes it more attractive for it. Oh, it's usually more comfortable. Well, yeah. But the bottom line is you're trying to still, if you're a Christian, focus back to the Bible.

Recording: (2881/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (2882/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well... 

Recording: (2883/ 9621) 
 I do believe, I do believe and I think maybe I'll ask you because you're one of the younger generation. Haven't you had, as you have grown older, haven't you looked back sometimes and said, boy, mom was right about that, dad was right about that? I think the older a child gets, and that includes us too, now that we're our age because we're, I'm almost as old as my mother was when she died. I'm older than my father was when he died. I do believe, I see now where just living life, if you keep your eyes and ears open, and your mind, you got to have your mind open to receive what your eyes and ears are like, I guess. You learn things that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school. They help. They help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school. But there's a lot of things You're just not going to learn except by actual experience and living life And I believe that that's a lot of right there because I know I started to say well, you know I don't think I finished it. I myself have these once Getting only what I need versus all these little wants and desires Because I grew up in the depression and didn't have these things Consequently, I've got a doll collection a teddy bear collection an angel collection record collection you wouldn't believe a whole One whole wall of my room with books and books in another room but then the books I started when the kids were little because they did read at home and the libraries were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays and Consequently, I've kept the and it's amazing but some of those grandchildren, almost all of them, they come over to the house and if they get bored they'll go over to the bookcase and start looking for something to read. So it is good to have it available for them in the home to a certain extent. Now however, my one son's gone too far. He's got one room completely lined with books. And a hallway full of books. And I don't know if the kids ever go and pick those up or not because they're always going to the library So you see it's what is taught at home That really counts, but we don't need all those material things and now I'm sitting back and thinking well Which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are gonna keep this or shall I have an auction and spend the money and travel? You see what I mean? You change. Your opinions change as you get older and you begin to look back. I don't think I was ever a spendthrift to the point that I did things foolishly. Some things I did do foolish, but I mean, you know, on an overall basis. 

Recording: (2884/ 9621)

 And that's the generation I'm talking about. Those are the generation that went through the depression and so forth. They were the cash... I feel sorry for your generation, which is my daughter's generation and probably my son's. Because I don't see how in the heck, wages aren't going up that much, prices, consumerism's going up. Somewhere along the line, the consumer's going to have to start getting a little wiser and say,

 Oh, you vacuumed. Oh, it's so nice in here. Thank you. And that's pretty good. There are a lot of people out there that wouldn't even notice. Of course, then there are the days when I don't get around to it. I know you must notice. 

Recording: (2891/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but it's their stupid laws. 

Recording: (2892/ 9621) 
 I said I didn't want to see that, I would much rather have my own opinion of what it's going to be like and go by what other people said.

 Hmm.

 who can help you with that. 

Recording: (2901/ 9621) 
 Is new stuff everyone can allow? because a lot of the people in that group are paid. I get paid, it's kind of a semi-professional aspect thing where you get paid per service. But let's see. So they have to balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for with the amount of music that they want to do. And this last year we played a movement of a Schumann concert piece for four horns and orchestra and I was a little bit flabbergasted when I saw that on the schedule at the beginning of the year because it's really hard to play and I thought is he expecting us to play this the solos or is he expecting to bring in somebody

 Yeah.

 I don't think so. 

Recording: (2909/ 9621) 
 No, it's in the Ag College, but why it's there, I don't know. It's a matter of how they fit it in there, but it's dealing with construction management.

 But even so, we were on this and the Germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could, again, look right down at us. So we didn't go out in the daylight hardly at all.

 You're allowed to have guests of the same sex. Like, I don't live in the dorms, but assuming I did, if I had a girl come from home to visit me, I'd have to either sneak her in and just hope we didn't get caught or have her stay at a friend's.

 The ultimate would probably be a part-time thing, but neither one of our positions offer any type of part-time work. We have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something, which is, they get a little bit of both the worlds.

 Yes, mm-hmm. Yeah, I do miss that, but at the same time, I've, you know, I had a lot of opportunity to be there and to do those things, so. And I mean, there are, you know, it's obviously you can't compare it, but you know, there are cultural things to do in Columbus, and it does sort of make me mad when, you know, people are kind of like, oh, Columbus, you know, there's nothing to do there. I find myself defending Columbus a lot more now than,

 Oh.

 because there's no fear of being caught by the parents.

 So. 

Recording: (2951/ 9621) 
 That is. 

Recording: (2952/ 9621) 
 So I almost bought one a couple weeks ago. In fact, I went into contract on it with this guy, this dear old man, it was for his mother who was in her 90s in a retirement home, it was on Royal Forest, which is north. And I made this low offer and I never thought that they would, I didn't want, it was kind of like, I felt like I had to do this because if I was gonna get this house, I should get it. But I didn't really want now because I have the baby coming and we're going to be busy and I didn't want to get involved in it. And so I made this offer and then he countered back. You know, I offered him 92 and he was asking 99.9. So he counted back at 96. And I said, you know, I thought, I have to worry about he's never going to come to it. So I wrote back and said, you know, I appreciate your offer, but 92, 92 is almost not feasible for me. And 92.5 was really the only thing I could do. And I didn't even give him a time to respond, because I just assumed, I was just bowing out of it. 

Recording: (2953/ 9621) 
 I think it's probably some of both. I think it's probably more social But I mean obviously they're gonna have different views on how things work But I mean for the most part I can't see that as being too big of a problem Obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that than there are women. But at the same time, I wouldn't say there's anything too overpowerful as far as the number of guys being out there that are violent. I mean, it's something that unfortunately does happen, but it's more how you're brought up, whether you can control it or not. 

Recording: (2954/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (2955/ 9621)

And if it weren't for that, some of the things we wouldn't know. And I think that as you increase your knowledge, you're far better off than to stay in this little hole over here and this is all I want to know about.

Recording: (2971/ 9621) 
 I think Columbus is really interesting how it develops compared to, I don't know, just how Indianapolis, how Columbus is a real standard Midwest city, just how it's designed and laid out compared to Philadelphia, or just when it was settled and when it was made, just how more the streets are more, it's all planned out more as opposed to in Philly or places like that that more East Coast. It's like the roads Parts of them are real small and like and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff and so that's kind of interesting I mean, I think It's also I like the urban sprawl of Columbus how? This is just the suburbs develop and how it's like more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized area that's really big. Like Columbus downtown is really odd too. I mean, there's nothing to do down there. It's all businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six. I mean, there's like a couple restaurants or something. But I mean, it's different when you think of other cities, you know, it's more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out, but here it's like campus or more of a, 

Recording: (2972/ 9621) 
 But I mean, it was nothing too serious or violent.

Recording: (2977/ 9621) 
 Not that they could have stopped it, but they should have known what was going on. I really think if they were close with their children, they would have known something was wrong, especially with these kids who are so removed and don't talk to their parents and start dressing certain ways. You know that they're going to, turning a different, you know, I just, I blame them though.

I'm like, I planted those. You see the Jack Nicklaus golf statue in front of the clubhouse. I planted the flowers around that. No, I don't want to watch it for the golf at all. I just want to turn it on and see it occasionally.

 Yeah, I do. I really do. I mean, these kids are getting guns. A lot of them is from their parents, but it's amazing how many guns and they say that the police are selling guns to people and they don't realize, you know, they're old guns that they confiscate and they don't realize where they're going. I mean, that amazes me. But there's always going to be the underworld in different ways that kids and people can get guns. And it's sad. I don't know how we could ever limit that. But there's so many millions of guns in the world that you're wondering, where are they all coming from? But I think laws can help, especially with children. And they have these new guns that, not just a safety lock, but it's like an identification thing.

Well, I think a lot of times when there's a stepfather involved, you know, that becomes a problem for some of them. But they said, you know, you might run into a case where, you know, the family's abusing the child. You know, but I didn't run into that. 

Recording: (2990/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (2991/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2992/ 9621) 
 That's why it's mainly appealing to in-state people. They pay you to go to school. 

Recording: (2993/ 9621) 
 you know and they did want the children 

Recording: (2994/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (2995/ 9621) 
 This fall is the first time I'll be submitting my portfolio. 

Recording: (2996/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (2997/ 9621) 
 No, I do really believe that if they would have something like that instead of some of the even those shows are no good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes I turn them off for some of the stupid things they do 

Recording: (2998/ 9621) 
 great yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful things that I'm used to but he's got all of this so I'll get that little slice and take the rest so that worked out 

Recording: (2999/ 9621) 
 watching it for a while period and then since Deep Space Nine left I needed a little Star Trek fix every once in a while. So I started watching it. I also don't have cable so it's on UPN and 53 doesn't come in terribly well so I mean sometimes it's like I don't want to kind of see what's going on. 

Recording: (3000/ 9621) 
 I was interested in going out to California and I've been out there several times but it was supposed to be tight. Why wasn't I interested in moving out with my mother? 

Recording: (3001/ 9621) 
 Ew. 

Recording: (3002/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (3003/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3004/ 9621) 
 Heh heh. 

Recording: (3005/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (3006/ 9621) 
 we should look at it as a sport. 

Recording: (3007/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, because if she was there charging her two bucks down there and I told her I says you need to really not get $20 out at a time because I said you need to get like 60 or 80 because it says you get 80 bucks out you're gonna pay $8 for it 20 bucks at a time but if you get 80 bucks out you're gonna get two bucks and she goes but if I have $80 I'll spend it and I says well you have a footlocker with a lock on it put $70 in there and have 10 on you and, oh. And I said, the only reason I know that is because that's what dad's got to do. I said, I can't carry money or I'll spend it, you know? 

Recording: (3008/ 9621) 
 that he remembers. He remembers the stepfathers and that kind of thing. It's just not a good stuff. 

Recording: (3009/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3010/ 9621) 
 They're just fine to go on strike any time they want to, however how they behaved during the strike was just disgusting. 

Recording: (3011/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3012/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3013/ 9621) 
 It was like five or six different doctors. So she's learned a lot more now the cancer, because she's never been in oncology at all. So it was always just trauma patients or open heart bypass patients, things like that. So it's been a whole new learning experience for her, too. 

Recording: (3014/ 9621) 
 here. 

Recording: (3015/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3016/ 9621) 
 I mean, that is a neighborhood mall. 

Recording: (3017/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3018/ 9621) 
 I don't know how to tell you that. 

Recording: (3019/ 9621) 
 Um, I'm a Lutheran and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 

Recording: (3020/ 9621) 
 So I think she's getting a better education than he did, but it's because she's doing the work and she knows she's expected to and has to. My son's the kind he'd rather play than work, and so he wrote a lot. 

Recording: (3021/ 9621) 
 That's it? 

Recording: (3022/ 9621) 
 I was only on the OP a few times, but one time we had a second lieutenant up there who was very congenial, I guess is a good word, isn't he? 

Recording: (3023/ 9621) 
 Because I mean you could actually grow that stuff, but it's kind of wintery now so you can't grow nothing right now. 

Recording: (3024/ 9621) 
 mom's a severe alcoholic. 

Recording: (3025/ 9621) 
 for someone to actually state in a class, if you breastfeed your baby, they're going to have a higher IQ than if you don't. I thought. 

Recording: (3026/ 9621) 
 Well, you can carry a weapon here in Columbus. I can carry a weapon right now as long as it's out in the open. 

Recording: (3027/ 9621) 
 Yeah, a lot more. 

Recording: (3028/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3029/ 9621) 
 Took a lot of time. 

Recording: (3030/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, I think it was just a political thing. 

Recording: (3031/ 9621) 
 now parked over here on the a section goes back and 

Recording: (3032/ 9621) 
 Like there'd be kids saying, yes ma'am, yes ma'am, yes ma'am in class and then they're out there smoking at the cars or cutting school and stuff. 

Recording: (3033/ 9621) 
 And it would take like years I would think to implement the program successfully. 

Recording: (3034/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (3035/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Life skills. 

Recording: (3036/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3037/ 9621) 
 So like there's not a lot you can really do with that. 

Recording: (3038/ 9621) 
 No, then you wouldn't be too familiar with everything. 

Recording: (3039/ 9621) 
 or crazy. 

Recording: (3040/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3041/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so she said she's going to be catching the disability bus out here, you know, after a certain amount of time, she's going to ride that bus. 

Recording: (3042/ 9621) 
 I have no idea where he was. And at the time, my mother-in-law was in a nursing home and had Alzheimer's, and my father-in-law was in the hospital. 

Recording: (3043/ 9621) 
 They have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you don't want to do it. Most usually I just put location. I don't want to go certain places. 

Recording: (3044/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3045/ 9621) 
 I think it is because when I was a sophomore in high school before, it dawned on me that tab A and slot B had any relation to this stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagrams. But I think kids are a lot more aware now because of what they're exposed to in movies and everything, TV, just daily life. They're a lot more aware. They go into it with a lot of myths and misapprehensions, but they definitely have thoughts about it, and I think they need to know. 

Recording: (3046/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like when I need things and I call him up, I need diapers, I need wipes, I need $20. Yeah, he's there for me for that. Financially, yeah, he's always been there for me. 

Recording: (3047/ 9621) 
 with their eye or the car accident. 

Recording: (3048/ 9621) 
 like on a fairly regular basis even. 

Recording: (3049/ 9621) 
 It's about the size of a very small hotel room, and then it's got a separate bathroom with a big bathtub. There's a little box on the wall about this big, that has some smelly stuff coming out of it. There's enough room where people can come in and sit down. There's a fold-out couch bed for whoever's in there with you, and they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it's born. 

Recording: (3050/ 9621) 
 It was during school, you'd go there, you went there for two years, your junior and senior year. And like your junior you'd go in the morning and your senior you'd go in the afternoon, but it took up pretty much your whole day, half of your day actually. You're at the career center, then you go back. 

Recording: (3051/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3052/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (3053/ 9621) 
 just because it was more like they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to I'm just doing this because I don't know why or whatever. And it seems like too, I hate it when people, it's obvious that if they didn't have the textbook, they wouldn't know how to do it. Where if people didn't have their notes, they wouldn't be able to do it themselves. So I think and like, you know, put a lot of effort into making it not the same every day and not just like a lecture and when we do homework and turn it in, like, you know, it's like we do like, like a history class, we do like role role playing things and like, 

Recording: (3054/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. Which is one of the things I ran into architecture where, I mean, we only had, you know, one or two papers we had to write. 

Recording: (3055/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3056/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3057/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3058/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3059/ 9621) 
 But it's a smaller Catholic school in St. Louis. 

Recording: (3060/ 9621) 
 They just can't single out what I should attend to and what I should screen out. So they attend to everything equally. The train going by out here, the teacher talking up here, the kid over here shuffling his papers, this kid back here picking up his pencil. And so they get a little bit of everything and they don't learn anything. 

Recording: (3061/ 9621) 
 And there's people like that today still. But I think people should go to retirement centers and sit down, make a visit to them every week, make a part of their life, and develop a friendship. 

Recording: (3062/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3063/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3064/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think they're trying to do more. I'm hoping they will. 

Recording: (3065/ 9621) 
 I went back and did a one year schooling to get my nursing license. I became an LPN. So I don't have a degree. My husband has a degree. I put him through school. I finished his private school. 

Recording: (3066/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3067/ 9621) 
 No commitment. If these guys have commitment and you see the guys out there, they want to go further possibly in their careers and professionals. Others want to maybe fulfill something, whatever it is. You ask each individual what it is that drives you. And that's the thing, I get so perturbed with interviewers. They ask somebody and somebody comes back and says, you know what I mean? Yeah. What did he, no, get inside the guy's mind. What did he mean? You know what I mean? Yeah. No, I don't know what you mean. Play dumb. Pull it out of him. What do you mean? Michael Red, what do you plan on doing after school? When I was growing up, they used to give the grade point average and the major of the student athlete. 

Recording: (3068/ 9621) 
 You talk to a computer always. You deal with a computer.

 She did go and see a psychologist, a child psychologist or something, and she was real bitter about the divorce, feeling that she was kind of the cause of it.

 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다. 

Recording: (3071/ 9621) 
 Me too. 

Recording: (3072/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3073/ 9621) 
 I can't say that it's an expectation. I still say that it has to come from the top down. 

Recording: (3074/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3075/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. You can bring that in-house, I think. I mean, I don't know, I might go out like we should and be completely wrong. 

Recording: (3076/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3077/ 9621) 
 A little bit of both I think. I looked into some phonics. I went to the library, checked out some phonics tapes, let him watch those because kids love to watch things. And just reading with them and going over things. It's been amazing just to see it's like the light bulb comes on. 

Recording: (3078/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3079/ 9621) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (3080/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, I could have just took him out in the woods and whooped him, but what's that gonna prove? 

Recording: (3081/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (3082/ 9621) 
 in your room, it's just like 40 of any other kind. It's plenty. 

Recording: (3083/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (3084/ 9621) 
 I took a class for word processing 1 and 2. I took those and I tell you truth I can't remember if they taught me how to balance a checkbook out. 

Recording: (3085/ 9621) 
 Oh, is he? 

Recording: (3086/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3087/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3088/ 9621) 
 Oh, sure. 

Recording: (3089/ 9621) 
 You're doing fine. 

Recording: (3090/ 9621) 
 I probably would like said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 

Recording: (3091/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3092/ 9621) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (3093/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3094/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3095/ 9621) 
 And I've got friends that do that and I just, I don't feel right. I don't wanna see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff. There's no way, uh-uh. 

Recording: (3096/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. 

Recording: (3097/ 9621) 
 I know, those are your hauls. 

Recording: (3098/ 9621) 
 So we're kind of doing that and then I figure I'm probably going to wait tables at night and finish going to school during the day. 

Recording: (3099/ 9621) 
 Well, he's exporting cars illegally. 

Recording: (3100/ 9621) 
 I was raised. 

Recording: (3101/ 9621) 
 That's, yeah, it's developmental. Because by the, did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school is because that's when some expert thought that one hemisphere or the other was dominant. But now they found out that the full dominance doesn't take over until about age eight. 

Recording: (3102/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3103/ 9621) 
 that's a big growing period, you know, from junior high to high school is when you really learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life. My mother was always home, she was, which was good to come home to because I had friends whose parent mothers weren't there and they had to clean, they had to start dinner, and they hated it, you know, I mean, and they feel that they kind of missed out on things. But I think, you know, kids, a lot of them who have, when parents have money and both parents worked, I'm not sure if the combine, if both parents worked, but I don't think just the mother being home there would have totally helped. No. 

Recording: (3104/ 9621) 
 death. 

Recording: (3105/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3106/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (3107/ 9621) 
 But her mother stayed with us for several, two or three years, and she was the babysitter for our oldest boy. 

Recording: (3108/ 9621) 
 And it really isn't though because I think it's actually, it's really freeing not to have to drink and all these things. So you just kind of, I feel like I can get along with any people. And so it doesn't really exclude you from anyone unless you would let it, I guess. And nobody's perfect. I mean, everybody has their prejudices, I guess, and fears, so getting over that is part of life for everyone. 

Recording: (3109/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3110/ 9621) 
 Yeah. So did you see pain? You just sort of followed somebody around? Yeah, I saw the patients in the morning. 

Recording: (3111/ 9621) 
 I'm a freelance artist, illustrator. In fact, marketing communications for Ohio State is one of my big clients. And I also have various part-time jobs for the medical insurance. 

Recording: (3112/ 9621) 
 I know it's connected to England, because I guess England owned it once. 

Recording: (3113/ 9621) 
 Really. 

Recording: (3114/ 9621) 
 It didn't hurt me none, you know I think just depends upon like I said a lot of factors, you know, it's your neighborhood your neighbors Most kids don't have nothing to do in their neighborhood even you know, how many empty lots do you see nowadays? It still comes back to Like when I was a kid, we had go-karts. We had many bikes. We had all that kind of stuff 

Recording: (3115/ 9621) 
 There's a lot more in college. College, it's seven nights a week. 

Recording: (3116/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. And some conservative values, too, you know, that the Republicans are supposed to represent, but I don't think they are doing a very good job of that. 

Recording: (3117/ 9621) 
 It's not a presidential issue, a candidate issue as far as I'm concerned. 

Recording: (3118/ 9621) 
 Yeah. or him. So was this guy who took the necklace, was he black? Or was he white? 

Recording: (3119/ 9621) 
 I don't see any reason for it myself, but that's interesting. When the time began, according to my, what I believe in and everything, it was man and woman got married. And the reason they got married is because of procreation, to keep the population going. I think that's the way it was set up originally. So I have no problem with a man being with a man or a woman being with a woman, but if that was the relationship for everybody, 

Recording: (3120/ 9621) 
 motherly instinct towards you know and they are like oh Eric you should have one and you know and he knows that one I just knew at a young age I've always loved the animals 

Recording: (3121/ 9621) 
 Katie, really? 

Recording: (3122/ 9621) 
 See, and I can't eat seafood, but I tried some once when I went to Las Vegas with my dad. And we didn't really have it. My mom didn't cook it at home, which I'm kind of glad she didn't. The smell of fish always kind of bothered me. But until I tried some crab meat and lobster, and within five minutes, I broke out into a rash. I mean, it was like a heat rash. I mean, it started on my neck. 

Recording: (3123/ 9621) 
 So I figure it's much better to be nice to them. Because there's also times when everybody makes errors. And maybe one of these times you make an error and I tell you to turn one way and you go, there's an airplane over there and I tell you to turn that way. And I really meant for you to turn left instead of right. And you may come back and go, do you mean left or right there? And I go, yes, that is correct. Turn left. So everybody helps. You know, I feel kindness goes a long way and the pilots the same way. Most often they're, you know, pretty decent. 

Recording: (3124/ 9621) 
 Well, I used to 

Recording: (3125/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3126/ 9621) 
 Yeah. To me that's sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you've done, that the kid did and you don't want him to do it again and let it go. They suspended him. I don't know if, of course, I'll probably say this. I got this version of this story from the Columbus Dispatch so it's probably not the whole story. Yeah. It is. 

Recording: (3127/ 9621) 
 It is. That's why I quit. 

Recording: (3128/ 9621) 
 It's like, we don't have one at home because we're worried. 

Recording: (3129/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because I have a problem with getting to know people. I'm shy at first. 

Recording: (3130/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (3131/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (3132/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's pretty much what we was made to do. Back in the pioneer days, you didn't have this crap with the kid going, get fix me some canned ravioli. You gave that kid a shotgun, he went out there and killed his own meals. That's an interesting thing I just saw in the paper in the Newsweek. I was reading that and 

Recording: (3133/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3134/ 9621) 
 and psychology. 

Recording: (3135/ 9621) 
 which I feel has been completely devoiced in America because of the effects of the Cold War. I've inherited this world where there were, of, where am I going with this? I mean, the generation before us had like Vietnam, they protested against it. I mean, they were in many ways protesting against the generation before, but when it came down to it, I mean, what was the protest really about? I'm not being clear, because I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with this. I'm very cynical about the world I've inherited, because I see a world in which my political views have been silenced by 50 years of international politics and propaganda that says to be left of a certain point is bad. Like among conservative circles, the word liberal is like, almost like calling someone a communist in the 40s. Whereas I'm very cynical about that because I feel that it wasn't, it's been a cultural process that has been developed and now I'm being handed this current situation which which I see as completely unfair. I mean, I think the reason that our generation is cynical, the reason I'm cynical is because we're handed a world in which we see the injustices of the past, or not the, the hypocrisy, I mean, I guess injustice also applies in terms of things like the Cold War and stuff. That's why I'm cynical. I hope that answers your question at least a little bit. I don't know. I feel kind of preachy. Like this is my position. 

Recording: (3136/ 9621) 
 taking classes. Hopefully that's when you go to the dentist and you know you catch up on all that stuff too. 

Recording: (3137/ 9621) 
 No, no, that's where have you been, shit. 

Recording: (3138/ 9621) 
 I'm 

Recording: (3139/ 9621) 
 was a man. 

Recording: (3140/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3141/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3142/ 9621) 
 That's number three. I have a very general opposition to this kind of I don't think we should be helping anybody else to, which is the largest one in the state of Ohio now, but I'm talking places like Washington Courthouse, which maybe have 15,000, or Wadsworth, which maybe have 18,000. This kinds of things being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those. And a consequence I feel it's breaking our society down to the point where we don't know our neighbors at all anymore. It's quite common anymore that if you go three houses down, you have no idea who those folks are, how they feel, what they might do for you or you can do for them. And that all applies to the Polaris question as I see it. And I think also that it's a very, very major financial gain for the developers who are doing it. And it's going to therefore harm the many, many areas that it affected, such as North, North, North, North, North, what's the name of the shop? North what? Northland, yeah Northland, I can't even say that. Okay. 

Recording: (3143/ 9621) 
 I was a kid that had battles with the bands at the mall. 

Recording: (3144/ 9621) 
 Oh boy, they're just really fun people to deal with. 

Recording: (3145/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because I mean five years went by like... 

Recording: (3146/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (3147/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (3148/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3149/ 9621) 
 Well that's right now. A lot of it. 

Recording: (3150/ 9621) 
 They'll go over well. Oh, we don't care how we're going to do that. We just want five guys out there in the court and so forth. But we're not going to, nah. We lost one, two academics this year. I don't know why, but we've got four guys in the class. That's OK. That's divorce. That's our attitude. 

Recording: (3151/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3152/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. 

Recording: (3153/ 9621) 
 And I understand that mentality now because I went back, but I'll tell you the reason I left was, it sounds stupid, but he took my teddy bear, which I loved and I've had for, not since I was a child, but at least five years at that time. And he just, he knew I loved it. 

Recording: (3154/ 9621) 
 that is going to, well, it might make national news. I just. 

Recording: (3155/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3156/ 9621) 
 You were past ready. Yeah. 

Recording: (3157/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

 Well, I mean, I wouldn't I wouldn't say it was an hour at a time. But yeah, and he loves playing on the computer, doing CD ROMs and loves watching the Magic School Bus. 

Recording: (3159/ 9621) 
 Oh, because I was going to say, when you're talking about traveling, you'll be able to get him to have a job where he can do lots of traveling. I know I'm like, my husband goes to Europe and goes to California every month. And he goes as little as possible. But the point is, if we wanted to be traveling, he could be going a lot more, a lot longer. Now he just goes for a couple days time just to get back here because I don't like him to have to go. He doesn't want to be away from us. But your husband, you'll be in a position, he can latch onto something where you'll be able to have lots of opportunities to travel.

 Sort of make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do or they wanted to go with it 

Recording: (3162/ 9621) 
 No, I worked at the library when I was a student. 

Recording: (3163/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3164/ 9621)

Recording: (3165/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3166/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. Is that Silicon Valley? 

Recording: (3167/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he is. 

Recording: (3168/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (3169/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3170/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, it's right around here. 

Recording: (3171/ 9621) 
 Yes, I just don't, I'm not comfortable with another man being around my son like that. So, I mean, if I dated, I mean, you know, I'm just taking it. I just, I don't know. I haven't felt, I've went out a couple times, but I won't let it get serious or, you know, no same night, nothing like that goes on. 

Recording: (3172/ 9621) 
 But then he disowned me so it doesn't matter. 

Recording: (3173/ 9621) 
 you. 

Recording: (3174/ 9621) 
 The simplest things. 

Recording: (3175/ 9621) 
 Well, we figure in a few years he will. 

Recording: (3176/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3177/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3178/ 9621) 
 Well, I think they tried to get some kind of a deal with when they were planning this thing with with the high state to You know like had the shot stain Center down at Down closer to downtown or or something like and play happier ball games there or something like that But but I don't need that, you know, they got their own stuff so 

Recording: (3179/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3180/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't think they should be responsible. I think kids go to school and they need role models, good teachers. And I think schools have gotten a lot better about that. It seemed like in the late 80s, early 90s, you know, the schools, a lot of them were really bad. I think finally the education department or whatever is realizing that parents need help with their kids. They can't do everything and they just need really positive things when they do go to school. And I think teachers are a big part of it. I really do. You remember when you have a good teacher and that you've learned a lot. And I think through education, because it's hard, all these schools in so many rural areas and everything try to get good teachers and then, you know, it's always has to do with money and them not making enough money, which the teachers don't make enough money. And they're overworked in all these big large classrooms. It just seems to me when kids start dressing and getting in a clique together, you know, it'd be hard for them to intervene and say, oh, what's going on in your life? What's your, what's the problem? You know, that's, that's not really, should be their role. But if they care enough, they should call their parents and say, look, we're worried about your son. He misses a lot of school or he's starting to dress really, you know. Sometimes, and it shouldn't be that dress has a lot to do with it, but it seems when kids go a different way, it does involve dress and just, you know, turning against the norm of the society, you know. And if they don't want to be in sports, that's fine. There's so many different things that they can do in school and learn about arts and music and, you know, but unfortunately, I think a lot more pressure is on schools to more or less pick up the slack of what the parents can't do. But in some ways it's always kind of been like that. I mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home. You know I mean 

Recording: (3181/ 9621) 
 getting so congested, that's what I don't like. 

Recording: (3182/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3183/ 9621) 
 And it's like, I like how, it's like I thought about going to Antioch, but it was really expensive and like, I don't know, but just because it's in schools, more of a non-traditional type where they give you like evaluations and you don't get grades. So then that's what I heard, it's like in Antioch where the professor writes a couple page paper on your performance on the quarter. And that really shows that, I mean, that's a lot of work work for the professor, but that really shows that he's really involved in noticing what you're doing as opposed to just some kid in his class. 

Recording: (3184/ 9621) 
 Well, there's been quite a change in the attitude of the general public, I think, as far as women working away from home is concerned. And I don't know. I'm glad that my wife was able to work there at home. Well, actually, she worked in an office when our first boy was just small. 

Recording: (3185/ 9621) 
 Well, in 

Recording: (3186/ 9621) 
 You know 

Recording: (3187/ 9621) 
 No, it's not. 

Recording: (3188/ 9621) 
 Most of my paintings are of images from Star Wars. 

Recording: (3189/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they had those back when I was a teen. They wanted to send me to one of those. My father wouldn't allow it because it was integrated. 

Recording: (3190/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (3191/ 9621) 
 There's a mild fear. It seems that cops always 

Recording: (3192/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (3193/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I could. 

Recording: (3194/ 9621) 
 It is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago. 

Recording: (3195/ 9621) 
 And I tell them, writing is not an event. It's a process. It's like getting your braces put on. You go in one time, and they might pull a couple teeth. And you go in the next time, they might put that little wire on. And you go in the next time, they might put the lower ones on, or part of them. And the next time, then they put on more. And then one time, they'll tighten them a little. But it's a process that happens over a period of three years. It's not an event. They think they can sit down and write, okay, I'm done. I'm like, I don't think so. Writing is a process. 

Recording: (3196/ 9621) 
 For the medical insurance. 

Recording: (3197/ 9621) 
 But it's like a democracy over there in Australia. They don't have a king and queen. 

Recording: (3198/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (3199/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and there's a certain amount of gun laws that I actually didn't get into until I saw that. Here in Ohio, it's with a long gun or a handgun, you have to be 18. But other places like Texas, there's no minimum age on owning a rifle or a handgun. You're looking like, God, man, you pack, just imagine this little six year old walking into the store packing. Oh, man. 

Recording: (3200/ 9621) 
 I do. 

Recording: (3201/ 9621) 
 Afraid we're gonna get them addicted to the internet or something The Nintendo and those type of things are bad enough. They're a good babysitter, but you need to limit it

 Columbus public. 

Recording: (3203/ 9621) 
 you. 

Recording: (3204/ 9621) 
 By the end I was pretty much just puking up blood and passing out a lot. 

Recording: (3205/ 9621) 
 Before that I worked at Channel 4 TV station for about five years. 

Recording: (3206/ 9621) 
 Or been around, but I think doctors should more look on that avenue, that possibly it's something else like that. I've never had a doctor, well, now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you if you know about allergies and usually it's prescriptions and things that you've taken. But I don't know, I think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore, I really do. 

Recording: (3207/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (3208/ 9621) 
 OK, now I have Dover, ferry to Bruges, Belgium, and then train. 

Recording: (3209/ 9621) 
 I was born in Columbus. I'm 27. Graduated from Ohio State. 

Recording: (3210/ 9621) 
 He never said a thing again. Like, okay, we went for the big bucks. We went for the time off. Everybody makes their choices. Now you got to live with them. 

Recording: (3211/ 9621) 
 Politics, I mean, we grew up, or came of age after the Cold War was over. I'm very cynical about this. I have a fairly leftist political stance. 

Recording: (3212/ 9621) 
 It is, but that was good for New Albany to have that. I mean, I think it was great to have it there. And I think a lot of people did enjoy going there, because there's not very many women's tournaments that come around here. 

Recording: (3213/ 9621) 
 She would pamper the kids. And well, from where we lived, we lived just off, I don't know whether you're acquainted with the north end of Columbus, but anyway, Indianola Avenue is one of the main thoroughfares. And we lived about a block and a half off of Indianola. And then just another block was a small shopping center where there was a drugstore and a barber shop and a Tencent store, theater, I forget, a couple other shops. And when Orin was about, I don't know, five or maybe six or seven years old. He had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there at all. So one day, Grandma gave him, I don't know, a quarter or something. And that burned his pocket till, I don't know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or whether he went up on his own, but he went up to the store. And I think, I don't know whether Mary went up and got him or what. Anyway, she found out he was up there. So when I came home, she told me what had happened. I said, well, that just can't be. So I took him downstairs and paddled him. There had never been anything more said about it since then. 

Recording: (3214/ 9621) 
 It behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings. So I mean, there's, I mean, yeah, the animal therapy is a very good thing. My dog has been very supportive and very, you know, like you said, the unconditional love part, you know, I mean, how you could, you could, you could leave for a week and come back and they're, they're like, okay. I'm glad you're back, you know. 

Recording: (3215/ 9621) 
 I didn't quite understand or hear you. 

Recording: (3216/ 9621) 
 Because I like Johnstown better if you really want to know but there ain't many places to fish up there. Well is that good enough? 

Recording: (3217/ 9621) 
 I love that. 

Recording: (3218/ 9621) 
 I was thinking about putting my life on book, but I don't think they make that many pages. I have a 20,000 page book. 10,000 would be introduction. Well, it all started. 

Recording: (3219/ 9621) 
 I wasn't born here, but I was raised here. 

Recording: (3220/ 9621) 
 So that's basically what we've been doing. We've been progressing for 15 years and I'm proud to say that our state agency is probably the only agency other than maybe this Highway Patrol. We work a lot with them. But I think we're the only ones that have their own wiring cable people. 

Recording: (3221/ 9621) 
 or grow up and discover boys, either way. 

Recording: (3222/ 9621) 
 I mean, you kind of suffer your own consequences more rather than having society like yell at you for it. 

Recording: (3223/ 9621) 
 See you in smallpox. 

Recording: (3224/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (3225/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (3226/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3227/ 9621) 
 Saw a lot of stuff like that and met a lot of people. 

Recording: (3228/ 9621) 
 And if I was in the same situation, I'd be doing the same thing. 

Recording: (3229/ 9621) 
 इह हूँ 

Recording: (3230/ 9621) 
 I think it was more just a family preference. I preferred family. 

Recording: (3231/ 9621) 
 And that was pretty done. 

Recording: (3232/ 9621) 
 Gear your writing for a fourth grader and everyone will, that you, everybody that's going to read the memo will be able to read it. 

Recording: (3233/ 9621) 
 No, it didn't. As a matter of fact, I told my parents, you know, the university is handling it so well by not giving them the money because they don't deserve it. 

Recording: (3234/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3235/ 9621) 
 Merde ! 

Recording: (3236/ 9621) 
 It's a lot of memories. 

Recording: (3237/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3238/ 9621) 
 No, no it doesn't. 

Recording: (3239/ 9621) 
 So it's like in the parks, you know, like in Grand Canyon, you can feed them, you know, like junk food and McDonald's. 

Recording: (3240/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he says a lot of racial slurs like that. He's really homophobic. 

Recording: (3241/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I thought that was interesting. So it is a values, you know, the Christian values thing. I don't have a problem with it. We had little problems like my son had to learn the Hail Mary and we had to find somebody to teach it to us, write it down for us because we didn't know and they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marks off. And we didn't know, yeah, little things like that. But it wasn't a problem. There was a problem with my son for a while because the priest they had there wouldn't let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion. And that's pretty much the priest decides that. And he felt singled out. And he was. I mean, he was the only one. And he was uncomfortable with that. But it hasn't been a problem. I'm not a religious person myself but I'm not against it. And maybe I've justified it to myself by saying, well, they're teaching values. 

Recording: (3242/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3243/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (3244/ 9621) 
 Although, Janet, you just said yesterday that people are so overweight in Columbus because there's not very much to do, that actually 

Recording: (3245/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and because I, back when I was in high school in my AP government class, I was paying attention a lot. You know, like I read the Columbus Dispatch every day and I read U.S. News and World Report for my economics class and I was totally caught up with everything. 

Recording: (3246/ 9621) 
 Did you teach at a university level? 

Recording: (3247/ 9621) 
 Well, I know about the gorilla masks and, you know, it's a women's organization to promote women artists and to object to the male hierarchy, you know, that only men are in the museums and only men get the big gallery shows and stuff like that. 

Recording: (3248/ 9621) 
 If you got an eight inch barrel on your gun, now you tell me where you're going to put it. 

Recording: (3249/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3250/ 9621) 
 I think I'm going to, I really like the riser military because it shows discipline, responsibility, respect. You go to a Columbus public school and the kids will lash out on substitute teachers. I think it's really crazy. I think you should have a lot more respect for your elders, your adults. 

Recording: (3251/ 9621) 
 And he let me fire at one range, but I got about 50 or 75 yards from what we were shooting at. 

Recording: (3252/ 9621) 
 I'll place on some land with woods and yeah, water, things like that. 

Recording: (3253/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. I have no idea. 

Recording: (3254/ 9621) 
 And that's essentially what the Supreme Court said in their last decision on this two, three years ago. What they said was whether we think it's right or wrong, whether we think the previous Supreme Court was right or wrong, it's been a part of this fabric of this country for more than 10 years, and to reverse it would create too much, too many problems for people, you know, which I thought was a nice way of saying, sorry, folks, but, you know, it's too late. 

Recording: (3255/ 9621) 
 I don't know. Maybe, I think, maybe if teachers just, their status in society isn't real high when it should be, it's more, I mean, I've heard that garbage men get paid more than teachers, you know, and how, but it, so it's just like, people always talk about education for the, you know, we gotta think about our child's future or whatever, but really teachers are paid crap and don't really get a lot of respect from anybody. Professors and stuff get more of a respect, but it's just the teachers that you have, especially in elementary school, in critical periods in your life, especially in adolescence, too, really influence how you are as a person. People don't take that for granted a lot. If you have bad teachers in one subject, you're going to hate that subject. If you have good teachers, you're going to love it. It really influences what you want to do with your life and people don't really acknowledge that too much. 

Recording: (3256/ 9621) 
 Kind of. I mean it was something I was really into until, I don't know, maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which point things sort of switched to, you know, like, I don't know, like killer robots or something, like Transformers, that kind of thing. In high school, I don't know, I think I cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys. I'm like, Star Wars is fun. I'm gonna watch Star Wars more often. I had them on tape, so I started watching them and got, I don't wanna say into it, because I know people who are really into it. I'm pretty into it, but it's not the same kind of thing, I don't think. But back when I started doing the painting, I graduated from high school in 94, just to put things in a little perspective. So it was my first couple years of college. From the second half of high school to my first couple years of college, I just sort of... I don't know, I like the story. 

Recording: (3257/ 9621) 
 because they kicked me out for some dumb reason. They confused me with somebody else and I ended up taking the blame. 

Recording: (3258/ 9621) 
 You get priority for scheduling. You have to apply for it like separately and I think you have to have like certain Class standing and SAT scores or you can write an essay and they'll let you in anyway Let's see You get priority for scheduling. I think you go after varsity athletes and disabilities and that's it 

Recording: (3259/ 9621) 
 No, because honestly like, Gore to me is like a best out of a bad bunch. Like if I have to choose, I'll choose Gore. But that doesn't mean I necessarily like, he's most in line with a lot of my stuff, with a lot of my views. Don't get me wrong, I'm not completely liberal on everything. Like there's certain things, I guess maybe because going to school in Ashland, it just rubs off on you. There's certain things like I'm not so liberal about, but I don really, like Gorgeous seems so dry and just not, it's hard to, I think it'd be hard to get people enthusiastic for him. 

Recording: (3260/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3261/ 9621) 
 And he does have a responsibility, but I think there could be a line drawn to how responsible he is and how capable the other half would have been, you know. 

Recording: (3262/ 9621) 
 because the mother he played her because he was with me and you know if and she just was like forget him I don't want him to be around my child and the other one she's older she's they she's like 10 and he says that because his daughter don't call you like she only calls for when she wants things so he doesn't you know he'll get whatever he can for when she calls but he doesn't spend time with her 

Recording: (3263/ 9621) 
 I have, you know, there are kids in the neighborhood and the grownups talk and I talk to the kids too. There's a girl that lives next door, we talk a lot. She just started at Everett, the arts middle school. 

Recording: (3264/ 9621) 
 he admits now that he felt neglected at that period. 

Recording: (3265/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, it is. I think it's tough, and I think it's really an individual basis. But I would say that there's a lot of other things that would contribute more to any societal problems than divorce. I really don't think that that would be the main. 

Recording: (3266/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (3267/ 9621) 
 plays and just things that are different. My sociology and psychology teacher, he was the same guy that taught history, and he was real good too. It was really crazy, obviously, but it's just interesting, the sociology of high school and having a sociology class about it.

 the

 into the hilltop area. 

Recording: (3270/ 9621) 
 I keep thinking, I want to go back and take some classes. I keep thinking I'd go back to school, but I can't even narrow down what I would want to take. There's so much stuff, or so many areas that are interesting to me. 

Recording: (3271/ 9621) 
 Maybe. 

Recording: (3272/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3273/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3274/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure yet. At least based on money raised, it looks like George W. could trample almost anybody. But George W. hadn't gotten out there in the fray yet and given too many answers to issues. He talks about compassionate conservatism, and I don't know what that means. I want answers to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean, but I don't think that I'm average in that I don't go for the slick image, it bothers me. He has the potential of trampling Gore. I think that Gore will be the nominee no matter what Bradley does. Gore has it sewn up because he's the insider. 

Recording: (3275/ 9621) 
 Oh, I was going to say it would be interesting. 

Recording: (3276/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3277/ 9621) 
 As far as I know, she was planning on going to St. Louis University, which I wanted to go to the University of Missouri. 

Recording: (3278/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they only have like a couple days in each city. That's not much. I like going someplace and spending a week and just exploring. 

Recording: (3279/ 9621) 
 but there were one or two eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put hours worth of research into and sketch and it was just 

Recording: (3280/ 9621) 
 I don't like W. I don't, I don't, I mean, I, my, I guess my mom was a Democrat and my dad was a Republican. 

Recording: (3281/ 9621) 
 In most school districts it's comparable to any other job now. It used to always be low, but like a beginning teacher in Worthington starts at I think 26.8 or something. Of course, Worthington's one of the three highest paid districts in Ohio, but it used to be that teachers just got paid lower than a starting fireman or a starting policeman. You know, in a sense, you're out there risking your life every day, too. 

Recording: (3282/ 9621) 
 You know, guards up there looking down. The watchtowers, yeah. You could feel it. And to see it different is really cool. You can look it up and say, has anybody got their sights on me? Yeah. Yeah. Because that's like the World War II stuff. There's like remains, I'm sure. But it's like, if you get to see the wall, it's like there. I mean, I'm sure there's like there's, from what I understand, it was like, you know, that's like the World War II stuff. You know, there's like remains, I'm sure. It's like, you get to see the wall. It's like, I'm sure there's like, from what I understand, it was like, you know, concertina wire and barbed wire and all those, like a big, big brick wall and whatever. You can actually, you know, still see it unless they tore it down. Okay. Just like to preserve the history of it, okay. Wow. So you actually, it's neat, like because you were like a part of that history, at least when you were over there you feel like, wow, I was, you know, something to tell your daughter, who's like, I was there. She goes Scotland See now I'm like I'm like depressed because like man I guess I gave you a few months here now I want to just get you know, it's like when you get psyched up I Haven't decided okay, because I for a while? Yeah, there's a lot of places to teach English overseas. I might not be coming back anytime soon. Really? Not in Australia, they have it pretty a native speaker. And apparently people have gone there and made just lots of money. They teach a lot, they make tons of money, save it all, and then they go travel again. And then after the money runs out, they come back and then start up teaching. Wow, that's fantastic. So that's not a thing you don't have to have. You have to have a doctorate or any sort of credentials whatsoever, as long as you can talk the talk. Yeah, if you have a master's, they'll pay you more. But usually, you get a master's in English teaching, it costs a lot of money. But they'll hire people as long as you speak English. Really? They'll teach you the teaching part. They'll give you materials. Well, they wouldn't put you in front of a 250-person lecture hall, would they? Well, I don't know how to teach it, but I would have a teacher class or another language class. That would be hard. That would be a challenge. So yeah, it's not a shame. They're going to be like Spanish instructors. No, I never thought about that. some people studying Spanish? into like teaching classes. But I was like, well, I didn't know if that was like true or not, that you can actually teach around the world. Because I've heard stories, you know, yeah, you can, people will pay. I'm like, but why? But it's like, yeah,, like a 40 hour week, where you'd be... Okay. Okay. So you think it's just like one on one where you just like sit like us doing, or it's like in a classroom setting, you just have like a group conversation? Okay. Okay. So there's definitely work available if you want to pursue it. Did you visit Spain while you were there? Because that's one of the places I want to

 And socially too. I mean, mostly ADHD and LD kids are emotionally immature as well. So like the songs that their friends are listening to and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they're still acting like a fifth grader. You know, they're not interested in girls and they're still listening to music that younger kids would like. They're just generally socially they mature a little slower. It takes them longer to catch up. 

Recording: (3284/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I shouldn't have to do this. I'm the responsible for the happiness of this family. 

Recording: (3285/ 9621) 
 So she does not want to take the baby home. So they're arranging some other things. We have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time, but we think that's going to be too hard for us. 

Recording: (3286/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3287/ 9621) 
 That's 

Recording: (3288/ 9621) 
 Not really. 

Recording: (3289/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, all the time. 

Recording: (3290/ 9621) 
 brother 

Recording: (3291/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3292/ 9621) 
 you know, do the screening. 

Recording: (3293/ 9621) 
 They have the gay pride parade and everything, which is good. They should be able to. 

Recording: (3294/ 9621) 
 There's no doubt in my mind that he heard those voices. Now whether they were actual audible voices or whether they were voices from the inside. 

Recording: (3295/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3296/ 9621) 
 If you read it to yourself out loud, like if you're in a room by yourself and you read out loud, do you remember it better than if you read it silently? If you hear yourself say the words. 

Recording: (3297/ 9621) 
 you know, mixed race or handicapped or, you know, hard to place. 

Recording: (3298/ 9621) 
 It's really new, isn also it's directed towards businesses. It's NT technology, which is designed for network businesses and Well, anyways, it's got a different file structure format than Windows 98 it runs it runs on NTSF and fat 32 and I have to switch it back to fat 16 and I can't get the partitioning right for my for drive because FAT16 can't handle anything above 2 gigs for the primary drive and my drive is a 10 gig drive so I have to partition it and I can't figure out how to get silly thing partitioned because every time I try and work around and make a partition through F disk I get these really wacky errors everything gets transferred over to D drive and I have no more C drive. It's gone. I don't know where it vanishes to. It is. No, and I can't do a stinking thing on my computer. I have to use all the other guys' computers in my house. 

Recording: (3299/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we do a lot of interlibrary loan, too. 

Recording: (3300/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3301/ 9621) 
 I ended up running away from home. 

Recording: (3302/ 9621) 
 At the end of March I go to Europe and I travel around for a minimum of 100 days with a backpack on my back. 

Recording: (3303/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3304/ 9621) 
 They didn't know. 

Recording: (3305/ 9621) 
 I wouldn't. 

Recording: (3306/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3307/ 9621) 
 See, that's the difference. Worthington has a program for them. One of the women that I worked with, she was having so many problems similar to mine when her son was in Columbus schools. And she moved to Westerville, and they put him in a class for that, and it took care of it. 

Recording: (3308/ 9621) 
 And whenever you have a heart attack anymore, they always suspect coke is the first thing. 

Recording: (3309/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (3310/ 9621) 
 Where you from? 

Recording: (3311/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3312/ 9621) 
 And, well, actually, a neighbor boy whose draft number was smaller than mine, 

Recording: (3313/ 9621) 
 So 

Recording: (3314/ 9621) 
 Yeah, unfortunately. Well, some people have to. I mean, you know, the police officers and whatnot, they are required to carry a gun. But almost every kid I know that has had a gun, even if they keep a gun hidden here and the bullets hidden over here, 

Recording: (3315/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but guns are always gonna be around, you ain't gonna get rid of them. 

Recording: (3316/ 9621) 
 And your display might be different, but it's basic information. And we developed a system that people started doing that on and sharing the data. Actually, it started here on NSU campus, and now we're independent. 

Recording: (3317/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (3318/ 9621) 
 Legal is better. 

Recording: (3319/ 9621) 
 You look forward to coming home and the pet's waiting on you. 

Recording: (3320/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well... 

Recording: (3321/ 9621) 
 Chantalou helped. 

Recording: (3322/ 9621) 
 Mmm, yeah. 

Recording: (3323/ 9621) 
 and I like painting. 

Recording: (3324/ 9621) 
 You don't slide as much. 

Recording: (3325/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3326/ 9621) 
 they're confused. I don't know that saying home is for everyone and I don't think parenting is for everyone. And it really makes me sad when I see somebody you know we just want our 

Recording: (3327/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (3328/ 9621) 
 I didn't want to go to Dallas. 

Recording: (3329/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they've gone to town. So are you in the baby boomer generation? I'm not really. No, I was born in 58. So I was past it. My sister's more of a baby boomer. Yeah. Yeah. I'm 42. 

Recording: (3330/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. Yeah. Grand Cayman. 

Recording: (3331/ 9621) 
 Ah. 

Recording: (3332/ 9621) 
 Huh. 

Recording: (3333/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3334/ 9621) 
 Oh, yes. 

Recording: (3335/ 9621) 
 And that's just. 

Recording: (3336/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because I've thought about that. Like, well, maybe I'll just wait a few years and start dating. 

Recording: (3337/ 9621) 
 I'm out. 

Recording: (3338/ 9621) 
 Walk us all the way through the hospital. 

Recording: (3339/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3340/ 9621) 
 to beat them up. 

Recording: (3341/ 9621) 
 Right, you don't. 

Recording: (3342/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (3343/ 9621) 
 Oh, they I do. 

Recording: (3344/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3345/ 9621) 
 I know. Well, when you become a mother, you tend to ignore things too. 

Recording: (3346/ 9621) 
 Well, nowadays, I grew up, my dad hunted and everything, so we always had guns in the house and everything, but I would no more go near one unless he was around because I was told not to. And they always used to say, if you stop letting normal people get a gun, then the criminals will always have the gun. Well, obviously that's not true, you know. My personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms. If you're a political agent or anything, I'm not really sure the background checks really do that great of a job. 

Recording: (3347/ 9621) 
 He was tough, but he was always tough. And we didn't realize it for years. We didn't have anything to compare it to. He's the only one kid we got. The psychologist told us that we were talking about things that happened when he was growing up. He said, you must have had a terrible time growing up raising him because he was not an easy kid. We didn't know any different. 

Recording: (3348/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3349/ 9621) 
 There's not a lot of phone to do. Mainly it's computer processing, running reports and stuff. 

Recording: (3350/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3351/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (3352/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3353/ 9621) 
 mhm 

Recording: (3354/ 9621) 
 Prague, Czech Republic, Budapest. 

Recording: (3355/ 9621) 
 And I don't think he really understood that. He might someday. 

Recording: (3356/ 9621) 
 I mean, to me, you're supposed to earn your grade. 

Recording: (3357/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3358/ 9621) 
 Yes, we did just last night. 

Recording: (3359/ 9621) 
 My parents are all for it. They've always been supportive of whatever we wanted. 

Recording: (3360/ 9621) 
 You live and you learn. 

Recording: (3361/ 9621) 
 Well, that guy who could change form. And in the movie, they're about to kiss. I don't like it when they get that close. I like how their relationship is still professional and they interact with each other on that level first and they're very good friends. And they have that tension, but they don't succumb to it. And I really like it, I just dislike it a little less. 

Recording: (3362/ 9621) 
 I was a sinner. 

Recording: (3363/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3364/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3365/ 9621) 
 Oh, definitely. 

Recording: (3366/ 9621) 
 I'm a veteran so I get points for veterans so you know what I mean? 

Recording: (3367/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3368/ 9621) 
 So... 

Recording: (3369/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was just really disgusting how they behaved and a lot of yelling at students and that was really unnecessary. They just totally approached it from the wrong point and I mean there were some students that actually were supporting them. 

Recording: (3370/ 9621) 
 Yeah, oh and that's good for the baby too. 

Recording: (3371/ 9621) 
 Maybe we're beyond that. We shouldn't always be saying that. 

Recording: (3372/ 9621) 
 That's a thing. But the thing is, some people say, well, why did you do this? The thing is, why don't you talk to those people and say, hey, why not do what I'm doing best? In other words, compliment the team. 

Recording: (3373/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I've been thoroughly spoiled. You know, like, catfish bish subs, those are kinda... 

Recording: (3374/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3375/ 9621) 
 um... there are a lot better there are definitely some there 

Recording: (3376/ 9621) 
 I think it is a good idea because I've won my fair share of money on the lottery. They give everybody a fair chance, you know, they don't just minimize it to one or two. You know, some of them have options and some of them don't. 

Recording: (3377/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3378/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right. 

Recording: (3379/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure. 

Recording: (3380/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3381/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3382/ 9621) 
 Boring. 

Recording: (3383/ 9621) 
 to art, whatever it is, wherever it comes from. And there's not the old boy network, not as much who you know to get into things. Or that women are allowed to know the people that the boys know. So it's not as closed off that way. 

Recording: (3384/ 9621) 
 Westland, that's up in Delaware. And most of them that I talk to, I haven't been there a while, so I haven't really talked to a whole population of students. But the ones I did talk to, even their professor and whatever they're majoring in, he was out hanging out at the bar. He was doing karaoke. Oh, man, you should have saw him do Hang On Sleepy. 

Recording: (3385/ 9621) 
 I was raised in the Sunday school of this church up here. Yeah, so I'm a long time member. And in fact, I think I may be about the longest term member of the choir right now. Yeah. Because I sang in the choir there when I was in high school back in 1970. So it's 30 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. It's it may be getting a little bit more common nowadays, but it's still I think the church gets most of its members from as converts. And recovering, right. Recovering, you name it. Yeah. 

Recording: (3386/ 9621) 
 do is they eat out all the time. We used to be restaurants. I know it. They're incredible. 

Recording: (3387/ 9621) 
 acceptable so. 

Recording: (3388/ 9621) 
 It's pretty far. 

Recording: (3389/ 9621) 
 Oh no. 

Recording: (3390/ 9621) 
 It was all very pro breastfeeding. You could really tell that they had an opinion about this. We talked about positives and negatives of breastfeeding, and things about the immune system. 

Recording: (3391/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and you read it. 

Recording: (3392/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (3393/ 9621) 
 When they're drunk, when's the last time you read about somebody driving the wrong way on a freeway from smoking a joint? 

Recording: (3394/ 9621) 
 No, he didn't even come back. I mean, he came out, but it's like he went the other way. I thought, you know, if he get a big kick out of kicking my skinny little butt, you know, then. 

Recording: (3395/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3396/ 9621) 
 No, no, I think I'm alright. 

Recording: (3397/ 9621) 
 Big ball of fur. Do they have like little babies that carry in their pouches like kangaroos? 

Recording: (3398/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3399/ 9621) 
 Right. Yeah, and my daughter doesn't seem to. 

Recording: (3400/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (3401/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3402/ 9621) 
 Well, I- 

Recording: (3403/ 9621) 
 Exactly. Yeah, you know and you know, it's like I honestly feel the older you get the more you kind of look at what's in there as opposed to you know, gosh, that's just a $400 dress and a $300 hairdo and you know, what does that mean? You know, it's like when we're food for maggots my feeling is Some people are they're gonna say gee she had a really big house and some other people to go, gosh, she did work in this area for free, and she volunteered at this, and she did this, and she did this, and this. And they're going to go, oh. It's like, what do you want at the very end? 

Recording: (3404/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (3405/ 9621) 
 Because I mean that must be how she raised her kids. You know, and she's... That's what I asked her. She's got a husband. I'm like, so your husband, you believe he cheats? Yeah. I don't believe that. I think that's terrible. 

Recording: (3406/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3407/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3408/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3409/ 9621) 
 And then when I went out there, she had security remove me off the premises that following Monday. Because I was supposed to go out and sign something for a lease. Didn't really happen that way. I went and signed it and I came back to school Monday thinking, yeah, well, another day, another dollar, whatever. Get there and they go ahead and out the door. 

Recording: (3410/ 9621) 
 So it's, and sometimes it'll take a while to get your call, what we call your calling, or your call. But then you just, it's exciting to find out where you're gonna go. 

Recording: (3411/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I would say anything outside. I like doing that. 

Recording: (3412/ 9621) 
 and it was suspect, he still ruled in their favor. 

Recording: (3413/ 9621) 
 Just saying stepmother makes me go eee. 

Recording: (3414/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We're crazy. 

Recording: (3415/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3416/ 9621) 
 I said I didn't belong to any groups and that's not true. I belong to Ohio Designer Craftsman. And they took in the shops they try to limit it to Ohio artists. But the membership is national. So it's not really closed. It's just sort of focusing on Ohio. 

Recording: (3417/ 9621) 
 I had a student bring me a paper today. He said, this is for history. I have to write an essay on Anthony Wayne. 

Recording: (3418/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3419/ 9621) 
 we have to pay for the uh... we have a uh... yeah we're paying for it 

Recording: (3420/ 9621) 
 and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right. 

Recording: (3421/ 9621) 
 That's a good system. It was really fascinating too, because I called Microsoft, and it was going to cost me $35 for technical support. I was like, screw that. I was like, screw that, dude. 

Recording: (3422/ 9621) 
 It was a guinea pig type situation. It was probably better in high school. It was more college prep. 

Recording: (3423/ 9621) 
 because she enjoys cooking and makes it a little bit easier. I tend to overcook the meat. 

Recording: (3424/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3425/ 9621) 
 And you know that your parents are not going to say no to you anyways. 

Recording: (3426/ 9621) 
 I think they're both boring. If you look at the image thing, they're both fairly wooden. Neither one of them seems comfortable in front of a camera. It's interesting on Bradley, my boyfriend is big in sports. He's not as liberal as I am. He's a little bit on the conservative side. But he would support Bradley simply because he was a former basketball player. And I'm about ready to say to him at some point in time, you know, if he becomes president, you're going to hate him he Bradley's the more liberal. Gore, I think, understands the need to compromise. But I think Gore will be the candidate. I don't think Bradley will be able to go past all of the work that Gore's been doing for eight years as vice president. 

Recording: (3427/ 9621) 
 Well, see, I'm limited on some of the stuff I like to do. I like to go back into working with my hands and stuff. I used to do maintenance. There ain't nothing I can't fix. 

Recording: (3428/ 9621) 
 Yeah, just to watch people go, what do you just do that for? And I'm like, and what grade are you in? 

Recording: (3429/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3430/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3431/ 9621) 
 Oh, it can be, yeah. 

Recording: (3432/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (3433/ 9621) 
 that often. They do, but there's just not near as many of them. I can count on one hand the number of men teachers I've known over the years in elementary ed, practically. You know, five, maybe six. That's probably why the boys don't, you know, yeah. 

Recording: (3434/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (3435/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3436/ 9621) 
 Hmm 

Recording: (3437/ 9621) 
 I mean, we'd be 70 years old when the kid graduates from high school. And that wouldn't be fair to the kid. And we were doing it for the wrong reasons, too. So we talked about it, decided it wasn't a good idea. 

Recording: (3438/ 9621) 
 You would think by now, you know, this wouldn't matter. 

Recording: (3439/ 9621) 
 nurse bringer some of the things he has on there some of the people I think they ought to arrest him for a blend of show him on TV 

Recording: (3440/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3441/ 9621) 
 아... 

Recording: (3442/ 9621) 
 That's that, whatever they call it, 33 that's on the ballot. 

Recording: (3443/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3444/ 9621) 
 Fuck! 

Recording: (3445/ 9621) 
 never in Alaska or Hawaii, but for all. 

Recording: (3446/ 9621) 
 broke the strike. If you're part of the union and you just decided to go back and say forget it, they can't pay you. And I don't see too many people working for free. 

Recording: (3447/ 9621) 
 Two and a half. 

Recording: (3448/ 9621) 
 They have 

Recording: (3449/ 9621) 
 Yeah, then it's come home, you know. Then it's come home to the... And it's so different. I don't know, it's just the motherly thing. The kids just, you know, they draw to their mothers. 

Recording: (3450/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3451/ 9621) 
 That's really hard to say. If she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran, negatives don't work in Columbus. Columbus really does have a heart and that just doesn't play in Columbus. What plays in the state and the people who ran her campaign ran Voinovich's campaign and Betty Montgomery's campaign and that negative stuff worked statewide. It doesn't work so well in Columbus. I think even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost. And I like to think that age doesn't matter, but she came across as old to me also. And I like to think I'm not prejudiced on any issue, but if there's someone who had been right on on the issues I don't care if she was old I would have voted for her. She just didn't support the issues I supported. She was wrong on, I didn't like that she tried to use the police chief in such a negative way by saying that Coleman had voted for a raise for the chief. Well yes he voted for a raise for a chief, but he voted for a raise for the police officers. It's just that, you know, the police chief was tied to his. And I don't like people who try to manipulate facts. And that was manipulating the facts. I didn't like that she was against the TIF in Polaris. Once it was voted, I thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong wrong and I don't think it was wrong to begin with, but once it was voted and in place I thought her reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected didn't sit well with me. So I don't even if she had a lot of charisma, charisma doesn't mean as much to me as a person's standard 

Recording: (3452/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (3453/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and as I got older, I continued to lose interest in it. 

Recording: (3454/ 9621) 
 Yeah, his mom couldn't take care of him anymore. And he was like, I think he was about 14 and he just, he didn't have really anywhere to go. And luckily this families had taken his different siblings, different families took him. I don't know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families that took care of him. But it was good for him because he's got that example. 

Recording: (3455/ 9621) 
 Well, you got the casinos, riverboat casinos open, you got all the, pretty much every store on the corner's got a lottery machine or tickets. 

Recording: (3456/ 9621) 
 If you do that to ten things, it's integral to the university's collection. It really hits your budget. And then there's always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it. 

Recording: (3457/ 9621) 
 About the same number. 

Recording: (3458/ 9621) 
 to our society. Now we bow to him. 

Recording: (3459/ 9621) 
 mother's mother and her sister would be my aunt. She was a caretaking so my mother came here for that reason and they just stayed. 

Recording: (3460/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (3461/ 9621) 
 Well, all together, I started in 91. 

Recording: (3462/ 9621) 
 So... 

Recording: (3463/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (3464/ 9621) 
 Bye! 

Recording: (3465/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we have a little kitchen.

 I help Janet somewhat, but not a whole lot. I have a project I work on, not as much as I probably should, but it's the Swan Cleaners project. And what we do, we have little houses, donation boxes in all the Swan Cleaners. And there's probably about, probably a good 40, 45 of those throughout the city. So I'm in charge of that. And I do some volunteer there. That's for the benefit of the Homeless Families Foundation. And other than that, I just do housewife-y things. It's the first I've been retired since last March. So I'm adjusting to being home and not being so, yeah, really. And I have to work at that because I've been so busy for the last 25 years. Yes, makes it hard. 

Recording: (3467/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3468/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3469/ 9621) 
 But it's Constitution and stuff like that. They always bring it back. Our forefathers did this and our forefathers did that. Our forefathers also were squatters. Does that mean I can move into this room? 

Recording: (3470/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, you get a lot of those. 

Recording: (3471/ 9621) 
 things. Yeah, just keeping my GPA up enough. 

Recording: (3472/ 9621) 
 Very boring. 

Recording: (3473/ 9621) 
 Sounds good. 

Recording: (3474/ 9621) 
 Um...

Recording: (3477/ 9621) 
 Excuse me. 

Recording: (3478/ 9621) 
 What the fuck? 

Recording: (3479/ 9621) 
 The naked weather girl, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (3480/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3481/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (3482/ 9621) 
 I wasn't gay. But you know what I mean? I could care less about gay people. Like I said, that was the way I was raised. 

Recording: (3483/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I bet you, I'm sure those kids probably had problems. Because I mean, I was like the very, I was a very depressed kid too when I was a teenager. Like always wanted to kill myself and stuff. You know, I just, maybe, I'm not sure because I don't know how their parents were. It could have been, could have been the people they were hanging around that you, you know. 

Recording: (3484/ 9621) 
 So... 

Recording: (3485/ 9621) 
 And actually, in order to get in my room, you have to be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid. In other words, the way you qualify in the state of Ohio is you have a 30-point discrepancy between your actual IQ and your daily performance. In other words, let's say you have 100 IQ, but in all of your classes, you're performing like a 70 IQ person would. So if there's a 30-point discrepancy in there and people see that you're bright but yet you're just not getting it, you're not able to write answers like you could say, or you're not able to read things that other 7th graders can read, that kind of clues us in and then the regular ed or somebody refers the child for testing. And then if they qualify for help, then we, you know, they go to my room for certain classes. Most of my kids, I have them for reading and English. 

Recording: (3486/ 9621) 
 They had one I was just heard news this morning they were talking about some guy who's like 77 years old for Kenyon College or something was throwing erasers at there 

Recording: (3487/ 9621) 
 Yeah, Ohio State is a really good medical school. I don't know. I think they just mainly didn't want to go to OSU, like their egos or something. I'm thinking of one in particular, rich parents just wanted to go somewhere else. 

Recording: (3488/ 9621) 
 They just got different beliefs. She believes I mean like one thing she believes all men will cheat 

Recording: (3489/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (3490/ 9621) 
 So do you hate Microsoft now? I mean there are operating systems that people haven't even heard of that were the thing in their days. I mean a lot of people know what a Commodore 64 is. They've heard of it. But they really don't know what a brilliant system it was at its initial stage. And it just got bowled over because, you know, something better came out. Something better will come out than Windows. Microsoft will eventually go under. It's just going to take a while. Oh yeah. I give it probably about six or seven years before somebody comes out with a system that's just as good as Microsoft. Do you think Linux is going to? Linux? I don't know. I think Linux will be around forever. Just because it's such a stable system. It's a no a lot. Yeah, it seems like it didn't do as good as nearly as good as they thought it was gonna do if it did Okay, it's still around. It just didn't do as good as I thought it was gonna do Dumb morons what idiot doesn't put a three and a half drive on hell. It's so slow. I got a micron I bought the computer from micron and my motherboard sound card video card all of my network cards the case the only thing anymore that is original is the hard drive, the CD-ROM, the 3.5, the 128MB RAM chip, and the CPU. It's the only thing that's factory anymore. No, they probably wouldn't. So what are your plans for the future? Going business for yourself? contact with a day trading firm down in West Virginia and they're starting an intern program sometime, I don't even know when, but if that opens up, I will probably seriously consider going down to West Virginia. They're in Richmond, West Virginia, Richmond. I've been saying West Virginia, haven't I? They're in Virginia, sorry. Their home base is in Richmond, Virginia. Is there a Richmond in Virginia? Okay, their home base is in Richmond, Virginia. Is there a Richmond in Virginia? Okay. Their home base is in Richmond, Virginia. And if they open up the intern program, like I'm hoping they will, then I'll go down there and join the intern program, because I would love to learn how to day trade. I've always been good with stocks. I've always been good with them. But where am I going in the future? I don't know. I know eventually I'm going to go back to law school and get a law interesting. Would you be interested in trial stuff? I don't know. Trial stuff. I also wouldn't mind doing, since I'll have a business degree, I wouldn't mind doing some sort of financial laws stuff. Like being a lawyer for somebody who wants to sue the crap out of another corporation. Oh, plenty of money in that. I don't want to be an ambulance chaser. I just want to be somebody who helps screw all the big giants. One giant wants to beat the crap out of the other giant. 

Recording: (3491/ 9621) 
 But that's what they go through. 

Recording: (3492/ 9621) 
 Well, I didn't necessarily want to, but that's where my family started me out. They are alternative to the public schools, supposedly just more, I don't know exactly how to explain it. The only thing that I know is that I never learned to do anything. 

Recording: (3493/ 9621) 
 Not to sound like a broken record, but I really think it's our backslide on family units. I think it's too easy to stay, and I've been married and divorced, so I've unfortunately had that experience to me, that it's too easy to get divorced. People don't really go into marriage with commitment and lifetime and have that, I don't want to say old-fashioned values, but just the value of this is very important. Because let's face it, to me love is a choice because there's times when I don't love my husband. I want to smack him and he's being a little Barney. But I choose to be in love with him because I made that choice and then that passes and lo and behold an hour later, a week later, whatever it takes, I'm in love with him again. I mean really, you know what I'm saying. And I think it's just too easy to get divorced. I don't believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of the children. But I think if you really make that commitment and actually work on it, you can have a great relationship, you can have kids, and bring them up in a more stable environment. Unfortunately, I think that's the problem. Parents are A, either getting divorced, and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other, you know, using the kid as a medium or they're too selfish and don't listen to their kids or they didn't, I don't want to say selfish, but let's face it, like we said, you know, even having a dog take some time out of your schedule. And not spending enough time with the kids, they're working, whatnot, and it takes a lot of effort to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them and let them grow and things like that. And I don't think enough families are doing that. 

Recording: (3494/ 9621) 
 No, I don't work for politics. 

Recording: (3495/ 9621) 
 So I gave myself a long weekend. Yeah, it is. I wish I'd been last weekend. It was real nice last weekend. So I gave myself a long weekend and just catch up. Sleep a little bit, run around. My daughter's getting ready to go to Italy, so that's... 

Recording: (3496/ 9621) 
 to help calm them down. 

Recording: (3497/ 9621) 
 They try to limit the

 Money's not everything. It's too bad sports have ended up this way. 

Recording: (3499/ 9621) 
 or on your hard drive, because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft. Or I'll say to my students, have your mom look it over, have your sister look it over, have somebody else proofread it, because you're not going to see the mistakes, because you're too busy thinking about the content of what you wanted to say. And you're not going to notice them spelled T-H-I-M, or they T-H-A-Y. Yeah, or a sentence that's too long or a sentence that's a fragment and it isn't a complete thought. You're not going to notice that because you know what it was supposed to say. So give it to a friend or somebody and let them just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they don't understand and that will really help you. Oh, well I had a 

Recording: (3500/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I guess so. I mean, people spend hours on computers doing this type of thing. Let's go down there and see what they can find. 

Recording: (3501/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3502/ 9621) 
 a condominium or something, one floor plan. 

Recording: (3503/ 9621) 
 So she mainly stays at home. 

Recording: (3504/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3505/ 9621) 
 I think so. 

Recording: (3506/ 9621) 
 It would spread, okay. 

Recording: (3507/ 9621) 
 I haven't tried that, no. I eat tofu a little bit, but not really that much, and I probably should. I've tended more to soy products, and there's so much nutritional value, especially for women. 

Recording: (3508/ 9621) 
 and brought her over to my house on the weekend and everything and showed her the movie. And I said, this is E.T., we're gonna watch E.T. She goes, all right, you know, he was eating pizza, you know, and put it on, and when he dies, she starts bawling and everything. I'm going, well, what's the matter? And she goes, well, he's gonna die. I said, no, you seen the movie. But you know, to her, the way I took it was, you know, it wasn't the same, it wasn't the same movie. 

Recording: (3509/ 9621) 
 We now run under Gregorian and that sort of thing. But back to your question, I think you were asking, 

Recording: (3510/ 9621) 
 Well, in the lower grades, I believe that they are because I think they should have some male role models. 

Recording: (3511/ 9621) 
 That goes with the disorder. They know who's button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and where the line is and they push you always. That's why teachers, they drive the teacher up the wall. 

Recording: (3512/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3513/ 9621) 
 you know, hook it up real tight with guys, but he really likes these guys. 

Recording: (3514/ 9621) 
 But you need to get it out of your chest. 

Recording: (3515/ 9621) 
 It is. 

Recording: (3516/ 9621) 
 A computer called you. 

Recording: (3517/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was easy. 

Recording: (3518/ 9621) 
 You know not that I'm talking negative about my mother that she has some neurological damage 

Recording: (3519/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3520/ 9621) 
 Or they don't really give a damn. That's the thing is I've got I've got some friends that with kids and And I see it like on the bus or with you know when you're working somewhere or not where you people treat their kids, you know 

Recording: (3521/ 9621) 
 And I have kids that say, I do better when I listen to my music. Honest, I do, Mrs. M, please let me listen to my headphones. But then they can't hear you when you say, OK, the time's up, stop now, or whatever. You're going, hey, poke him. So I don't usually let the kids listen to their headphones. Maybe the last week of school in June or something, or maybe right around Christmas time, but most of the time I don't because I get too out of touch with everything that's going on in the room. I don't have a regular size class. I'll have five, six, seven kids at a time. Believe me, when you've got seven hyperactive 

Recording: (3522/ 9621) 
 after I had asked about coming to this city with all this? thousand people and they're all different. Every year they're all different people and that didn't happen back home. I keep meeting people and it's just really fascinating. Yeah, it's this endless flow of people and you're like wow and man there are some good looking people down here. Man, there's some good looking chicks down here in Columbus, let me tell you. Yeah, my freshman year I went out with any of them? The opposite of charismatic is the serious old-time Protestant church where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up your hymnal to those numbers, you sing, you stand up when everyone tells you to stand up, you sit down when everyone tells you to sit down, yada yada. And then the Protestant, sorry, the charismatic is the exact opposite of that. When you think of charismatic, you think of the black churches where there's all sorts of organ playing and praise the Lord and hands in the air and singing and dancing and people falling over and she really introduced me to that. And then we dated for about three months and I, both of us decided, okay, this is, we accomplished what we were supposed to accomplish in this relationship. You've introduced me to something and I've introduced you to something and now we're gonna go our separate ways. And so we separated. And then I found my current church and got plugged in there and I met someone there in January of this year. We dated for two months and then I got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said, oh William you're the person I'm gonna marry and that 

Recording: (3523/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3524/ 9621) 
 in his own mind. Regardless, it's part of that bad spirit that people have created. Not the devil, not Satan. To the native people, he doesn't exist. And to me, he doesn't exist. He's a piece of shit. But he's real. 

Recording: (3525/ 9621) 
 And she wouldn't have learned that a whole day kindergarten here. 

Recording: (3526/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3527/ 9621) 
 These editors are so paranoid, you know what I mean? They're more worried about stopping. 

Recording: (3528/ 9621) 
 We wanted it to keep on going. But they just didn't need to do like that. And then I think once they noticed that the commons were going to open without them, they realized that the university is functioning, or was functioning fine without them. 

Recording: (3529/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3530/ 9621) 
 More like that, right? 

Recording: (3531/ 9621) 
 Reality strikes. 

Recording: (3532/ 9621) 
 what's called ****** high school. 

Recording: (3533/ 9621) 
 It makes me wonder because I don't see a lot of movies, so a lot of this is just from reading reviews and stuff. But it seems like last year, two explosions would do the job. This year, you've got to have five explosions and two car chases and mutilated bodies. It just seems like you need more and more sensationalism to sell your product, and it's scary. It's really hard to do, to talk about morals without bringing religious background or something into it, I think. I think the way the schools should approach it is that if you get pregnant, it's going to ruin your life, so you don't want to do that, do you? That sort of thing. 

Recording: (3534/ 9621) 
 So, I mean, it's something I'm comfortable with. 

Recording: (3535/ 9621) 
 Now. 

Recording: (3536/ 9621) 
 Now what kind of impression is her kids getting? 

Recording: (3537/ 9621) 
 the technical assistance and policy end of it and hated it. The other years were fine, but those last three were pretty bad. 

Recording: (3538/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (3539/ 9621) 
你 

Recording: (3540/ 9621) 
 Well, did you spend much time just passing through the airport in San Francisco? 

Recording: (3541/ 9621) 
 I don't really remember October if that... 

Recording: (3542/ 9621) 
 Well, 

Recording: (3543/ 9621) 
 Franklin Park South is wonderful too, or Franklin Park out east is beautiful too off of East Broad Street. Now that's volunteer also, their guards are volunteer and they're on a grand scale. That's where the conservatory is, right. 

Recording: (3544/ 9621) 
 But why would you make stricter gun laws when you can't even force your traffic laws? 

Recording: (3545/ 9621) 
 So, I mean, carrying cabinets and he'll do it. As long as you're paying him, he'll do it. 

Recording: (3546/ 9621) 
 to wear a condom. I would mostly try to scare him like, these girls could give you things and make your thing fall off. I would try to scare him to make him know to wear a condom because he don't know what he's putting himself into. 

Recording: (3547/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yep. 

Recording: (3548/ 9621) 
 Well, we were in North Africa first for the North African campaign when Romel was still roaming and then that ended up in the summer of Apollo 1942, I believe. And then we were sent to Italy. I was in a field artillery outfit, six-inch guns. 

Recording: (3549/ 9621) 
 Every stage of parenth wonder what causes that. It seems pretty random. Your parents knew of your parents? And I walk to my friend's house and half her friends, if she's going over to play, they got to drive them almost because they're all around. So it's not the neighborhood thing as much. And you can't let them run around as much as we did. We rode our bikes everywhere. We rode to the pool. We rode down to the store. And now you're scared to let them ride around anywhere because you're afraid they're not going to come back. So yeah, it's so many different things. So what was it like being in the military? Oh, it wasn't bad. I enjoyed it a lot. Oh yeah, I watched the first open heart transplant. I saw the first liver transplant. 

Recording: (3550/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3551/ 9621) 
 I'm kind of happy I'm not doing that anymore. It really takes a certain type of person to work for and that's hard to find in that area. 

Recording: (3552/ 9621) 
 Just my wife and I this time. 

Recording: (3553/ 9621) 
 just how like to There's no real like Everybody conforms to their own set of norms in each group, you know It's like people no matter like, you know, even if Ted Kaczynski is out like on you know, wherever and like his little shed, you know He's still a part of society like how you can't get away from society and just how like how society develops in general like how high school is like is is kind of true to to life but then really different too on how life is. It's just more of a close-knit thing so it's more apparent how segregation works or whatever. 

Recording: (3554/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (3555/ 9621) 
 Cool. 

Recording: (3556/ 9621) 
 What are they expecting? She's worked, you know, really hard. And my son, he's a senior. He's 22. He's a senior here. I don't think he's going to graduate in 2000 because he's a new senior. He wants to go to law school. He does a real law school. He's like an honor, honor, honor everything, you know. But that's all, you know, on him. He did it, you know. 

Recording: (3557/ 9621) 
 So that to me is very, like, that's ridiculous. Like the governor, he could have made a stay or, you know what I mean? And they've openly admitted that they've killed people that were found to be innocent later. 

Recording: (3558/ 9621) 
 So I don't know. 

Recording: (3559/ 9621) 
 And the state of Ohio's definition of gifted child is anyone who scores 70% or higher on some test that they give. Well, they've seen half the students in Columbus schools are gifted students. It's impossible. Gifted students, there's 14 different characteristics to look at. You can't just look at one thing. 

Recording: (3560/ 9621) 
 Well, in some ways, I guess it's necessary, but it's just reminiscent about the way it used to look. And I was just at a place last night, I was at this public comment meeting for the Little Darby National Wildlife Refuge that they're planning for Madison County. And there were some talk about that. And it seemed to me there were people that were in favor of the refuge, and there were people that were opposed to the wildlife refuge, mostly people that lived there near their farmers. But it seemed like the one thing that almost everybody there agreed on was they didn't want to see the place go to be overrun by condos and housing developments. And that we, somebody was talking there about the difference between development here in the United States and in Europe and how development in Europe tends to take note of the fact that space is not limitless. So you'll have more people living in one house or one apartment building and they will go up rather than across just to take up space. And you know, they're conscientious about preserving space and preserving wild space. 

Recording: (3561/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (3562/ 9621) 
 was our job. 

Recording: (3563/ 9621) 
 I know, ever, forever. Another thing is people are, the friends of mine are always saying, could you take care of my business for me? Like, could I do their checkbook? Of course I'm not going to do their checkbook. But just like to show them how to keep things in order. 

Recording: (3564/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3565/ 9621) 
 I was born in Boston, lived there, but I moved away before I really even remember it. Moved to Detroit. When I was there, I spent about 10 years there, then moved to Ohio with my family, of course. And then right now, I'm at Ashland University, but I'm thinking about coming to OSU. That's why I came down for the summer, because I have friends down here. So I'm taking a look at it. So basically, that's basically geographically where I've been. 

Recording: (3566/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3567/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3568/ 9621) 
 Is it okay? I'm sorry. 

Recording: (3569/ 9621) 
 this 

Recording: (3570/ 9621) 
 I think sometimes there's a tradeoff between time and money and you just have to look at it and say which is really more important. 

Recording: (3571/ 9621) 
 Don't worry. 

Recording: (3572/ 9621) 
 It should be. But is it? 

Recording: (3573/ 9621) 
 The conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this. 

Recording: (3574/ 9621) 
 Yeah, mine don't have the time. 

Recording: (3575/ 9621) 
 balance Eric 

Recording: (3576/ 9621) 
 in that general area. 

Recording: (3577/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3578/ 9621) 
 Your kid would be thrown in jail, you'd be getting sued for not having insurance. 

Recording: (3579/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3580/ 9621) 
 It's just not wasted. 

Recording: (3581/ 9621) 
 And they're colonials. 

Recording: (3582/ 9621) 
 Keep them out of the public's hands until the right time. But I think though, all in all the solution would be get rid of the criminals. Well, how are you going to do that? You don't know somebody is a criminal until they do something for the first time. 

Recording: (3583/ 9621) 
 and he didn't spell them and he couldn't read them later, nobody has to know that so and so went down the hall and made a copy of so and so's notes on the Xerox machine for the dumb kid. You know, you just say to one student that sits in the front, that's usually a girl, who usually writes really neat and gets it all 

Recording: (3584/ 9621) 
 Good! 

Recording: (3585/ 9621) 
 Well, I've been in a lot more different cultures, seen a lot more different people live, found out how lucky I was. 

Recording: (3586/ 9621) 
 Cuz that's happened where he's like, I won't do it again, and he did it again. I feel like once a cheater, always a cheater. To me, maybe to the next woman he won't do that to, but he's gotten away with it so many times with me, I feel like he wouldn't really do it. 

Recording: (3587/ 9621) 
 I live on the southwest side and work in Dublin. I don't get to campus very much. I get to campus, but it's usually up to the WSU Studios. 

Recording: (3588/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3589/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (3590/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he was he was giving me phone numbers for at least two or three hours. We had several phone books and Like a church calling list and some other obnoxious stuff We had just bunches of numbers and so he just fed me names and numbers and I went through them. It's not 10 after Okay, and So, let's see at the end of that There was a lot of supporting Aaron, and then there was some calling of family people younger. So there was supporting of Aaron, and then there was calling of girlfriend. But you can't do the calling of girlfriend until you've arranged for a ride, because girlfriend lives two and a half hours away. And so if you call the girlfriend and tell the girlfriend that your father just killed himself, she freaks out because she has no way to get there So you have to arrange for a ride first? I ended up having a guy who lives in Logan drive up to Bowling Green to get her and then drive back down to Bring her back and he said is there anything I can do I'm gonna come up there I said sure drive by continue on to okay fine. No Then I could call Evan and say, he will be there in three hours. There'll be a nice silver RX-7 at this location, get in. And so she spent the next two and a half hours canceling classes and stuff. 

Recording: (3591/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3592/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (3593/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (3594/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and every. 

Recording: (3595/ 9621) 
 Over here you have students that come in and work as work studies and this and that and they're in the education field or this, they're gung-ho, they're ready to go. A quarter changes and a whole group new comes in. And most of the teachers there are mothers themselves and they have computers in the room, they're learning. We're sending both of them to kindergarten at OSU too. They offer a kindergarten program there mainly because it's all day. We're in the Hilliard school system and theirs is a half a day so we feel we're better off leaving them there. 

Recording: (3596/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3597/ 9621) 
 Two for country, one for state or province. 

Recording: (3598/ 9621) 
 Right, well kind of like just because everybody else is doing it this way doesn't mean it's the right way. And yeah, you know I really struggle with that because I come more from I think the family should teach it. But let's be realistic, how many families are gonna do that? Or have the mentality to do that? It seems like, I sound like my dad, but it seems like these days most of the people, a lot of people that are having kids shouldn't be. 

Recording: (3599/ 9621) 
 for two bucks, you know, you can't beat that. 

Recording: (3600/ 9621) 
 even doing none of that anymore. So it's very frustrating for us. And the baby they're giving up for adoption. So that's a whole different problem. 

Recording: (3601/ 9621) 
 Oh man. 

Recording: (3602/ 9621) 
 And I said, no, no you're not. 

Recording: (3603/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3604/ 9621) 
 It's just very comical. I was just like, oh. 

Recording: (3605/ 9621) 
 waiting and they all want to go right now. You know and that's how most airplanes are. You know they don't think about anybody else. They think I'm here why aren't I first. You know so. 

Recording: (3606/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (3607/ 9621) 
 What does your wife do? 

Recording: (3608/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3609/ 9621) 
 now 

Recording: (3610/ 9621) 
 There was a little bit, well quite a bit of it was, yeah. Some of the people in the group didn't play sports, but it wasn't all from one sport or another. It was football, wrestlers. It was usually like the best football players, the best wrestlers. 

Recording: (3611/ 9621) 
 to the other side. 

Recording: (3612/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3613/ 9621) 
 But. 

Recording: (3614/ 9621) 
 And they proceeded to set, I think they set two of our guns, the battery, I mean the tires on fire. 

Recording: (3615/ 9621) 
 Yeah, okay. 

Recording: (3616/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that was very exciting. 

Recording: (3617/ 9621) 
 Okay. Yeah, he does. 

Recording: (3618/ 9621) 
 I turned him into a zombie. 

Recording: (3619/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3620/ 9621) 
 Daryl. 

Recording: (3621/ 9621) 
 I do tomatoes anyhow. I'll pay the extra higher price for the better ones. 

Recording: (3622/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you just set the computer and key the data in. Or, well, the system we're doing now is you can put in the address, the URL for a web resource, and it goes out and extracts data, analyzes what's there, and comes up with subject terminology and call numbers and presents it back to you, and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it. So it's doing some of that. Some of that, the automatic assigning of subject headings and call numbers. We're doing a lot of research on that. It's got a ways to go. It's getting better. 

Recording: (3623/ 9621) 
 I don't think that really matters honestly. I mean it's, I mean by the time you get into the Boy Scouts you're usually 8th grade or something like that, 7th, 8th grade and up. And I think by that time most kids have at least a general idea of who they are and what they like and don't like. I can't see, I can't see them actually looking at like their leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore. Obviously it should be someone they respect, but I can't say that they'd be like, oh well he does it so I'm going to have to do it too or whatever. 

Recording: (3624/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (3625/ 9621) 
 I had always maintained that back in the day Darth Vader was a tragic hero of the Star Wars thing. It wasn't about the innocence of Luke Skywalker and rebellion. 

Recording: (3626/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3627/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3628/ 9621) 
 So how do you know? How do you know? 

Recording: (3629/ 9621) 
 Sure! 

Recording: (3630/ 9621) 
 long car trips. One of the families is in Oregon near the coast. I forget the name of the town. Not far. I think it's along the coast in Oregon near Eugene or something like that. And the other is in Louisiana, I think Alexandria. Which is where my mom's family came from. They came from Louisiana. Yeah, my background is interesting. My mother was born in Louisiana and my father was born in New Rochelle, New York as the son of immigrant Jewish parents from Lithuania. 

Recording: (3631/ 9621) 
 death of protection 

Recording: (3632/ 9621) 
 Doesn't that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me, me, me now and therefore they really don't so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are? 

Recording: (3633/ 9621) 
 or you know, the things that we learned when we were kids because our mom taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something. They all look at you like, Christopher Robin, who's that? Piglet, who's that? You know, there's a whole generation of kids now whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale stuff and nursery rhyme stuff, they don't have a clue what you're talking about. 

Recording: (3634/ 9621) 
 Well, I think they got that all off of the TV. I mean, that influenced. 

Recording: (3635/ 9621) 
 Right, at the age that they were. 

Recording: (3636/ 9621) 
 She said, well, you have to take a foreign language. I said, look, I'm not taking any more foreign languages. We're going to figure out how to avoid this. No, you have to take a foreign. I said, look, lady, there are 60,000 students in this university. And if you think that I'm going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the College of Foreign Language, you're insane. There's another way to do this experience. What is it? Well, you have to take a foreign language. I said, OK, we're going to change the question a little bit here. You have two options now. Tell me how to avoid taking a foreign language or tell me how to talk to somebody who isn't you because that's apparently all I've gotten available. She said, well, you have to take, I said, how do I talk to somebody else? She said, well, you have to talk to me as long as you're in this college. I was like, where's the form? 

Recording: (3637/ 9621) 
 You're from where? 

Recording: (3638/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure that the federal government has the ability to convince enough people to do it. And I don't think it's, I think the people that are going to be ready to accept it and go with it are, I don't think you're going to get a good cross section of the population. I think the people will be willing to understand it and go with it more. They're going to be the more educated and that sort of thing. Then you're leaving out a larger part of the population. So I'm not sure it's going to give valid results anyway. 

Recording: (3639/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, exactly. The last three outs, everyone's like, yeah, let's hope he does it. But until then, you're like, OK, this is ridiculous. 

Recording: (3640/ 9621) 
 and there were several couples who got married. 

Recording: (3641/ 9621) 
 उहुँ. 

Recording: (3642/ 9621) 
 but 

Recording: (3643/ 9621) 
 They could have taken other, well they killed all these people off, but they could have put them into the background, had them do a couple of shows a season, and then had, I don't know, the adventures of Agent Spender and what's her name, but then they killed off all those supporting former X-Files associated people 

Recording: (3644/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3645/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3646/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3647/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's a good growing area. The job prospects are a little scarce, you know, because the smaller town, but yeah, there's only about a 1% unemployment rate there. 

Recording: (3648/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (3649/ 9621) 
 um... but recently they are getting into going to church 

Recording: (3650/ 9621) 
 And most of your people that own guns that are killing people are usually your poorer people. 

Recording: (3651/ 9621) 
 I bet you have. You just didn't know it. 

Recording: (3652/ 9621) 
 What did you play? Jam oriented stuff, you know, like the dead like that like I don't know like Like like dead more like kind of like reggae type stuff to just like a bunch of different things. I 

Recording: (3653/ 9621) 
 They are, they're wonderful. Everybody always says to me, Rachel, I just don't know what you're doing. Will you come and take care of mine for me? And it's the fact that I have a tremendous respect for my kids. I mean, I really value their opinions, and I treat them, everybody says, your mom's weird. She talks to us strange. It's because I talk to them like I talk to you, at whatever age they are. You know, I don't, yeah, I don't talk down to kids. 

Recording: (3654/ 9621) 
 Um, I don't know if you could say that. There were a lot of problems. I mean, I even had problems, like on the school bus and stuff, you know. But I had black friends, so I didn't have much, you know, much problems. 

Recording: (3655/ 9621) 
 Okay, so you're higher up there than I would be. 

Recording: (3656/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3657/ 9621) 
 40 is like the limit. 

Recording: (3658/ 9621) 
 Yeah, not really. I mean, I go to this club, Access, sometimes. I mean, that's short north, whatever. It's okay. I don't know, I mean, the Red Zone's downtown. I really don't go there. I don't like that place. I don't know. Kind of the winter months really kill doing anything, really any foot like foot traffic type things I mean in the summer it seems it seems in the winter it seems there's more 

Recording: (3659/ 9621) 
 I mean I think they could try. If their kids try to push them away, they shouldn't let their kids push them away. I guess you can't make your kid go out with you and do things. 

Recording: (3660/ 9621) 
 though. 

Recording: (3661/ 9621) 
 So really that's about it. I have a dog who's outside right now and that's it for my kids. 

Recording: (3662/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (3663/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I want to take up a couple music courses and get a little further on that. Better my education and what it already is. I don't consider myself the dumbest person, but I know I'm not the smartest. 

Recording: (3664/ 9621) 
 A lot of online magazines, music magazines. 

Recording: (3665/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like have someone come and tell them you have this much time or I wouldn't recommend you stay on this program this long and I know there's programs that if you get on it and they pay you, you have to pay that money back after you get on your feet. Well, I mean, I think someone should be able to come out and tell you about these things and let you know what you can and have to do to do this. 

Recording: (3666/ 9621) 
 so. 

Recording: (3667/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (3668/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, like... 

Recording: (3669/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3670/ 9621) 
 See, I don't want that to happen to me. Because I just, that's, I mean I had a guy that I did start dating when my son was a baby. But it just, he fell in love with me. 

Recording: (3671/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (3672/ 9621) 
 along the Lassie line and leave it to beaver. 

Recording: (3673/ 9621) 
 Yeah, basically for the entire summer. And then if I like it, I'll be enrolling. 

Recording: (3674/ 9621) 
 I see that. 

Recording: (3675/ 9621) 
 What do you do sit on the couch and watch TV and eat bonbons all day? You know, it's kind of 

Recording: (3676/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3677/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3678/ 9621) 
 Right. Where they go to the clinic sometimes and the clinic's basically a pill pop-up place. You know, here, take these, you'll feel better, you know. And they really don't get any satisfaction for what they're on, you know, outside of, you know, you tell them you can't drink, but yet you give them a pill that'll give them the same effect, you know. 

Recording: (3679/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (3680/ 9621) 
 I met her in high school. She's still in high school and I'm in college. 

Recording: (3681/ 9621) 
 Was it, was, they actually had a law or they, or it was a referendum? 

Recording: (3682/ 9621) 
 Well, one of the things I'm doing is I'm applying for a number of research grants to go to Germany and continue my research. So hopefully I'll get one of those. I think I'm in pretty good shape to get one of those. So that might cause me to put off grad school for a year, but I don't think the grad schools will mind if I 

Recording: (3683/ 9621) 
 from our friends that have gone, yeah, their discipline is expelling the child from school. Well, they're expelling them to a home where the parent's working, where they're just getting three days of free play. I mean, pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble. They really aren't learning from that. 

Recording: (3684/ 9621) 
 staggered backbeats and stuff. So I can play bass and I have a processor thing and stuff that I fool around with, just doing stuff like that. Some of my friends play on drum machines and stuff like that, so I just do stuff like that more like, it's not like you're playing, you're not spinning records, it's like making 

Recording: (3685/ 9621) 
 It's like each neighborhood's got a little different personality. 

Recording: (3686/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I've been a fan forever pretty much. I didn't really have any other teams. 

Recording: (3687/ 9621) 
 Subjective, right? 

Recording: (3688/ 9621) 
 Yeah, just ridiculous amounts of stuff. I'm like, I don't want to do that. 

Recording: (3689/ 9621) 
 serious illness that needs to be helped, not just, you know, well, stick them in a place where they can just concentrate on it even more. So we've got a long ways to go there. 

Recording: (3690/ 9621) 
 mhm 

Recording: (3691/ 9621) 
 I did have a job like that when I worked full time. 

Recording: (3692/ 9621) 
 Am I dressing crazy? 

Recording: (3693/ 9621) 
 because it's hard for us to deal with. 

Recording: (3694/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I can say there are some drugs that I don't really consider to be too threatening or that I'm really too worried about people using. Like I mean just the whole idea with marijuana, things like that. I mean it doesn't really bother me so much. I mean cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does. 

Recording: (3695/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha 

Recording: (3696/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (3697/ 9621) 
 take that away. 

Recording: (3698/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (3699/ 9621) 
 I mean, my middle brother was always around. He wasn't very social in high school. 

Recording: (3700/ 9621) 
 I told him that he gets no guarantee that I will come back and in exchange I don't get health coverage while I'm gone. That seems perfectly reasonable to me and I go, okay, super. 

Recording: (3701/ 9621) 
 And so I think I'll probably end up changing. I don't know what to. It would probably be more towards the education line. 

Recording: (3702/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3703/ 9621) 
 Whether it's a written goal or not, that's what they're doing. 

Recording: (3704/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3705/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (3706/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3707/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3708/ 9621) 
 or board games or just anything that happens to appeal. 

Recording: (3709/ 9621) 
 Because I thought, you know, basically the city's been ran pretty well. Basically. You know, as far as cities are. 

Recording: (3710/ 9621) 
 Yeah, where are they needed? Right. 

Recording: (3711/ 9621) 
 you. 

Recording: (3712/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (3713/ 9621) 
 And so eventually he did. He just got used to her. 

Recording: (3714/ 9621) 
 that. 

Recording: (3715/ 9621) 
 I don't know, I guess that's one way to get you into the business, but I don't know. How do you prepare yourself for teaching in front of a large audience? That's something I would have to, anyways, ease myself into. 

Recording: (3716/ 9621) 
 I don't know just exactly where the others are, but they're here in the Columbus area. 

Recording: (3717/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well you're very smart, you know. 

Recording: (3718/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3719/ 9621) 
 And he just looks at me like, you are so weird. And hey, I'll talk to the TV during Jerry Springer or something. You're so wrong. People look at me like, OK. I sit at home all day. 

Recording: (3720/ 9621) 
 That's adults. 

Recording: (3721/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (3722/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3723/ 9621) 
 Now with Easton I think it's really helped with Columbus and I think it's just going to get better and better. 

Recording: (3724/ 9621) 
 or sustaining heat when heated by a fire. 

Recording: (3725/ 9621) 
 or Ohio, yeah I think. I'm not really sure. I know they're from Ireland. 

Recording: (3726/ 9621) 
 Probably not. 

Recording: (3727/ 9621) 
 I knew we wouldn't go into this city where all these terrible things are. Dance clubs, drugs, homosexuality. And you're going to go the other direction. You're going to lose your faith. But it Christians. And before I left for college my freshman year, my dad, my dad knows me real well, mainly because I'm doing almost a mirror image of what he did when he grew up, aside from the faith that I have. I'm very much like him. He wrote out a list of seven things, seven predictions for William's freshman year. And every single one of them was accurate. It was really, really, really funny. William will lose something expensive by the end of the year and I had my bike stolen. Great. direction. And I knew one way or the other what happened because I'm the type, I mean, my roommate my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer. Oh yeah, it was real fun, real fun. I discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm. He still doesn't know it was me, but yeah, he still doesn't know it was me, but he and I are still on speaking terms, which is fascinating. But, you know, I mean, our first day I walked in, he said, hey, I'm Tom, you ever smoke pot before? I was like, no. He said, hey, we got a whole year together. And I'm directly quoting, that is the first thing he said to me. That is the first thing he said to me. No, no, he's not. But he and I hung out a lot and I knew that one of the things was gonna happen. I was gonna follow him and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind. Every time I would have done them, I would have known they were wrong. Or I was going to the opposite direction and I went the opposite direction. I got plugged in with some Christian groups on campus, made some Christian friends and hung out with them and grew a lot. Grew a lot in acceptance of other people. I mean, you don't really run into homosexuals in a small rural Christian community. And if you do, you don't know it because they'll get shunned out of the community so fast that it's crazy. But, where was I going with that? Okay. 

Recording: (3728/ 9621) 
 Wow, that's great. 

Recording: (3729/ 9621) 
 I'm originally from Columbus and I'm an event coordinator for which is a excellent caterer in German Village. I'm 43 years old. I've just been married three years. I have no children. I've lived in Columbus most of my life although I have I went to school in Atlanta and I also lived in Orlando, Florida. I used to have an interior plantscape business and that's what I moved to Florida for. So I'm really interested in horticulture, interior design, botany. But when I did move back from Columbus, I was amazed about just in a five year span how much it had grown and I think it's a really good city to live in. I think it's really progressed well and I enjoy living here. 

Recording: (3730/ 9621) 
 That would be neat, that would be real neat. But that's Dreamworld, so.

 They have this entrance and there are these trees on the inside of the house that are just growing down into everything and they're like crystals and they have this one room that looks like a sphinx and then they have this backyard that looks all cute, old England. It's a really, really cool house.

 It's called Venturing Crew. It's kind of this offshoot of Boy Scouts, and it's for ages 14 to 21 co-ed. 

Recording: (3734/ 9621) 
 No, my roommates are. My mom wanted me to, but the way it stems right now, I just would rather work or money. 

Recording: (3735/ 9621) 
 His last name. 

Recording: (3736/ 9621) 
 I lived, I studied in Bristol and then when I went back and worked and then lived again I lived in London. 

Recording: (3737/ 9621) 
 And he needed, but if like. 

Recording: (3738/ 9621) 
 What's that? 

Recording: (3739/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (3740/ 9621) 
 I went to public kindergarten through sixth, and actually I was quite pleased with the program, but my mom also had me in CCD classes. It's Monday nights you go and you get the basis of the church, and that was important to me. And then I went to parochial school for seventh and eighth grade, which was, in my opinion, horrendous. But, excuse me, I think it's the age of the children in general, you know, the whole puberty thing. And going into a new school where these kids have been together since kindergarten and trying to fit in at that age. And then I went to parochial school, I went to parochial school for high school. And that was a very good experience. 

Recording: (3741/ 9621) 
 Right, yeah. I've run into just a few problems at Antrim. Um, since I do like to jog, even though I'm very slow, most of the people that take their dogs there take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and whatnot. Which is okay, you're not supposed to do that, but when I'm jogging with my dog on a leash and all the other dogs come up, it irritates me. 

Recording: (3742/ 9621) 
 No, I got to babysit for like a week and then she has a best friend that's watching her baby and a friend of hers that has other kids too so it's real good for the baby. 

Recording: (3743/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (3744/ 9621) 
 Yeah, cards with the characters and they all have different powers. The daughter has this thing called a Pokédex. I'm like, what's a Pokédex? She's like, I want the Pokédex. So we get this thing. It's a little computer. You open it up. You print in the name of the person you want. It puts up his picture. It tells you all the information about him, what kind of character he is, what his powers are. It's just like, it's mind boggling. Yeah, it is. That's what is. Of all the Pokemon. I don't know where it leads. Is it any worse than baseball cards? 

Recording: (3745/ 9621) 
 what I'm saying when I talk to them. Or my mother, very nice human being, and a bunch of people I don't know. 

Recording: (3746/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3747/ 9621) 
 Exactly. That's the idea that people get. I don't think they realize how much work it is. 

Recording: (3748/ 9621) 
 Green Bay Packers. 

Recording: (3749/ 9621) 
 How am I going to tell who's trying to butter me up by raising their hand and asking questions? 

Recording: (3750/ 9621) 
 perfect example, you know, or your computer can't tell you that you spelled O-N-E when you meant to spell W-O-N. 

Recording: (3751/ 9621) 
 Right, that's true. 

Recording: (3752/ 9621) 
 It's just like there's a lot of different influences and everything. And there's just a lot of places you can go with it. So that's real good. 

Recording: (3753/ 9621) 
 that and I heard, I kind of like the change they're talking about. They're talking about putting underground power lines and taking the poles out. 

Recording: (3754/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3755/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so that's what I want to do, is just, yeah. 

Recording: (3756/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah, I mean, maybe break-ins are down. We're holding up 7-Elevens are down, but then you hear these, you know, murders. 

Recording: (3757/ 9621) 
 Awwwwwww. 

Recording: (3758/ 9621) 
 That would just be too scary for me. 

Recording: (3759/ 9621) 
 as back in the high school. 

Recording: (3760/ 9621) 
 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 

Recording: (3761/ 9621) 
 Well, Westerville, yeah. So that's difficult for us to deal with. 

Recording: (3762/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3763/ 9621) 
 That's where we are in our evolution on this one. 

Recording: (3764/ 9621) 
 Well, definitely, it just happened to me when I was in the third grade. Two of our friends went home after school and we were playing with a gun and everything and one of them shot and killed the other one, you know, accidentally. It just goes to, you know, my dad always had the gun. He didn't have it locked up all the time, but it wasn't necessarily in the same place all the time either. So if you weren't really looking for it, you'd have to just happenstance onto it or something. I believe nowadays that perhaps with the guns, the availability, and more people having guns that shouldn't have them, apparently. You know, they should be under lock and key. And as for the parents, somebody's responsible for it, you know. But see, then you get into catch-22 because of the legislation. I mean, you can't require, I don't see how you can require a guy who buys a gun to buy a lock and then buy a safe for the gun and do all that stuff because that, in the case of a burglar comes into your house, which is why you have a gun anyway, you have some fear of something like that happening. Otherwise, you shouldn't have one unless you're a sportsman. Then, you know, it's not gonna be worth it to have the gun in the first place. 

Recording: (3765/ 9621) 
 So I pretty much, it's not stressful at all. It's really easy. It's not challenging. 

Recording: (3766/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he's... Yeah, he's 26. 

Recording: (3767/ 9621) 
 Probably it is, you're right. I asked him what language did he have to learn to get it. 

Recording: (3768/ 9621) 
 I have a great employer and I got hired in one of the opening lines in the interview conversation is hi, I'm and In this particular month, I'm going to Europe and I may or may not come back. You want to continue talking? He said sure. Let's keep talking. I said, okay, and then we continue talking so It's up in the air 

Recording: (3769/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3770/ 9621) 
 And he was always like really red faced and the kids would say, you know, he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back. And that was one of the better schools in Columbus. And, you know, I just saw a lot of that. I just saw a lot of principals driving big fabulous cars. 

Recording: (3771/ 9621) 
 by the time being since nanny which the pro-chip killed and uh... you 

Recording: (3772/ 9621) 
 And it's really unfortunate for the good workers in there. And the people at Mirror Lake are so great. 

Recording: (3773/ 9621) 
 I teach a class on Thursday nights, how to play with computers. I play games on Tuesday nights. 

Recording: (3774/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (3775/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there was a lot of them and they were not very good. 

Recording: (3776/ 9621) 
 Oh yes, I did vote. 

Recording: (3777/ 9621) 
 And I don't know, I think having the word honors gives some kids enough prestige that they don't totally freak out about not going Ivy League. 

Recording: (3778/ 9621) 
 Boy, I don't know, I'm thinking, you know, of the divorced people I know who've had children involved. And boy, it always seems to me by the time they get to that step, it's already, you know, they've already been to counseling, they've already tried a lot of other things. And that they're, I don't know whether some kind of court-ordered thinking about it, heavy thinking, would 

Recording: (3779/ 9621) 
 That's true. Books, reading. Well, I think it's normal to read books and stuff, but you're sitting there, or you're reading a magazine. Did you know what this guy did? Look down at him. Did you see what this guy did? 

Recording: (3780/ 9621) 
 And it's really sort of interesting. 

Recording: (3781/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but I mean, that's civilization-wide. 

Recording: (3782/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (3783/ 9621) 
 And eventually he was all right with it. He got used to it. 

Recording: (3784/ 9621) 
 A lot of them, they don't want any better, they don't want anything different, that's all they want. 

Recording: (3785/ 9621) 
 But, you know, I knew that they had already made that promise and there's a lot of businesses that could move out of that area, you know, and half of those taxes come to Columbus. Even if a business is in Westerville, half the tax, the employees tax are going to Westerville and half are coming to Columbus. 

Recording: (3786/ 9621) 
 gun locks were easy to pick, you can break into anything. But when I was a kid too, we used to go out to turkey shoots and I'd go hunting all the time. So I was pretty familiar with guns. My kid, he grew up, he was familiar with guns, but he also knew not to touch them. 

Recording: (3787/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't. Well, we just sort of started making a big splash in Australia in about the last three years. So they may have 

Recording: (3788/ 9621) 
 I'm trying to work on my license for skydiving now. 

Recording: (3789/ 9621) 
 that you would need, like in the old days, you know, to melt metal. They used air pumping it through 

Recording: (3790/ 9621) 
 Not yet, I mean he'll pull himself up on table and he'll like turn around like, hey. 

Recording: (3791/ 9621) 
 But yeah, I hope to, at 49, I've learned a heck of a lot. A lot of things I wouldn't want to know, but I think they've been really good as long as you turn them around and make them a positive statement for you. But that's why I'd really like to have a bookstore just down around campus. people can come in and go over there and relax, you know, and, mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3792/ 9621) 
 Well, when I came back from Oregon, my father was very ill. And so I didn't want full-time work. And I started substituting out in Licking County, which paid terribly low. There's all these little districts that have a superintendent. Well, no, they have two elementaries, one middle school and one high school, and a superintendent, which they don't need, you know. So they hire straight out of college always. And there is a law that you have to pay for your accumulated time. So I couldn't get a job out there because I had about six years experience they had to pay me for. So I came back into Columbus. And it's a lot harder to work in Columbus public, but I know the territory. I know where I'm going. 

Recording: (3793/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (3794/ 9621) 
 Well, basically it's the same thing here. But some of your management is real good. I've seen people that are super, but I've seen people that are bad. The problem is you get a bad management and it can make your life hell. I don't care who you are. 

Recording: (3795/ 9621) 
 So he's learning about the computer now. It's going to be kind of a hobby type thing. At least it's not a work thing, but I know we can do a lot of things for our house. 

Recording: (3796/ 9621) 
 and I hate hearing myself on tape too. 

Recording: (3797/ 9621) 
 I, you know, maybe I'm oblivious to things, but I mean, it seems like there's a lot of worse places. 

Recording: (3798/ 9621) 
 I don't know if I could trust them, you know? 

Recording: (3799/ 9621) 
 video. 

Recording: (3800/ 9621) 
 Okay, well, you know the shot is 

Recording: (3801/ 9621) 
 I'll stay. So if you went undergrad, you would? Yeah, I'm in the guinea pig class of this program through the medical school, where after three years of undergrad, I go to med school here, like without MCATs or anything. 

Recording: (3802/ 9621) 
 I could see that thing, he'd be ducking them, you know. 77 years old, I can't imagine being hurt by him, you know. 

Recording: (3803/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you can't say a noun is always going to be orange and it's going to be slippery. You know, I mean, language is so much more abstract than math and science. So the abstract areas like history and English and reading and literature, that's where these kids have their problems because their disability is usually rooted in somewhere in the languages. They either can't write, can't read, can't spell, can't do all three, or aren't very good at any of them. Once in a while you'll see a good speller because he can remember the order in which the letters come. But he might be a horrible reader and a horrible writer even though he can spell. Yeah, and his comprehension of the words of other kids his age wouldn't be what it should be. Generally speaking, my kids are two to four years behind. 

Recording: (3804/ 9621) 
 It's 

Recording: (3805/ 9621) 
 I didn't really start out as a teacher. I started out as a speech and hearing therapist. But they kept giving me these kids that I couldn't keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them. So I got interested in the hyperactivity and so I started taking classes about kids with ADHD and stuff. And little by little, for C&O, I had my master's in learning disabilities. It was mostly just so I could learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy. Then when I found out there were so many openings in special ed, so, and then I found out later that speech therapy is a very good background for LD because a lot of these LD kids have language deficits and language problems. They can't, you know, like express themselves on paper or they don't process things correctly auditorily. So that's the perfect background to work with LD kids. I didn't know I was doing that at the time. 

Recording: (3806/ 9621) 
 sure. Well that and they like Tuesday when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there she came in and I did I was reading a book and I let her out and I let her back in and I started reading again and I'm looking around and here's mud. So it's kind of good in a way because it kind of well you know you live here it's not that big of a deal you know because I know my sister would freak. 

Recording: (3807/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3808/ 9621) 
 Well, it was just communication wasn't there. 

Recording: (3809/ 9621) 
 Well, I think it's more capable of being violent because of the information available to people about bombs and stuff like that, you know, or before, you know, somebody get mad at somebody, you know, you might, they might shoot them or something, but not kill 100 innocent people for no reason. 

Recording: (3810/ 9621) 
 To Abbe House. 

Recording: (3811/ 9621) 
 You know, like, you know, typical American tourist. 

Recording: (3812/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I love that show. I have nearly every episode on tape, but this past season I've been really disappointed with The Simpsons. 

Recording: (3813/ 9621) 
 which isn't fun. And number two, you know, the diseases and things like that. I think that's a good idea to teach just that it's not all fun and peer pressured stuff. I know I kind of got off track there, but. 

Recording: (3814/ 9621) 
 Hehe. 

Recording: (3815/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't think he spends time with him like that. He sees him at his mom's house and he will come by and see him at my house. But I try to put a, I don't know, because we seem to argue a lot. And I don't like for my kid to see that. So I try to do the best thing for my son. 

Recording: (3816/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's probably about four years left. I'm almost done with all my GECs and everything like that, so that's about done. 

Recording: (3817/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my roommate actually had that teacher and none of the allegations are true. 

Recording: (3818/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (3819/ 9621) 
 No, she lost her eye when she was six playing cowboys and Indians with her brother. 

Recording: (3820/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (3821/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3822/ 9621) 
 Just 

Recording: (3823/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3824/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (3825/ 9621) 
 not believe it, they know it. 

Recording: (3826/ 9621) 
 He wanted to, but. 

Recording: (3827/ 9621) 
 His mom even signed for stuff, I think. 

Recording: (3828/ 9621) 
 You know just always just active and he's always been very active in sports. But when I put him on the riddle and he was laying on the couch you know just zombie doubt. 

Recording: (3829/ 9621) 
 to make money on the side all through the government. That's what I mean. It's too easy to get away with stuff nowadays. 

Recording: (3830/ 9621) 
 I think they should too. I do. I really do. And you're right, that's not fair because then that's a waste. 

Recording: (3831/ 9621) 
 I don't know. Do you know anything about Unix? 

Recording: (3832/ 9621) 
 You could call the operations over there and say, is this airplane on the ground? 

Recording: (3833/ 9621) 
 and they set the ammunition on fire, they just shot our gun position up pretty good. And that night, finally, they, well I don't know exactly how we got a hold of back to our headquarters, but anyway we did. So they sent the prime movers, the trucks which we moved the guns with out. And we hitched what was remaining of the guns on them and went back wondering now, they gonna put us in infantry or something? We don't have any artillery guns. But I don't know what it was, but a couple or three days, they had more guns, I mean more artillery pieces up there for us to use. And then one other time after in Italy, or when we were in Italy, they moved us into a position that we should have never been in. We were, you know, let's say we come around a mountain, like there's a mountain here, 

Recording: (3834/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (3835/ 9621) 
 So it made me squirm a little bit always in my seat. That happened, I was kind of like, I know who he's talking to. My mother's two sisters married Southern Baptist ministers. 

Recording: (3836/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3837/ 9621) 
 And go back and ask him. As I would ask my English teacher in school, anybody that said, well, what did this poet, what was his, he wrote this poem. And I gave him my interpretation. No, no, no, they say, no, no, that wasn't it. They'd share their thought. How do you know that was it? He's been dead. 

Recording: (3838/ 9621) 
 I was in the Cub Scouts. 

Recording: (3839/ 9621) 
 I'm looking for a part-time job as we speak. I've been like doing temporary on and off. The thing with that is you can work, you know, for four or five months and then nothing and then like that. So right now I'm looking for something permanent. 

Recording: (3840/ 9621) 
 So I think 

Recording: (3841/ 9621) 
 Her little boyfriend who was the Captain Kirk, Commander Riker, stud persona, I see in many ways. I mean, I agree in Deep Space Nine, I'm a big Deep Space Nine fan, it's like I don't dislike Voyager, I just don't like it to the same degree. In Deep Space Nine, they had Major Kira, who was a soldier and a revolutionary, and I thought in many ways she completely broke out of traditional gender roles. I also like Deep Space Nine in that they address the issue of different people living and working together, different people of different, I mean these were aliens rather than different ethnic denominations of humans, but it approached that from a less, from a more realistic standpoint, instead of having like an old Star Trek, everyone gets along, then we come to people who don't get along and we look at the problems. It was centered on that. I'm getting off topic. I wanted to go back to Voyager, what you were saying with the generals. I liked at first having Captain Janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint, but I still think that the women on the show, particularly Seven of Nine, are used as sex objects for the viewers. 

Recording: (3842/ 9621) 
 Oh, were they, they were already in the garage, did they not buy them themselves? 

Recording: (3843/ 9621) 
 It's just because it's in the name of government. They're suspicious. 

Recording: (3844/ 9621) 
好 

Recording: (3845/ 9621) 
 they were helping out the new guys. 

Recording: (3846/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3847/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (3848/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3849/ 9621) 
 Sometimes it's even easier to understand them because they enunciate so well. But that's something we've never understood. If we can fake that accent. 

Recording: (3850/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3851/ 9621) 
 a while. 

Recording: (3852/ 9621) 
 I know, I know. But you know, there's three of the family, three of the children have children. And they each have two. And each one, the girl is the oldest and then the boy, the second. And that's good though. And I hope, and I know my son who isn't married right now, he's 31. I know that he wants children very badly. So I should probably end up with about 8 or 10. I would imagine so. 

Recording: (3853/ 9621) 
 I know, yeah, I know, it's ridiculous. I'm just, I find that just crazy. 

Recording: (3854/ 9621) 
 So do kangaroos actually bounce? Or is that just, you know? 

Recording: (3855/ 9621) 
 mhm 

Recording: (3856/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3857/ 9621) 
 that, that, I was like, whoa, milk is in. And so they changed his diet around, watch, I mean, they're only, right now they're eating, they're on an organic diet. Now I don't know if I could afford that, but. 

Recording: (3858/ 9621) 
 For him to not make the honor roll every time, I couldn't even imagine what was happening with him. And now he's completely back on track and doing really well. And my eighth grade daughter is, my kids are involved in all kinds of different things. She's real involved with theater. Everything that comes along, you know, she wins the science fair, she gets the power of the pen, she is on student count. They all have lots of different kinds of things that they're involved in and that I'm incredibly proud of them because they're just, they're, and they're really, they're not geeky and goofy, they're really neat. 

Recording: (3859/ 9621) 
 Yeah, things that are like simple chord changes, and you can just fool around with on them and stuff 

Recording: (3860/ 9621) 
 Not really, I mean, she... I don't know, my mom's kind of weird like that. She more believes in the religion aspects of it, not so much as what the Catholics believe about it. Like their views on outside of religious matters. 

Recording: (3861/ 9621) 
 are 

Recording: (3862/ 9621) 
 little bit 

Recording: (3863/ 9621) 
 fire hazards 

Recording: (3864/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3865/ 9621) 
 It's quite an investment. 

Recording: (3866/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3867/ 9621) 
 Yes, I did. 

Recording: (3868/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3869/ 9621) 
 You know, and nobody does the 60 hour work weeks like some people apparently are accustomed to around here. 

Recording: (3870/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3871/ 9621) 
 It's easy. 

Recording: (3872/ 9621) 
 You know, other towns just don't. 

Recording: (3873/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I did telemarketing for a while, but that's terrible. People, yeah, I got tired of people yelling at me, like, you interrupted my dinner, and blah, blah, blah. But it was okay, because the place I worked at didn't monitor our calls, so you could just yell at them, and you'd just be like, I don't care. 

Recording: (3874/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3875/ 9621) 
 Well, there's plenty of stuff. Yeah, well, it's not like sex. It's a little bit safer. But it's kind of just go out with your equipment. And if you catch one, you catch one. If you don't, then you don't. But I've caught plenty of dinners, lunch, breakfast, all that. 

Recording: (3876/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (3877/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3878/ 9621) 
 It is? 

Recording: (3879/ 9621) 
 Yeah, some of the guys from the Venturing crew live there. 

Recording: (3880/ 9621) 
 I hop you hop. 

Recording: (3881/ 9621) 
 That'll come later maybe when I retire. Wait. 

Recording: (3882/ 9621) 
 before we got, this was our first house. 

Recording: (3883/ 9621) 
 I have to admit, when we go to try to play golf sometimes and not have a tee time, you can't even get in. 

Recording: (3884/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3885/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3886/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (3887/ 9621) 
 No, I think they liked that. It was really funny because here, if you went into a school or something and said, we want to help, we want to teach a class or 

Recording: (3888/ 9621) 
 None at all. He's always had very definite opinions of how his life should be. 

Recording: (3889/ 9621) 
 Take care of that soon. 

Recording: (3890/ 9621) 
 That's nice. 

Recording: (3891/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3892/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3893/ 9621) 
 Early admission pathway. 

Recording: (3894/ 9621) 
 And it still is. And that was the problem with school. He just wouldn't do the work. I mean, you give him a test, and he could pass it and do really well, but he just wouldn't do the work. 

Recording: (3895/ 9621) 
 Can I just say yes? I like lots of stuff. I like games. 

Recording: (3896/ 9621) 
 He really doesn't like it, like how things work. 

Recording: (3897/ 9621) 
 Fatherly instinct. 

Recording: (3898/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3899/ 9621) 
 objectives because when we went into the service and then went overseas, our objective was to do away with Hitler and Mussolini. And I don't know, I'm just thankful that he wasn't carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something because that was rough. 

Recording: (3900/ 9621) 
 Just travel to Australia maybe. You hear these stories, you ever go to Europe? You ever do the backpacking bit? 

Recording: (3901/ 9621) 
 or to do anything extreme to their bodies. 

Recording: (3902/ 9621) 
 Or maybe it's... well... 

Recording: (3903/ 9621) 
 and stuff. Because I used to go from Henderson down to Lane Avenue and I'd hit one light on Olentangy and that was it. 

Recording: (3904/ 9621) 
 Crazy bad. Like the prices in the stores are like way outrageous to me. 

Recording: (3905/ 9621) 
 Let me focus on your question. I'm not sure that she was answering what I thought you were. 

Recording: (3906/ 9621) 
 Oh, I thought about being a medical scientist with a MD-PhD. And I do research with applications to medicine, but more in the biochemistry field, or genetics, or something like that. 

Recording: (3907/ 9621) 
 I see, I mean, you see, the computer can't be wrong, he said. 

Recording: (3908/ 9621) 
 I think I was at that Penn State game. I have a cousin who is a golf pro over near Penn State. 

Recording: (3909/ 9621) 
 And most kids don't do that nowadays. 

Recording: (3910/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3911/ 9621) 
 So they knew that this Bush name would bring out a lot of money, which it has. He's got a lot of money to work with. And you know, that doesn't seem fair either. I don't think, you know, the average person in the United States, the average person, doesn't think that your politicians should be bought, you know. 

Recording: (3912/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha 

Recording: (3913/ 9621) 
 Not like I am. 

Recording: (3914/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well she went with us last time and she liked some stuff, but... 

Recording: (3915/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3916/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think it does. I like to exercise. I think it's fun. I would just do it four hours a day if I could do that. Although I haven't for the last six weeks, I haven't done anything because it's just I've had these other things that are that are really pressing. You know how that is. You get you have some things you just have to get done. And then when I get this stuff cleared out, there'll be a break and then I'll be able to go back to it. 

Recording: (3917/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3918/ 9621) 
 Yes, I grew up on the west side. My husband went, proximity wise, it's probably within a mile of each other. We were kind of high school sweethearts and the whole bit. His dad still lives in Grove City. My mom lives still at our old family house there on the west side. And we moved also on the west side, probably a couple miles from my mom. 

Recording: (3919/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (3920/ 9621) 
 I bet. Yeah. 

Recording: (3921/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3922/ 9621) 
 very much Two-Face, the mother especially. Because I know she's talked about me and stuff. Which hurts my feelings because I'm, I mean I might cause him, you know, I don't cause him. You know, when he's at their house we'll get in an argument and that's what makes him not like me. Because the yelling and stuff. But I feel like I'm not the one that makes him yell. 

Recording: (3923/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3924/ 9621) 
 Oh, you get your choice, Canada. Well, that's... 

Recording: (3925/ 9621) 
 Well, you have an urban area with a lot of poor children, a lot of single parent families, and just the population is changing, period, from the two parent family, the mother not working, into one parent with the mother working. It makes a big difference in how the child does at school. 

Recording: (3926/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3927/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3928/ 9621) 
 So it's just like totally like you know unruined by terrorists and it's not like it ever ran like you know like it's like a lot of these you know like like a whole down in Florida you get like all the almost like all the major cities are just like okay you know strip malls and all that it's like do they have like any of those 

Recording: (3929/ 9621) 
 Kinda, he's kinda, you know, stumble foot still, you know. One and then, you know. 

Recording: (3930/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (3931/ 9621) 
 I just, I matured. I didn't do the stupid things I did. I don't go out much like I used to. I don't go out hardly ever. If I go out, it's just to get out for a minute. Might have a drink. But I don't get drunk, because I always go pick up my son, usually, before I go home. I just, I don't know. I was a teenager, because I had them when I was 21. And I mean, I just pretty much became a homebody. I'm a homebody now. I don't go out. I don't take my kid places and drop him off. He's with me all the time. I don't run around the place. We're at home when I come home from work he's at home with me we don't he goes to bed at 8 and I go to bed by 10 and it's just you know it's just like yeah 

Recording: (3932/ 9621) 
 Basically, because, you know, the open shelter, I don't know whether you've ever been around there, but it isn't a pretty sight, you know. 

Recording: (3933/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (3934/ 9621) 
 She does know that I don't go to church. 

Recording: (3935/ 9621) 
 It was a really long time ago, everything's fine. But I guess for me, I don't know, it was just a little more than I wanted to see. But the classes I think were helpful. But would you ask me? 

Recording: (3936/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (3937/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah. I've been there 20 over 20 years. So yeah, I'm enjoying it. It's always changing. 

Recording: (3938/ 9621) 
 See, I live close to a 

Recording: (3939/ 9621) 
 I'm sure the fact that my parents, my mother tries really hard, but my father was an alcoholic. He was a working alcoholic, so that he insisted he could drink on the weekends and never miss work, et cetera. Yeah, there was no problem. But the biggest problem is the fact that he and I, I've always expected to have some sort of a respect from them, and because they always wanted me to grow up and be independent and think for myself, and so I'm exactly what they always said they wanted, it's just that they can't handle that. And so when I was in seventh grade and I got in a lot of trouble about the whole racial thing because I'm from a school where I was mostly white students were 

Recording: (3940/ 9621) 
 But you can make them aware if somebody as an adult steps over that line or makes them uncomfortable. There should be some kind of a system to where these girls, the slightest bit, it's anonymous, it's, you know. 

Recording: (3941/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my brother didn't know what the heck to do with a checkbook. 

Recording: (3942/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3943/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. We actually were from Columbus, and we moved down to Athens, and they moved back up here when I was in the service. Air Force. I was in 69-72, so then I was in two years' reserves, basically an electronic engineer, not an engineer, but an electronic assembly and stuff like that. A missile systems analyst is what it was called, but they've got these big names for things. 

Recording: (3944/ 9621) 
 To tell you the truth, the school I went to sucked. 

Recording: (3945/ 9621) 
 would be interested in, I mean, not just for the kids' sake, but would be interested on their own behalf in teaching the child what... 

Recording: (3946/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3947/ 9621) 
 어. 

Recording: (3948/ 9621) 
 She was, but I admired her more. Because until the moderates get control of the Republican Party again, that's gonna be the litmus test. It was just like back in the 60s and the 70s when the extreme left wing had control of the Democratic Party. They would nominate such people as McGovern, who I voted for but had no chance of winning. Over the years, I have moderated my hardline, left of center, liberal stance for more of a moderate middle of the road because it's easier to get that sold to the American public. So while I think Dole was correct, I think, yeah, she shot herself in the foot. She would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is, being controlled by the extreme right wing, which is a problem for the Republicans. They need to move towards the middle, which I think George W. is trying to do. Whenever anybody tells me that, I tell them yes, and I'm an indifferent liberal. 

Recording: (3949/ 9621) 
 And they've met the couple that's going to adopt the baby, which seems kind of odd to me. 

Recording: (3950/ 9621) 
 He hasn't for about four years, he refuses to live with us because we have rules. 

Recording: (3951/ 9621) 
 I keep thinking about that all the time, but I'm like, I want something where I can be off during the summer so I can take my kids and we can go out west or, you know, because my wife's in the same boat. She'll retire two years after I do and our kids, you know, will be young. I'm a five-year-old and I only have six years to go, so we're talking 11 years old. 

Recording: (3952/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (3953/ 9621) 
 It's a lot bigger. 

Recording: (3954/ 9621) 
 I've heard it, it hasn't been as, I've heard it from less reputable sources. 

Recording: (3955/ 9621) 
 Okay. I'm thinking people who backpack are pretty cool. 

Recording: (3956/ 9621) 
 I don't think forcing prayer on somebody if they don't believe in it, I don't think that's the right thing to do. 

Recording: (3957/ 9621) 
 No, because they're going to learn that on their own. I personally think that it's a choice. I don't think you're born that way. Because I have friends that are homosexual and I don't believe in what they're doing, but I don't do everything right every day. So I still love them and they're my friends and blah, blah, blah. But I've also known people that were that way and now are heterosexual and are much happier and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that. So it's in today's day and age they're going to learn about it quickly. 

Recording: (3958/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3959/ 9621) 
 Mm hmm. That's a bunch of. That's just one of those myths. I think that's to make people feel guilty or something. 

Recording: (3960/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3961/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Well I think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more. I mean it's smaller compared to most downtowns. I mean you know it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you're out. So I don't think that would hurt anything. And then to live there if they made it more affordable that would be nice. So. 

Recording: (3962/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3963/ 9621) 
 biology experience. 

Recording: (3964/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, then there'd be no desire, yeah. 

Recording: (3965/ 9621) 
 I was in Columbus for the first six years I taught. 

Recording: (3966/ 9621) 
 Oh, oh, wow. Oh, see, and she's probably really good. 

Recording: (3967/ 9621) 
 Sunday. 

Recording: (3968/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (3969/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (3970/ 9621) 
 Amen. 

Recording: (3971/ 9621) 
 No, we used to do 50 cents a game just to win back the quarters and plop them in. Not too much gambling on that part. 

Recording: (3972/ 9621) 
 It is, it was very much high school. 

Recording: (3973/ 9621) 
 But right now, with his attitude the way it is, I'd say that me and my family are better off not having him stirring up a bunch of conflict or whatever. 

Recording: (3974/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3975/ 9621) 
 uh 

Recording: (3976/ 9621) 
 But go on. 

Recording: (3977/ 9621) 
 So there's always something going wrong with the wiring or the plumbing or the something. It seemed like a good idea about 25 years ago to get a house, an older house, but no, not anymore. 

Recording: (3978/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3979/ 9621) 
 They never saw it, they never said anything about it. 

Recording: (3980/ 9621) 
 I don't know, it just sounds like it would be something that I would have to have. It's just necessary. 

Recording: (3981/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (3982/ 9621) 
 It's supposed to be a, let me see, school for art. 

Recording: (3983/ 9621) 
 I want you to be a man, you know, play basketball. 

Recording: (3984/ 9621) 
 Oh, I wish. Yeah, I do it during summer too. I usually work down here. 

Recording: (3985/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (3986/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (3987/ 9621) 
 a whole lot. 

Recording: (3988/ 9621) 
 because like I said it all came together because I don't understand how people can let their kids be hurt. 

Recording: (3989/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3990/ 9621) 
 What they should do is just tell people that their kids don't get to go to school. I bet the attitude changes pretty fast. 

Recording: (3991/ 9621) 
 I don't know if there's any particular, I think if someone knows, if anyone knew of something like that going on, they would 

Recording: (3992/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3993/ 9621) 
 And I think if we could just keep that going into middle school. 

Recording: (3994/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I could skip any program I wanted to. You know, just show up at the parties, basically. 

Recording: (3995/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (3996/ 9621) 
 She wears high heels. Why would she wear high heels? 

Recording: (3997/ 9621) 
 mom and sister move out to California. 

Recording: (3998/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (3999/ 9621) 
 The Milk Italian. 

Recording: (4000/ 9621) 
 Clintonville. 

Recording: (4001/ 9621) 
 I hate to be in the predicament of having to change anything. It would be hard to change for one group and not another. 

Recording: (4002/ 9621) 
 as opposed to what the Catholic Church actually thinks is correct. 

Recording: (4003/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it can be a problem if you get hit. 

Recording: (4004/ 9621) 
 Oh, I think the society in general is declining in a lot of ways. Our morals are declining and our intelligence level, maybe not level, I mean IQs are still high, but people are settling for less. I have a big sign in my room that says, never settle for less than your very best. Because I really think people are getting lazy, even adults. We don't even want to wait 25 seconds for microwave popcorn. We're getting impatient 

Recording: (4005/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4006/ 9621) 
 Oh is that right? 

Recording: (4007/ 9621) 
 Probably Northwest area. 

Recording: (4008/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? I was like, whoa, milk and Twizzlers. 

Recording: (4009/ 9621) 
 And some of them did, and some of them were just complete idiots, but you find that anywhere. 

Recording: (4010/ 9621) 
 The tail, okay. 

Recording: (4011/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (4012/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (4013/ 9621) 
 The accents sometimes, but they're okay. No big problem. But the accent sometimes, it's like a sort of a running joke. I don't know if I should say this, but it's like, if I can talk like this and talk all the time like this, why is it that they can't talk like we do? If I could talk that way, because we do have pilots that do talk like 

Recording: (4014/ 9621) 
 It's like, let's go, come on. Well, yeah, because I had lots of epidural because they induced me. My doctor said, hey, it's time. We can do this. So I got it lucky, even though I kind of wanted it to have it normal. 

Recording: (4015/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (4016/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (4017/ 9621) 
 issues. So, you know, that's one thing that I hope that they work on. 

Recording: (4018/ 9621) 
 Well, it would have been something that they would have supported and something that I would have probably been pretty good at. 

Recording: (4019/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (4020/ 9621) 
 What's bad about where I work at, it's not so much racism as, whereas if you're my supervisor, I'm just using this example, and I do something wrong. 

Recording: (4021/ 9621) 
 She read my notes and all that. 

Recording: (4022/ 9621) 
 So I made a lot of stupid, you know, you look back and you see things, you're like, this is real obvious. But at the time, I think youth, I was like, A, I can either change them. Or if they love me, we can communicate and change things and you know, that type of thing. 

Recording: (4023/ 9621) 
 And then you come here, you know what I mean? You see people stand out on street corners with signs, work for food. 

Recording: (4024/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I think it's possible. It'd have to take the right combination of someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people. I think Dole would have been a good candidate. I would have been hard pressed. Some of her issues I don't like, but when she came out and said her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns, she went up a couple of notches in my estimation, because I wasn't sure where she'd be. I thought she'd have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline Republicans, and then I wouldn't have been able to vote for her. 

Recording: (4025/ 9621) 
 And she's very determined. She has said that being pregnant and having these babies made her focus on things a lot differently. She doesn't want to go back to being the way she was before. She doesn't want to go back to the drugs and the smoking and the drinking. 

Recording: (4026/ 9621) 
 great guy but he sure liked to get drunk you know and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk 

Recording: (4027/ 9621) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (4028/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4029/ 9621) 
 Right, right, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (4030/ 9621) 
 Yeah, being a nurse, the wife, that helps a lot, because that's what that thing was really functioning around, was nurses, getting them some good daycare, because they work all these wild shifts and stuff. So that's how it first started. Before, it wasn't even on campus. It was over on like 4th or Summit in a church when it first started. But it's just not, people were always saying, I can't believe how much you pay for daycare. And I'm like, but look what we're getting, you know. People take their kids to somebody's neighbor's house and the lady can be sitting them in front of the TV. 

Recording: (4031/ 9621) 
 then they were raised and they are. But I told her I you know there is I will never be married if my man's gonna be cheating on me. I won't marry him. 

Recording: (4032/ 9621) 
 And he just pretty much cut ties with all of his old friends. We still see them a lot. And we were close with their parents. 

Recording: (4033/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4034/ 9621) 
 Oh I see. Well that'd be a good way I would think. 

Recording: (4035/ 9621) 
 A whole lot more places to live. It seems like everywhere I turn there's construction and you know, you go down one road and then you wait a couple years if you don't go in that area and it's all changed. It looks all different. So and that's mainly like looking up Bethel and 315, Knorr, things like that. 

Recording: (4036/ 9621) 
 Yeah. OK. 

Recording: (4037/ 9621) 
 Get it from us. 

Recording: (4038/ 9621) 
 I defended my stepmother against the rest of my family immediately following my father's death because there was some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother. So my sister and I defended my stepmother against the rest of my family. Stepmother eventually shafted us, and so stepmother is evil. 

Recording: (4039/ 9621) 
 Right. And then they wonder why, you know, I don't know what's happened. It's the other person who's changed, you know. And if you start changing your behavior, you can usually get the kinds of changes. I always figure if you treat people the way that old golden rule thing, if you give out what you want back, you get it. 

Recording: (4040/ 9621) 
 I play lottery once in a while if I have a couple bucks on me. And, uh, well, football games, we won't even start with that. 

Recording: (4041/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think it was. 

Recording: (4042/ 9621) 
 Make a lot of salads. 

Recording: (4043/ 9621) 
 Look at her, she's so terrific. Watch her go. 

Recording: (4044/ 9621) 
 now I am have very little contact with them and so that the last thing I think okay where are we 

Recording: (4045/ 9621) 
 Really? Yeah, I don't feel old at all. I mean, I, you know, a lot of people think, wow, you should know what you want to do or, you know, and I guess there is different phases like Maslow's hierarchy. What is that? The hierarchy of needs? Maslow? Anyway. 

Recording: (4046/ 9621) 
 Whereabouts of Steve? 

Recording: (4047/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (4048/ 9621) 
 here in high school. Ecstasy is a drug I've been hearing about a lot the past year or two and it's definitely something that's grown 

Recording: (4049/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (4050/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4051/ 9621) 
 multiple health problems. He ran away for a while. There was drug abuse, alcohol, and he was essentially asked to leave high school. 

Recording: (4052/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and only for like a brief period. 

Recording: (4053/ 9621) 
 And I worked there a year, and I just couldn't deal with it no more. I couldn't deal with never seeing my kid, because I did work five days a week, and then every third Saturday I worked also, which I made good money. And I need to make that kind of money again, but I'm happier. 

Recording: (4054/ 9621) 
 And he looks more like that side of the family. And he was born, we couldn't believe it. We didn't know there was redheads on my husband's side of the family. And then we found out that he had a great-grandfather with red hair and blue eyes. 

Recording: (4055/ 9621) 
 I love read magazines and my wife loves read magazines because I love all the car magazines. And they're a fortune. And they're all at the library. You know, it's like people just don't, you pay all these taxes and you don't use this stuff. I mean, the library has CDs. I mean, my thing now is in traffic everybody gets all upset that this big road rage crap, you know, which is just, I have this stuff to slap a couple of them people. But anyway, and what I do is I go to the library on my day off and I get two or three books on tape. And when I'm sitting there I go, oh good, it's a traffic jam and I'm not moving as I'm 

Recording: (4056/ 9621) 
 that like the parental influence isn't as much as, you know, before then. I think by the time that you are past adolescence. 

Recording: (4057/ 9621) 
 I had foreign 

Recording: (4058/ 9621) 
 You're a woman, you're a minority. 

Recording: (4059/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (4060/ 9621) 
 They did. They didn't come every day, but they came occasionally and it helped. And we mopped our own floor, like on the hall a few times. We just basically need the bathrooms done. 

Recording: (4061/ 9621) 
 or they don't know who Eeyore is. 

Recording: (4062/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (4063/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like you share your spoon, you know, or you share, you know, you get, you know, like an extra blanket. I would think, you know, hey, you know, you need something, you need this or that. 

Recording: (4064/ 9621) 
 I don't know. Those kids are, they lack something in their upbringing and I don't know what it is. Thank goodness none of my kids ever took that sort of attitude. I'd like to think that my wife and I set them a good example. My wife was a very conscientious, hardworking woman. She established a secretarial business there at her home for several years. And anything that went out of there was right. I mean, and she did quite a lot of typing for students over here, graduate students. 

Recording: (4065/ 9621) 
 And then one day, my two sisters, Older and I, Bernice and Frances, and I were outside playing and Bernice, I don't know whether it was Bernice or me, but one of us said, well, let's go down and wade in the lake. 

Recording: (4066/ 9621) 
 No, now I live with my husband in Grandview and I've lived in all different parts of Clintonville.

 Um, really anything. Like right now I'm just painting and they laugh at me because I went the other day and found some chairs that were that badly and asked if I could have them cleaned them up and I'm painting those and things like that. So

 They know more knowledge. I wouldn't say they're more socially mature or more, I mean, there's even sweet little preschool girls that don't say please and thank you. You know, you have to remind them.

 Actually, I live in Clintonville now and it's real convenient, but the houses are so old and I'm just tired of living in an old house.

 Most of them at our site, now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect others. People connect us and then go out. There's a gateway to other places. We're getting more into that now. But that wasn't so easy before either, the web again. 

Recording: (4080/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (4081/ 9621) 
 The parents have so much responsibility, but the kid has so much responsibility, and then society has so much responsibility. So, you know what I mean? Basically, all I've ever seen is, well, like these kids that get in the house, they go to their house, they find a gun, and they want to hold the parents responsible. Yes and no on that. If the parents had the gun in the house, and they had the ammunition locked up, say, in the trunk of their car, what if the kid brought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun? 

Recording: (4082/ 9621) 
 or I got to drive you know further north. There's not any like really good businesses right around where I live. That's the only thing. So I think they need to come in you know read you know get the downtown going. When I was a kid I loved to go downtown. 

Recording: (4083/ 9621) 
 I'm not afraid. 

Recording: (4084/ 9621) 
 I'm just saying, you know. 

Recording: (4085/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

 Yeah.

 That would be fine, but again, I don't... It's just another person with a different lifestyle. It's like, they're the same as me, it's just... 

Recording: (4096/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4097/ 9621) 
 No, I just basically got out of a relationship. It was like a rebound type thing. I was in a relationship for like three years. And he was cheating on me. And so I felt really bad. And why does he pick her? And then I met this guy who seemed wonderful and then turned out to be not so wonderful.

Recording: (4102/ 9621) 
 I would either go back in languages or actually I'm a psychology undergraduate so yeah. 

Recording: (4103/ 9621) 
 Because like I think it's Archie Griffin that went to a really crummy school in Columbus. And to me, no matter how bad of an area you live in and bad a school you think you're going to, if you want to do it, you can. Because really in Columbus public schools, if you have a learning disability or if you have problems reading or you have problems at home, there is a psychologist or a tutor or something to help you. And in like Worthington and Westerville, Dublin, you know, they don't have the money to throw away. And like Catholic schools, they don't have the money to put on those programs. So some of those people kind of get pushed aside. And so, you know, as you can see, I'm staying in my soapbox here. I do like Columbus Public Schools, but, you know, I hate when people say, you know, look at these test scores because it really doesn't reflect What's there because it's like saying all kids carry guns to school? They don't you know the media says well? What is there been like maybe five or six people who have taken guns to school and killed people? What about the millions and millions of kids that go to school every day do their homework? And you know do community service and stuff well. It's just too boring. We don't want to hear that stuff. That irritates me. 

Recording: (4104/ 9621) 
 We did a lot of searching when we bought our house. It's hard to find what you want in a house and get the school system to. You get into Arlington, you get into Grandview, places like this, or Bexley, and the price range we were in, you were gonna have to dump 50,000 into the houses just to get them up. We had a list of what we wanted in a house, and our house was only 17 years old when we bought it, but it had everything we wanted. Fireplace, full dry basement, you know, two and a half car garage, you know, all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses, wet basements, garage burned down, you know, the lots were packed. So we live on a golf course and have a creek in the backyard. And so's really yeah I don't yeah they play in the creek they don't play golf yet. 

Recording: (4105/ 9621) 
 I don't know, you know Columbus is so saturated with golf courses and my parents all through growing up they played golf and I really was interested in it. I just think enough's enough though. Yeah, there's so many.

 Clinton's position on it? Well he sort of backed down from what it was going to be and then just hoped that it would drop and I mean what you hear and read lately is that it really hasn't changed much. But again that's I think part of that too is society's not ready at some level to accept that. And gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages and 

Recording: (4111/ 9621) 
 Correct. 

Recording: (4112/ 9621) 
 Those are the mass people. You gotta find out and figure out what needs they're gonna roll into. Like when they get older, you know, you get into the wheelchair companies or something. Somewhere it's just gonna be massive.

 Probably a little bit.

 Yeah.

 and what they say that we've done to the language and everything else, and you're not a typical American, but, you know, and then the next hour and a half they just say how bad Americans are, and you kind of think, well, thanks for the exclusion, but you still have been insulting me for an hour and a half. 

Recording: (4116/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well it's gotten a lot worse. When I say a lot worse, because you say you don't have kids. I got a kid 23 years old and there was no place for him to play. 

Recording: (4117/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (4118/ 9621) 
 Well, it's not just in the schools, it's in society. I mean, violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things. It's hard to imagine that there's an easy fix, or if there is a fix. It's kind of frustrating, because you can't point to one thing and say, this is what needs to be fixed. Again, it's pervasive. I's like the, I don't know if you heard about this in the news, a woman, two women were having an argument, one of them set fire to the other one. 

Recording: (4119/ 9621) 
 Did he really? 

Recording: (4120/ 9621) 
 Okay, I thought well what you guys like some 

Recording: (4121/ 9621) 
 He never said much about it except he told about one time when he was in a hospital up in Japan after he was burned. He said that he was in a ward with a bunch of other burn patients and he said that some of them, him included, were able to get up and walk around. So the—and I can see their philosophy. The medics had the guys that could walk help wait on the guys that were bed-bound. And he was—had been helping one guy that was pretty bad off this guy passed away Didn't make it and so they started to put on get on to Do something else. Well, some of the other guys I'm through I'm not working anymore with him. He told him and it's why yes you are What are to do, send me back over to Vietnam? But they sent him home. But he was not a very enthusiastic soldier, I don't think, at any time, and especially after he came home. 

Recording: (4122/ 9621) 
 And that was very stressful. 

Recording: (4123/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4124/ 9621) 
 And so, shortly after he was healed enough to go back to work, they were married.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4154/ 9621) 
 Okay, fine. And the family probably said, okay, we want your advancement, we want your goodwill. The problem is, you ran into culture differences. Culture differences over here and so forth. And then we became a little more promiscuous. And so gee, you know, mom, dad and so forth, they don't know what's going on here in the West Coast with us, you know, and so forth. And they think everything's going okay, because we didn't have communication as frequent. And then all of a sudden you find out, and usually mom found out, geez, something doesn't sound right through the airways or through the writing. Something's mysterious going on here. And you found out they're having difficulties. Well, divorce became acceptable. Before it was a no-no. Now it's acceptable. And then you had the celebrities becoming more known. Oh, hey, we don't get married anymore. No, okay. Then we have the idea of doing away with cash. Gold metallic, the metallic backing, I think it was Kennedy was the one that did that. And said, we'll just print promissory notes. And so now we keep credit. We buy ourselves out of every dilemma in the world and saying well hey we'll just pay you more. We pay you more country then fine. But every time they print more it makes the money in your investment less. But hey who cares huh that's what they've 

Recording: (4155/ 9621)

 Yes.

 I'm not sure. 

Recording: (4160/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (4161/ 9621) 
 Excuse me. 

Recording: (4162/ 9621) 
 I was like a rebel. It wasn't really my cup of tea. Actually, I had a pretty decent job. I worked four and a half days a week, basically in the electro-mechanical type of things, remove and replace, what they do a lot now with cars. They put a thing on a machine and it says, take that out, try it, and you put that in. So in hindsight, you know, it was cool. But I had, I liked the long hair. It was back in the 60s, so, you know. 

Recording: (4163/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4164/ 9621) 
 Which, I mean, isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely something that's noticeable in there. 

Recording: (4165/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4166/ 9621) 
 I don't think that I would have them go to any, I learned things like how to speak French, how to set a dinner table, how to throw a hot tub party. That kind of stuff was a lot more focused than, I mean, I didn't even, I don't think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my parents. So I mean, it was interesting. I mean, it was a lot more cultural kinds of things. You do a lot of things with nature and that kind of stuff. It was the the 70s too. So I mean you have to look at the time what we're talking about. But I feel like, I don't see why I wouldn't send them to public schools. 

Recording: (4167/ 9621) 
 Do you? 

Recording: (4168/ 9621) 
 The public transit system, I mean, I know they're doing the best they can, but I don't see how we're ever gonna get out of this without light rail. And I'm really bummed. 

Recording: (4169/ 9621) 
 Yeah, avoiding mistakes is pretty much what they need to do. Better decisions that help.

 from high school and I won in that original group of kids that I had, never did pass them all. But I guess he's not worried because he's going to work with his dad and his dad's business. So he's going to be okay, but he never did pass the reading and the writing. He passed everything else. But, and the questions aren't the same. I mean, there's several different forms. Every time they send out the test, it's sealed in a box and nobody is allowed to open it but the principal and then he has to distribute it to the teachers and so the questions could change. 

Recording: (4175/ 9621) 
 do my billing and stuff. Microsoft money. 

Recording: (4176/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (4177/ 9621) 
 Well, then I think she probably took her girlfriends out to the mall, you know, and partied a little bit with their McDonald's and everything. That's one thing I see about kids doing nowadays a lot too is socializing like at shopping malls and things of that nature. 

Recording: (4178/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4179/ 9621) 
 Yeah, Hoosier. Yeah, so things pretty much in Columbus Public Schools, they don't actually sit down with you. They automatically assume that once you get to this level, you're ready for this level and you go on. 

Recording: (4180/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I had a cousin that went on, she was in school for that. And as you can tell, I like to do office work. 

Recording: (4181/ 9621) 
 That's what I was actually thinking of, where he takes the pictures on the corner. 

Recording: (4182/ 9621) 
 now. And it was just taking her out of her, you know, where she, you know, you grow up hearing those lies and 

Recording: (4183/ 9621) 
 Really. 

Recording: (4184/ 9621) 
 How appalling. Oh yeah. Yeah. My my family my mom especially is just like when are you going to stop doing that. Yeah because he's 16 months now and I think he's tapering off quite a bit. So I think that he'll be done soon but I'm not pushing him. So 

Recording: (4185/ 9621) 
 You should. You should be organized. I'm not. I have this stack of, like, groceries maybe about a foot high sitting next to my bed. I just remember when I went out and bought groceries and then the commons opened again. 

Recording: (4186/ 9621) 
 I mean you just never know, how freaky. 

Recording: (4187/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4188/ 9621) 
 I'm sure, yeah. I mean, he doesn't throw women in her face, no women call the house or anything. You never know what, she doesn't, you know, question him about where he's been or anything like that. She just, I just can't believe that. I just think that's terrible. 

Recording: (4189/ 9621) 
 Oh, that's it. 

Recording: (4190/ 9621) 
 And it is, it is. It's kind of an oasis in the middle of the city. 

Recording: (4191/ 9621) 
 Yeah, not me, it's too expensive. 

Recording: (4192/ 9621) 
 It's more feasible than a six-year-old. 

Recording: (4193/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4194/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. So, you know, once you get to a certain degree of frustration, you need to relieve that somehow. So that's pretty much why we moved. 

Recording: (4195/ 9621) 
 I've always thought that it ends up being a personal decision. 

Recording: (4196/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4197/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4198/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (4199/ 9621) 
 And they see the same thing smeared back to them because we're making Christ's images and we can't say no to him. That's what heaven's like. That's what we should go to bed at night thinking what did we do positive today and build on the positive. It may have been the smallest part of that sheet of paper. 

Recording: (4200/ 9621) 
 But she was never interested in boys or in sports in high school or makeup and clothes and things like that. You're setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that. And that's what happened. She'd come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff. And finally, she just stopped going. And within a couple of months, she got her GED. 

Recording: (4201/ 9621) 
 How old were you there? And so, what do you stop? I was going through divorce parents both parents passed away My ex moved to st. Louis and didn't tell me anything about her foreclosure on the house and that's how I found out she moved and just a bunch of shit, I just started screwing up so they wanted to put me on probation and my Rebellious attitude or whatever said I quit That's pretty stupid really 

Recording: (4202/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (4203/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're really good about that. 

Recording: (4204/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (4205/ 9621) 
 Those were the good old days. That's a good day. That's when you used to own them too. You could trade them. That's when we lost our rights. There's some things that are traditional there. Capital T and some are low T. Low case T. And you're talking about low case T. I'm talking about capital T. 

Recording: (4206/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (4207/ 9621) 
 I was going then relate to a comment that she made about I believe in the electric chair. I believe in capital punishment. But that was one comment she was talking about. But then on the very very opposite extreme extreme opposite we talk about the love of the child from the day of birth. And this may seem to be contradictory. And I'm not quite sure how to address that. Because some people would say, now wait a minute, you're talking out of both sides of your mouth, the expression is. How can you say over here you must have the love of this child in your arms arms and then over here you're saying you believe in capital punishment and electrocution. 

Recording: (4208/ 9621) 
 I think example is probably the best. They see that you care and they learn to care. I think my son John, he's the youngest, I think he's a very compassionate soul, a very spiritual young man, more so than his brother is. And I always have tapped away that, you know, they say that sometimes you give because it makes you feel better to give. And I sometimes try to weigh that if that's part of why. I can't believe it's an attention-getter because there's nothing to be gained by getting attention for the works you do. But maybe just within, maybe one feels. And I think it's a matter of being conscientious too, you know, conscientious that there are 

Recording: (4209/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (4210/ 9621) 
 It's quite possible, but we picked the daycare that I thought was closest to well The one that was open that had the closest values that we had I personally would like a church-based program, but there aren't any well there weren't any open when we were looking for one we did have the option of going here to OSU to their daycare and It has a wonderful reputation and everybody that I've talked to that has had children there is very pleased with the program. But what I didn't like was so that they weren't imparting values on the children, they don't celebrate any holidays at all. So they just kind of ignore everything. Where he is now, I still like getting my Mother's Day card. I mean they're doing the trick or treat thing on Thursday. They're going door to door. They get a dress up. He wouldn't have gotten any of that at OSU. And there are pros and cons to both of those. 

Recording: (4211/ 9621) 
 I beat to getting a second job. 

Recording: (4212/ 9621) 
 like it's okay i mean it's like a country school which was always over to as i was like me and my friends were always like the way because i used to have real long hair and so that was like i used to be like a big hippie or whatever and like um... that was i guess weird kinda like being the odd people and in a small like in a small midwestern farming school is kind of odd i guess um... 

Recording: (4213/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4214/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I loved 161. I loved it around there. I loved all those cool restaurants and everything. 

Recording: (4215/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (4216/ 9621) 
 And getting back to the profanity and stuff, that was another one was in the paper. Some of the parents are not leading the children right. And it was about this mother and father was doing something all once their little kid maybe six or seven or eight walked in there and said, what the H, the four letter word? It says four. And the father's standing and looks at him and after the kids walked out says, well, where in the H did that child learn to talk like that? So you see he gave himself away right away. So you see it's the ones that are teaching the kids. And it's all those things that I've mentioned before. But I think that really it goes back to that. What can we do to change it? I think as I said, basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person and what's good for everybody, not just me, me, me.

 Mmm.

 You know, they can do whatever they want.

 the proficiency tests that they're now requiring. You can't graduate from an Ohio high school with a diploma unless you pass all the proficiency tests. And that means you have to take one in citizenship, which is like government and history, one in math, one in science, one in writing, and one in reading. And you have, you can try to pass the first time at the end of the eighth grade, then you get two tries in the ninth grade, two tries in the tenth, two in the eleventh, and two in the twelfth. You can take them as many times as you need to take them, but if you don't pass them all by the time you graduate, you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate. It's not a real diploma. It's like, okay, I attended. I didn't learn anything, but I was there. 

Recording: (4220/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so, mm-hmm, right. 

Recording: (4221/ 9621) 
 Under the conditions that had to prevail, I was treated well enough.

 I mean, she gets up, she gets up, it wakes her up at five o'clock and she does it all day. I never, I never peeped not once. I was, but it was like the feelings like I'm hungry right now that bothered me because I wasn't like a real heavy eater. And then all of a sudden it's like I want to eat that and that and that, get me this and it was crazy. It was weird. 

Recording: (4223/ 9621) 
 I don't think it's made us any better or any worse. 

Recording: (4224/ 9621) 
 or so. 

Recording: (4225/ 9621) 
 But yeah, they got people we had no manager say for three months. So of course, they took somebody that they're going to lay off, put them in a management position, they're making $80,000 a year.

 I think you just have to treat children like they're just, just you have to respect them and you have to not talk down to them and that whole thing about, you know, why can't I do this? Well, because I told you so.

 making information available. So I think it's attracting a different group of people and it's more interesting. But it was a real tough job market then, so I ended up at the State Library downtown. Worked there for five years and decided there wasn't anything else there for me. And got a job at this company, OCLC, which was still relatively new. There were like 100, 150 employees.

 I can't imagine not doing it that way. I mean, personally, I don't know. There's so much I know about him and things I trust because I've known him forever. I don't think people are as honest and truthful these days. I don't know.

 So they spend all these thousands of dollars on airfare and they're still coming out ahead. Maybe they should get to one of those Las Vegas chapel weddings and do like a drive-thru. If they really want to do it on the cheap, and have Elvis perform the ceremony. That's crazy. 

Recording: (4251/ 9621) 
 you know, it clears you, purifies you. That's what it was for. That's what the people used it for, purification. And even it's made up of four rounds, usually sometimes three. And the last round is usually called the purification round, where whoever's pouring the sweat, the spiritual air that's pouring the sweat, it'll make it tough on you.

 Take care of us.

 There's this one that's like out in Wisconsin or something she said and it was really nice and she had been there like a couple of times and she says they should put one right there. She said that'll make up for it. 

Recording: (4264/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4265/ 9621) 
 So that was real nice. And I was her maid of honor when they got married. It was just, I was real cringe about this bag, but.

 Oh yeah.

 Yeah. 

Recording: (4274/ 9621) 
 They were out of it. 

Recording: (4275/ 9621) 
 over that, right. 

Recording: (4276/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4277/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. Passed through it. Random jobs for 

Recording: (4278/ 9621) 
 And I have an office within the program now. And it's just incredible how much I've learned. I think I learned more in that program than I do in all my classes put together. 

Recording: (4279/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (4280/ 9621) 
 Did you really? You went maybe even to their ward. That's funny. They're the f*** not that you would know them. 

Recording: (4281/ 9621) 
 They're just like, hmm, everybody else is taking double E's. But I'm having fun over here doing this computer science thing and happy joy. Yeah. 

Recording: (4282/ 9621) 
 Now about the same age. 

Recording: (4283/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4284/ 9621) 
 Ours does that too. They're great. 

Recording: (4285/ 9621) 
 Yeah, definitely. 

Recording: (4286/ 9621) 
 So, you know what I mean? We had more fun on our own. Where I grew up, I grew up like I said right over here on Old Tangy. There used to be a pond over here at the cemetery. We used to go fishing there every day. 

Recording: (4287/ 9621) 
 in the business world. In other words, I used to work during high school days for a furniture company and in those days it was 90 days cash and we'd sell it to people and we'd just, and we'd talk to the manager, oh they don't have the money, it's financed through the bank. Well why are we selling it to them then? Well we'll get our money back and the bank will get their money and we'll repossess it. And we sold the same darn thing over three or four times. Those poor suckers out there get stuck with credit ratings. The bank's making money, we're making money, they're losing. Now is that business ethics? I ask you, is it? Is it proper business ethics? 

Recording: (4288/ 9621) 
 Drawing and painting is my major. And I like doing all sorts of different things. I haven't even had any painting classes yet. So it's kind of funny. I'm taking sculpture and drawing. And next quarter, I have a painting class. Yeah. Right. 

Recording: (4289/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and it's not, I mean, any is too much, but it's not that big a proportion that it's happening. But I remember even my son, third grade, somebody, a kid brought a gun to school. 

Recording: (4290/ 9621) 
 Right. Right. When it's just frustration after frustration. Yeah. Yeah. But I don't see that in the Catholic school. Now in the Catholic school, they're not even paid as well as the public schools. But the environment is better for education. 

Recording: (4291/ 9621) 
 XD 

Recording: (4292/ 9621) 
 since I said it. It's okay. 

Recording: (4293/ 9621) 
 And this is the first time in my whole life that I haven't been working. And it's just like, my mom and I go out to lunch and we go to breakfast. And we go, Jason, what'd you do today? Well, I went to breakfast with my mom. And then Amy and I went to lunch. And then we, you know, and I actually, we moved about three months ago. So I've been kind of doing a lot of stuff at our place. So that's nice. I mean, I've had a lot of time to get everything in wallpaper and painted and just do all those kinds of things. But it's weird, you know, because I don't have to get up in the morning and I feel guilty, you know, he leaves at 630 or 7 and I'm going, bye, have a nice day, you know, and I'm still sleeping, which is right now is really good because I have a hard time sleeping at night and after he leaves, it's wonderful because I can sleep until about 1030 and I feel a lot better. 

Recording: (4294/ 9621) 
 I don't know. Sometimes it's like, it's sometimes, um, it's, yeah, it's like messing around with people. Like, um, sometimes like, uh, like if I don't feel like taking the calls or whatever, like, uh, like I won't listen to what the people are saying. And I'll be like, yep, yep. Like, no, we don't, we don't have that or something like that.

 And I was there three months before I got hit with a racial discrimination suit. But then I found out later this woman had, in the 20 years she'd been there, had filed 20 suits.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4299/ 9621) 
 No. No. 

Recording: (4300/ 9621) 
 I'd like to eventually, in the immediate future, get something more permanent as far as work goes, a better standard of living. I'm a veteran, so I got healthcare, but I need to get some other things done. Continue to grow in wisdom as far as maybe spirituality or something. And eventually get my own business where I have a want that I want to get a spiritual bookstore and have things for everybody. Just come in and reading room, browse, you know, read the stuff, you know, take time off to relax because I think one of the problems with stress is, and I think people are right in saying that we don't get enough exercise, but I think you have to exercise the mentality once in a while too and that is trying to make it grow into other levels of atmosphere. 

Recording: (4301/ 9621) 
 Um, probably for the most part. I mean, as long as they have a political background of some sort, I can't say I see any real difference. I mean, for the most part, they've proven to be able to do anything else any guy can do. So. 

Recording: (4302/ 9621) 
 Well, this is about giving opinions and my opinion about the Columbus Public School System really isn't good. 

Recording: (4303/ 9621) 
 Well, that's what everybody... When I tell people I play it, that's what everybody says, but it seems to me that any instrument can be hard, depending. I mean, I can't see how anybody can play a clarinet, for example. But there are some things that are hard about playing the French horn. One is that you can play many different notes with a single fingering. 

Recording: (4304/ 9621) 
 to get more cosmopolitan. 

Recording: (4305/ 9621) 
 I think that we both, I think collectively together, I know Jason likes me a little bit better, but I don't know about boys' names. He said one when I was about three months that we both really liked, but names weren't really what we were thinking about then. 

Recording: (4306/ 9621) 
 She was originally from Southern Ohio, but while I was gone, she came to Columbus, and so I came here when I was discharged. And I served an apprenticeship in a sheet metal worker's shop, or well, it was more than just, I mean, it was more than shop work. We did erection work too, and commercial work. And I stayed with that till, well, for 25 years, whenever that was. Then I got a chance to go to work for the city of Columbus as a heating and ventilating inspector. And I decided that it was, that was more my speed when when I was that age so I worked for them, for the city as inspector for 12 and a half years until I retired. And my wife and I had four children, three boys and a daughter. My sons all live here in Columbus and my daughter is out in Seattle in the Redmond area. I've been active in church work, Sunday school all my life. 

Recording: (4307/ 9621) 
 Well I think it starts with the family but the problem is in the last 30 years we've emphasized, I shouldn't say 30 years, post-World War II. Post-World War II is where we broke the family up. And let me tell you how I analyze this. During World War II we took the little lady out of the house and said, hey, we need you on the production lines making war machineries. 

Recording: (4308/ 9621) 
 And it's just like been, so for him too, this has been a real amazing road because by the time he was 28, he had four kids. And yet we managed to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this kind of time we have. Now he's looking forward to, he's thrilled about the baby that my daughter's gonna have. But I would have had a whole lot more kids. I would have just kept having them. And he said, I'll force plenty. He needed a break. 

Recording: (4309/ 9621) 
 If... 

Recording: (4310/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (4311/ 9621) 
 Really see we almost think that that would be better, but when you put it like that it's certainly 

Recording: (4312/ 9621) 
 My friends 

Recording: (4313/ 9621) 
 I'm like, got you. 

Recording: (4314/ 9621)

 But now he's with that girl he was cheating on with. He's with her now. They live together. So he's like going through a pattern too. And I he's a very they're like the real nice people. It's just they just I you know feel like they don't. And I try to tell him you know don't mess up again. I just like grow up. Grow up. 

Recording: (4318/ 9621) 
 Right, yeah, the middle of May is when they usually start most of this stuff. So the HVAC, is that high volume? Heating, cooling, and ventilation. Heating, cooling, and ventilation. 

Recording: (4319/ 9621) 
 I have become visually desensitized to the violence that I see in movies and on TV, but I still see a distinct difference between that and real violence. I mean, in studying history, I'm exposed to a number of rather gruesome events in history that still are very, I still find disturbing. Also, hang out in little life bars and every once in a while there'll be a fight and it still is disturbing to me. I have a distinct difference in my head between reality and fiction. And maybe kids aren't making that distinction, but I don't think so. And I think if someone isn't making that distinction, it's... I don't know, I don't have any evidence to support it. I just know that I feel that I have a distinct, a very clear distinction between what is Fact and what is fiction? What is true and was imaginary and? So for me, I don't think that television has affected me in that way I mean one way that television has affected me is I Am full of media references when I speak. When I'm hanging out with friends, someone mentions a subject and I'm like, hey, Simpsons made fun of that at some point. That's the effect that it sees on me. I don't think that's too big an effect people are always used to you know like quote Shakespeare or something I guess that's ten times more elevated so like References the Shakespeare line or something, but I mean it's a part of our culture, and I'm a part of it and 

Recording: (4320/ 9621) 
 But we're working on it. We've got a couple of house bills in right now and see how things go. 

Recording: (4321/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I guess I just felt like, I don't know, I was thinking that's kinda neat. And if you're looking at traffic, and I could see if I was going downtown and coming back, the amount of money that you pay to park downtown is outrageous. Even just having to, it takes, I knew when it was snowing, because I worked on Front Street, and where I come from, I live on Bethel Road, which is, I'd take Bethel to 315 through downtown and it would take me an hour and 45 minutes in the snow to get down there. And if I could jump on this rail system and it would take me 15 minutes and I wouldn't have to pay $50 a month for parking, why not do that? And there's also the whole pollution thing and those types of things, so I thought that was 

Recording: (4322/ 9621) 
 because of your internal clock. 

Recording: (4323/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (4324/ 9621) 
 And my oldest son completed what they call the God and Country Award in the church, which requires about as much work as the Eagle Award in the Scouts. It's a Scout-sponsored but church-centered award. And then my second son got his Eagle Award in Scouts. I'm kind of proud of that because it's not something that a lot of kids do. 

Recording: (4325/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4326/ 9621) 
 I didn't like it, but I liked elements of it. Unlike the first Star Wars movie, this one really is meant to be part of a trilogy. The first Star Wars movie, when it came out, it was in many ways an experiment. It was part of a larger story. 

Recording: (4327/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4328/ 9621) 
 My mom. 

Recording: (4329/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (4330/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (4331/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4332/ 9621) 
 But she always put me first, and I think that that made it a lot more positive for me. 

Recording: (4333/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4334/ 9621) 
 when Northland moves and all that, that the existing building, she thinks they should turn into a discount store. 

Recording: (4335/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. They say it's going to be hard to do in some of the other states, but I don't think so. 

Recording: (4336/ 9621) 
 Well, that's the problem, I think.

 Yeah.

Recording: (4344/ 9621) 
 It hurt too! 

Recording: (4345/ 9621) 
 They get so, they're just so poor and they, and we felt sometimes like we could help them but they didn't want any help and it was kind of hard to just say, okay, well, I did what I could. 

Recording: (4346/ 9621) 
 That's about right. That's about right. I think it's intro vitriol. Intro vitriol. That's all it is. 

Recording: (4347/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4348/ 9621) 
 I can't see a lot of substance. He seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then, not really backtrack, it's just like it's not anything really firm. I mean, with McCain and Bradley, they were saying they wanted to do this and this was the points they wanted to make, and I don't hear that coming from Bush. 

Recording: (4349/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she did that yesterday. 

Recording: (4350/ 9621) 
 So am I. I missed your question before that. 

Recording: (4351/ 9621) 
 They had to walk and I knew where they went. And that was it. They didn't have the TV programs they have now. They had more programs that were actually like, I can't think of some of the names of them anymore.

 Mm-hmm.

 Yes.

 I say you should look in the newspaper and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years.

 there.

 came and played there one time. That was a teen club. 

Recording: (4358/ 9621) 
 And then yeah, I got the opportunity, a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back. 

Recording: (4359/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4360/ 9621) 
 No, not like they used to. 

Recording: (4361/ 9621) 
 It's just sad in our society that that's what it's turning to. 

Recording: (4362/ 9621) 
 And 

Recording: (4363/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's usually about a third or something. And do most of them live on campus? I think maybe two thirds of them live on campus. It's just basically getting out of the house. 

Recording: (4364/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4365/ 9621) 
 The personal thing is you need to have ethics. 

Recording: (4366/ 9621) 
 Took my key and- 

Recording: (4367/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4368/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4369/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (4370/ 9621) 
 That's right. That's right. It's a parakeet. 

Recording: (4371/ 9621) 
 in I think, probably 84. 

Recording: (4372/ 9621) 
 I grew up in, is this registering? It slipped. 

Recording: (4373/ 9621) 
 That's the Appalachian area. It'd be great if somebody, you know, they'd want to pump all this money into it, but unfortunately, whenever the government pumps money into an area, you know, that tends to be like a foreign country gets it, you know, 

Recording: (4374/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I figure right now I might as well take advantage of it. 

Recording: (4375/ 9621) 
 I would say it doesn't really matter either way honestly. I mean the fact of the matter is they are so deal with it. I mean get over it. I mean 

Recording: (4376/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4377/ 9621) 
 Yeah, teach one person one thing and not teach the other person that. And they said that these teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation because of their actual sitting down and hands-on critiquing these children. Like, uh, ex-girlfriend of mine, she was pretty much, I wouldn't put her borderline illiterate, but she didn't know how to read or write. 

Recording: (4378/ 9621) 
 I could. It might take me a year or two.

 Mm-hmm.

 And Teresa, the founder, also realizes that if you can break that cycle through the children, so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children. 

Recording: (4385/ 9621) 
 Something to think about. 

Recording: (4386/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. What I can't understand is some people live in Upper Arlington and they send their kids to private school. 

Recording: (4387/ 9621) 
 Not for long. 

Recording: (4388/ 9621) 
 And that's what we did. And so he's just like my own too now. I go and volunteer. He's in kindergarten. I go and volunteer in his classroom too. So it's kind of like, I hope I get to do this forever.

 Pretty much lived here my whole life. I was born in Sunbury, raised in Gehenna, and I was in the service for four years. So I actually came back here in 1972, and I've been here since then. I was born in 1950, August 25th. I'm divorced. I have a daughter, B19, this year. And they live in St. Louis.

 And

 A nurse practitioner has more authority, I guess, to diagnose and see patients. The state of Ohio is, I think, the only state that has a given nurse practitioner's prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions. So we can see patients, do the physicals. We can suggest medications, I guess, per se, but then the physician has to come in, confirm our findings, and then he actually writes the prescriptions. 

Recording: (4399/ 9621) 
 Heh. 

Recording: (4400/ 9621) 
 So that broke that up and he still messed around her and then he was dating another girl and I like told on him and that made him not like me for a while.

 You better call the North Shop. 

Recording: (4402/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I do. And if I read it every day, I try to. And I go to church. I have all sorts of activities I do. And I'm just always feeling like I'm reinforced, that it's not just some sort of flaky idea, that it's, for me, that it's real. And it just always makes sense. That's important to me, that I feel like it makes sense. 

Recording: (4403/ 9621) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (4404/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's kind of subjective, although there is a paper that we hand out to our kids that tells exactly what's supposed to be in every part of this essay. Like the first, the introductory paragraph is supposed to consist of a way to capture the reader's attention. It's supposed to supply background information. It's supposed to state your thesis statement, which tells mainly what the paper's going to be about. And then you're supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas about your thesis that you're going to develop in paragraphs two, three, and four. 

Recording: (4405/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4406/ 9621) 
 And he knew it was a bullshit war.

 Okay. I have two students. Well, one is a student here currently. 

Recording: (4408/ 9621) 
 No, I think I thrive on stress. I think it keeps me going or something. But I do have to do something that is accomplishing something. I don't want to sit in an office, I've already done that, day in and day out working for other people that I don't even approve of, that are making way too much money anyway, you know, and half the

Recording: (4411/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

 and i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it was pretty old and they were just things that he'd do and i guess just picking up watching him seeing what he would do 

Recording: (4413/ 9621) 
 That's just like I told them, take everything you got that your real father got you. 

Recording: (4414/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4415/ 9621) 
 I had psychology class. I had one. That counts for anything. So I know a little bit about studies. 

Recording: (4416/ 9621) 
 Yeah. And it's just, it's moving there, the whole, you know, strip malls. And I was in, I spent my first Christmas there in Belgium with a friend. And I mean, we would drive by and she'd be like, oh, this is because of, you know, your country, these people are moving in and buying whatever. And so conversely, I see it moving in the other direction, unfortunately, rather than. 

Recording: (4417/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4418/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they really like it. They have a huge house in the middle of nowhere out on a farm. And my brother-in-law bought his father's Wendy's businesses out. And so they own like six Wendy's out there. But it's out in the middle of nowhere. That was the whole problem. He tried to get him to move and tried to get him to do this years and years ago. And nobody wanted to move to Nebraska. He was doing them from Ohio, which is really tough, running five Wendy's in Nebraska and commuting. So he was either driving or flying a lot. 

Recording: (4419/ 9621) 
 And I've always felt good about it, but people always said, oh, you don't even crave a Wendy's hamburger and all this stuff. And once you make a decision like that, you don't crave things like that. You don't even think about it. 

Recording: (4420/ 9621) 
 Great. Where are you from? 

Recording: (4421/ 9621) 
 well the PSATs and the you know just all those centralized scoring systems they have they they pretty much told me that you know my scores when I was in what was it fifth grade yeah fifth grade they said that I was I had a high IQ and I could be doctor lawyer yada yada yada I don't 

Recording: (4422/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't. Well, that's fair. Maybe that's true, too. I mean, I don't feel because, you know, when you're younger, you think, oh, my God, 27, that's so old. You must be, you know, and now that you're here, you're like, I feel fine. I don't feel like a little more responsible. But other than that.

 Yeah, that was after I got kicked out and I just decided I'll go to work for a couple months. Make something out of it. I learned to trade.

 He was pretty much promised a free ride through OSU's music program. And he's thrown that away. And I don't even know if he regrets that. I really have no idea. He just doesn't want to talk to us about things like that. He does talk to his girlfriend about it. And she's become very close with my wife. She's never had an adult. Really did. A mentor of any kind even. My wife, she wants to go to school. My wife's agreed to go with her when she goes for the interviews and stuff. She says she doesn't know what to ask or anything.

 His speed was like, say, 70 mile an hour before, and now it's going to be 20 because he doesn't know how to do it. And that's the problem they're running into. They have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in trail and everything. But now they've got to do this extra part, which is going to make their job easier down the road. But everybody hates change. So what they're doing now is they're having problems because people can't take the volume of airplanes because they're trying to keep up with the computer, so it's making it even slower yet. But once they get in the swing of things, it'll be okay. But you're talking a while, because it's not something that you can do overnight. It'd be like your dad learning the computer. He's not going to do it overnight.

 And apparently when you're a car, they have a very, very zero tolerance.

 They've been just troubled kids in the past I have

 not only with us the children but just to other people also. You know how mother used to feed the bums that would come at the front door and she'd fix them food and so she was a very

 again with the news reports with the different bombings and I think the Jewish school caught my attention and now that he is in daycare, I mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always kind of wonder what's going on. He's done quite well, he's learned how to use scissors, how to color, he's socially learning how to play with other kids, those were all things he wasn't doing at home. Potty training's been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and

 expanded bus service. 

Recording: (4448/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. Well, speaking of acoustics, I don't know if I'm, you have to tell me if I'm going off the subject, or you know, if you'd need to ask me something else. Okay. This is another interesting story. My church choir is a very important part of the church up there. Have you ever been to the church up there? You should visit sometime, although you're only going to be here for another month. The summer is not necessarily the best time to visit. 

Recording: (4449/ 9621) 
 and I'm hoping to get, I'm gonna get a puppy and a kitten together. 

Recording: (4450/ 9621) 
 if they're, especially if they're over 40, because their company's giving money back to the community for this and that. And, you know, that's how they're trying to show that they care about this. They're trying to mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the downtrodden or, you know. But you're right, I think it's terrible that every other country in the world has higher math skills than we do, better science skills than we do, better language skills than we do. Why, Canadians even go to school for 13 years, not 12, you know. And I just think that this proficiency thing is finally going to make people accountable. 

Recording: (4451/ 9621) 
 anyway. And I'm not saying in general, but with the experiences that I've had, certain families where they don't, socioeconomically, just not as well off. 

Recording: (4452/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4453/ 9621) 
 Yeah, quite a bit. Yeah, I've seen Columbus grow from the time I've lived here as a child. 161, Dublin-Granville Road. I can remember when that was all country. 

Recording: (4454/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but you just have to have something to go by and this is a close thing and we have to just go with it, you know, I mean you can't go back and try to read. I don't know, somebody was trying to rearrange the calendar one time, weren't they?

 Oh, okay.

 And I was 39. 

Recording: (4460/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4461/ 9621) 
 I really am not educated into that at all, so I wouldn't probably say anything since I'm ignorant in the field. 

Recording: (4462/ 9621) 
 Oh no, we just had a whole conversation, come on now. 

Recording: (4463/ 9621) 
 We don't really have that much. The foreign ones, it's probably like maybe 2 or 3% of our total pilots.

 Well, his two main characters in his cartoons were Willie and Joe. 

Recording: (4465/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I think she really kind of knows that from conversations with me and stuff while she was growing up. My values and stuff basically are more religious oriented than I would say my wife's. So I think she knows what I value as being important, what I value as being not important. But on the rest of the question, I'd love to have been able to have been there every other weekend. Sounds good, you know, as far as... 

Recording: (4466/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4467/ 9621) 
 And that's when I said no.

 Oh yeah, Adriaticos. 

Recording: (4470/ 9621) 
 Right.

 And so I got to be the first graduating class of this brand new school that they built because the old one had just overflowed beyond all recognition. 

Recording: (4472/ 9621) 
 I can't say that really bothered me too much. I mean it's the same thing as having a woman gym teacher or whatever 

Recording: (4473/ 9621) 
 I was in 78. And then I've just, I have stayed there and it's grown a lot and the work changes. It's an interesting place to work because, well first the job is almost a different job every year because so many changes are happening. We're trying to stay out in front of what, in front of what library innovations, in front of web and net innovations and try to incorporate it all. So it's kind of exciting because you're getting in on things that are really new and trying to master it. The project I'm working on now is trying to find a way to create data that describes web resources so that libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with their regular collection. And we're doing a lot of it with it. Yeah, it is. It's a pretty neat project. A lot of new things. Java and the web give us opportunities to do things that we've talked about before but couldn't really do very well. So it's pretty neat. 

Recording: (4474/ 9621) 
 for people to read. I think there's enough other resources out there if somebody's interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that. I know for me, just because I have so many younger brothers and sisters and my family and everything, I know how, I've got some, some, some pretty, what I feel are pretty good opinions about how to handle different things. And I know that my mom always consults me, you know, like my sister, you know, she got her a D in French, which Vanessa is just, she's, this girl's almost creepy. She's so bright. I mean, she really is. I mean, it's one of those things where she just doesn't turn in her stuff, you know, and she's 12. 

Recording: (4475/ 9621) 
 Just a teeny bit. 

Recording: (4476/ 9621) 
 We're all in Columbus.

 That's why I started at the 

Recording: (4478/ 9621) 
 It was so amazing to be back in America. 

Recording: (4479/ 9621) 
 No. No. I was born in New York. I wasn't playing. I then went to Tennessee with my family and that was after I was six months old. 

Recording: (4480/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4481/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4482/ 9621) 
 He seems pretty arrogant. I don't think he's done really too much for Columbus. They need to get a younger coach. They need a new. 

Recording: (4483/ 9621) 
 Right, the competition aspect. 

Recording: (4484/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (4485/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4486/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well like, um... 

Recording: (4487/ 9621) 
 Because we want to be, because it's a privilege. Not because, oh my god, I gotta go to another play. You know, my daughter just did a play downtown with Columbus Junior Theater, and I ushered at 18 performances because I could see it free. I didn't want to pay 10 bucks every time to see it, but if I ushered, I could be in the audience every time. You know, and for my parents to have no interest in seeing, seeing play baseball or swims for Ohio Wesleyan, you know, or in a play. They don't even want to be bothered with that. That's just to them. And I can't understand that. 

Recording: (4488/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so that's pretty much what she likes to do. 

Recording: (4489/ 9621) 
 A year later, uh-huh.

 you 

Recording: (4491/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (4492/ 9621) 
 true communism, not as it was practiced in Russia but where people share and share power and share money and equally. But where we are in our evolution, we're not ready for it. Actually, when I was in Oregon, I did a lot of experimenting and I lived in an intentional community which was actually trying 

Recording: (4493/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4494/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4495/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (4496/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4497/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (4498/ 9621) 
 So, because he and I always discussed politics and stuff. 

Recording: (4499/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4500/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4501/ 9621) 
 There generally tends to be at least one or two Republicans I vote for each election. Sometimes I voted straight Democrat because I just, you know, I even voted for Dorothy Teeter the first time she ran for county commissioner because I liked her style and I thought she was nice and I liked what she was saying. But then her votes later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so I didn't vote for her after that. But the first time she ran for county commissioner I did it one because she was a woman and I like, you know, when possible I like to vote for women. 

Recording: (4502/ 9621) 
 And I had two little girls and I thought, wait a minute, you know, I, my whole life changed because my commitment was to them and to, you know, get all the opportunities that were out there for them. And, and it just didn't happen that, you know, that we both had the same, he wanted everything to be the same, you know? So I think that really changed everything. It does, your whole focus changes because everything you say, somebody's listening and everything you want to do, somebody's watching. 

Recording: (4503/ 9621) 
 You're coming with me. 

Recording: (4504/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, you get these, you probably heard on the news, these 15 murders or so since 1991 on the East Side. And then you got all these people, you know, I've been in the fights in my neighborhood, well, my old neighborhood, and you know, fights, people breaking in, stealing your stuff, and just all out outlandish behavior. I mean I caught I actually rode up on a couple people down the street from me having sex through a fence. 

Recording: (4505/ 9621) 
 I'm so much more relaxed. I mean, the pressures that these kids these days have on them. And you're right, without families at home to give them the guidance. I mean, at Columbine, if I'm not mistaking, that was the one who had the journal, who had, somebody had made bombs in the garage and the family didn't know about it. And I was like, how can a family not know that? But if they're so busy and working and trying to provide, sure. 

Recording: (4506/ 9621) 
 and then attending grad school.

 We're excited. It'll be fun. 

Recording: (4509/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4510/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're just so 

Recording: (4511/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because they go back in three days. 

Recording: (4512/ 9621) 
 I'm a big family. Yeah, well, as I mentioned a while ago, I happen to have to laugh out loud. And he said, what's so funny? Of all the names I'm looking for from all my family, he's finding things for his family. I said, you know what I found one of them? Way back in what was it, 1670 or something, this boatload of people come over from England, and they were the ones that had been deported from England because they had done something against the government or something like, you know, stolen or were the thief or something. And I said, would you read the only person I can find on my family is nothing but a convict you know you even got deported from the country I don't know why he was there and that's a ship he was on 

Recording: (4513/ 9621) 
 took me like

 425. 

Recording: (4515/ 9621) 
 I think, if you had to ask, I'd say I was a straight Midwestern suburbanite, but there are people that I go to school with, and Ashland is 25,000, like in the city. 

Recording: (4516/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (4517/ 9621) 
 It doesn't have to cost anything, but you can go do it with your family or whatever. 

Recording: (4518/ 9621) 
 scoreboard they're always stopping something and they don't seem to move forward very well 

Recording: (4519/ 9621) 
 No, I don't either because I believe in the death penalty and I feel taking a life like that, leaving someone there just to die. 

Recording: (4520/ 9621) 
 since she went back to them. 

Recording: (4521/ 9621) 
 That'd be $200 a month. 

Recording: (4522/ 9621) 
 they really have no self-worth. Because, you know, I know a long time ago we went to a, what was it, it's like a seminar for the Ivy League schools, which I looked at their tuition and went, you know, there was no way, but, and I thought this is so stupid to be here. But I listened to the man, there was like four or five men talking and some women talking, whatever, and they said, you know, if your child makes straight A's and applies at our school, we don't want them. And I'm like, what? He says, we look at two children sitting side by side. This one's making straight A's. This one's sort of made B's. But this one over here got into track when he or she was in freshman, and noticed every track meet they basically were like last or second to last but they did it for four years.

Recording: (4524/ 9621) 
 You know, stuff like that's always been around, but it seems now that the guns are more... You can get them easier. Well, it's like me, I could be carrying a gun right now. What are they going to do to me?

 So yeah, I think as a whole we've all kind of gone our separate ways, which is scary. I mean, we don't have the same belief system in anything anymore, so it's kind of like, oh, geez. 

Recording: (4527/ 9621) 
 if they 

Recording: (4528/ 9621) 
 and the safety of the neighborhood. And there are a few things, really, that go into it. 

Recording: (4529/ 9621) 
 Did you really? 

Recording: (4530/ 9621) 
 around more than somebody else. 

Recording: (4531/ 9621) 
 Now I think that those four kids, at least among my grandchildren, are getting pretty much at the same training that I did, or maybe better than I got. My oldest son's two daughters are, well, they're good kids and they're smart kids, but I don't think that they have the moral grounding that Greg and Beth's kids do. You said this is all confidential. 

Recording: (4532/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (4533/ 9621) 
 and move on. That's basically my fear. But as one of the guys tried to help me, he said, well, listen, I'm afraid of that too. He said, because right there in that pit there, that's God. Now, if you remember that, there's nothing in here that can hurt you, even as hot as it gets. And when you think about that, you try not to think too much while you're in there. Although it's hard to do, especially if you're thinking about how hot it is. But if you're listening to people praying, and they're praying with their heart, and I tell you, because of how hot it gets in there, you'll hear people pray straight from their heart. Not a bunch of real fancy words, in a real comfortable setting, you know, that heat 

Recording: (4534/ 9621) 
 UGH! HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEhehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe 

Recording: (4535/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4536/ 9621) 
 Birmingham, Alabama. 

Recording: (4537/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is, it is. And there's nothing to guarantee that I wouldn't have the same result. Which isn't to say that someday I won't get back into teaching, but I might. 

Recording: (4538/ 9621) 
 Oh, that's why. Okay. 

Recording: (4539/ 9621) 
 Right in there, yeah. And I had friends that lived in Buckhead. 

Recording: (4540/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4541/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (4542/ 9621) 
 No, I never did. I don't know many people that do, but it was also, for me, I think if I know something's true, I just know it, and then as long as it keeps on being true over and over again, if it's not just some exciting thing that for one day it's like, oh, this is great, but like six months later it still has the same, still ringing true, and a year later, two years later, then that's how I feel. 

Recording: (4543/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4544/ 9621) 
 I just think it's a horribly biased paper. They don't really take their journalistic unbiased integrity, they don't take that seriously. 

Recording: (4545/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (4546/ 9621) 
 I mean, yes, some people. 

Recording: (4547/ 9621) 
 I had hypertension when I had the first two and then the last two I had, now I got cardiovascular disease. I still got one of my arteries about 80% blocked. I got another one 50% blocked. I got a dead spot on my heart right now. So when I exercise, my heart slows down. Let's put it this way, where I work at, I work here at OSU. 

Recording: (4548/ 9621) 
 My sister was here only. 

Recording: (4549/ 9621) 
 that I finally just said, OK, we're going to start training people to make money with computers. 

Recording: (4550/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4551/ 9621) 
 So it was hard to talk to drunk people. 

Recording: (4552/ 9621) 
 We just agreed to get divorced. I didn't even see the lawyer. He just brought the papers for me to sign. 

Recording: (4553/ 9621) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (4554/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (4555/ 9621) 
 So he was strictly a union man. He believed in the unions. So the railroad was union. 

Recording: (4556/ 9621) 
 Well it probably would have been, yeah, but they felt that I would change and I've also been a vegetarian for 22 years and when I first decided to do that everyone said, oh you'll change, wait till you get married, you'll, you know, and I don't eat any animals at all and it was just a conscious decision. 

Recording: (4557/ 9621) 
 I think it was the east side, I think. It was a while ago. He hasn't been there for a while. 

Recording: (4558/ 9621) 
 Hehe. 

Recording: (4559/ 9621) 
 You don't tell me what to do. I said, well, OK, you want to call me back? Well, people like it or something like that. I think she called me, ended up calling me back a couple, three hours later. And I was pissed, so I wouldn't talk to her. Little childish things. I'll pay you back. 

Recording: (4560/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Don't bother me one bit. 

Recording: (4561/ 9621) 
 I had fun, I enjoyed it. It's one of my favorite classes actually, for an elective. 

Recording: (4562/ 9621) 
 I'm like, you know, what hospital is that? You know, what jury? You know? So a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multimillion dollar lawsuits are, is a lie. Even the lady that, I mean, sued McDonald's for spilling the coffee on herself because she put it in her crotch with the lid off, you know. There a common sense clause in lawsuits, her own stupidity. And then you get the attorneys trying to argue that well, McDonald's coffee is hotter than every other coffee. 

Recording: (4563/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he lives with me and I mean that's my engagement ring. 

Recording: (4564/ 9621) 
 Oof. 

Recording: (4565/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4566/ 9621) 
 No, no, no. 

Recording: (4567/ 9621) 
 No, well, one place is here and one place is right across the street from it, so I got two to choose from. Just a road over from me. 

Recording: (4568/ 9621) 
 Yeah, pretty interesting. Everybody talks and frequently nobody's listening. And yeah, it's pretty interesting. Talking about how they don't have the money for this and they don't have the money for that and then somebody comes up with, well, let's spend the money over on something else and nobody acts on it and then they go on to something else. 

Recording: (4569/ 9621) 
 High school, marijuana, acid, mushrooms. 

Recording: (4570/ 9621) 
 Really. 

Recording: (4571/ 9621) 
 Because see, I'm his stepfather. 

Recording: (4572/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4573/ 9621) 
 If they didn't give him what he wanted, I was like, whoa. And it was like, oh, we could get paid. I was like, no. 

Recording: (4574/ 9621) 
 off the thing a little bit. Cause that'll be fun. 

Recording: (4575/ 9621) 
 Not much. 

Recording: (4576/ 9621) 
 When we were in North Africa, there was one German gun that was firing on us and they couldn't figure where he was. 

Recording: (4577/ 9621) 
 You mean at OSU? 

Recording: (4578/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (4579/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4580/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think so. Met quite a few people from Cleveland, and then my roommates from North Canton. 

Recording: (4581/ 9621) 
 mother used to be a principal of mine in elementary school so uh... he's like i think we should talk okay great kisses like a boy you're way too serious for this particular okay that's fine we knew ahead of time that this was all coming to an end don't worry about it so i i uh... at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for i don't know where that is i never found it never saw it never it's anyway not relevant relevant in all the story But it bugs me every time I told the story cuz doesn't exist Anyway, so then we come back inside and he's like, well, I've got some bad news and my sister's like what? Okay, go ahead and he's like no, I think you should sit down. I'm like, all right 

Recording: (4582/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4583/ 9621) 
 We have a... yeah, we have. 

Recording: (4584/ 9621) 
 The herbs. The herbs. 

Recording: (4585/ 9621) 
 I used to when I was driving now, especially when I was going through the, going to 270 things, you know, I had people flip me off and stuff like that. And the funny thing, one time a guy flipped me off because he was going slow and I got all pissed off about it and went around him and everything, you know. And I go to work pulling an action chemical and he pulls in beside me but him. I look over at him, he looks at me like, oh, I'm sorry, I mean, you know, 

Recording: (4586/ 9621) 
 It's supposed to be an alternative type to the public schools where they can hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 

Recording: (4587/ 9621) 
 I think more what they need to do is instruct or just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that. Because I mean for the most part, I mean people really don't get too badly punished for things. I mean if you look in other countries, I mean like people in like the Asian countries, places like that, I mean they they have really strict laws. I mean, if you even get caught for like vandalism, you're still serving jail time and you get pretty badly punished for it. I mean, in some cases, they'll even chain you up and beat you in public for it. And I think, not to sound too vengeful, but I think if more things went that way, that there would be a much less problem with it. I think just the fact that the jails are so overcrowded now that they know that they're gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff, that if you shoot someone, you're not even gonna get 30 days in jail and you're gonna be let go. I mean, that's an awfully small price to pay for 

Recording: (4588/ 9621) 
 I'm just more of a conservative person. I mean, I'm not sure exactly what his platform is, but I've seen him speak a couple times and I don't know, he just impresses me more than Al Gore. 

Recording: (4589/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (4590/ 9621) 
 Well, it was rough. 

Recording: (4591/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4592/ 9621) 
 That's probably what I'll do, ignore it until like August or July and then start paying attention. 

Recording: (4593/ 9621) 
 I mean, there's always been the nerds and I don't know, when I was growing up in the 70s, there really wasn't punk or anything like that. And I think, unfortunately, I mean, there's always going to be all different kinds of people to make the world, but they've just pushed it to an extreme, certain kinds of kids. And, you know, they want to, I saw, you know, I I watch all these shows Dateline in 2020 and all this informative shows and how one was in Texas run over one of the punk kids was run over by a jock 

Recording: (4594/ 9621) 
 and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage. So that's where they met. So what was it like coming to Columbus? Have you been here a lot? No, uh-uh. I come down here two or three times, just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things. But when I moved to the city, it was a real big change because I used to live in the country. And then I move into smack dab in the middle of a downtown area. 

Recording: (4595/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4596/ 9621) 
 What I'm saying is... 

Recording: (4597/ 9621) 
 It is, that's weird. 

Recording: (4598/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (4599/ 9621) 
 Well, I mean, to me, the whole thing is wrong, regardless of if you're guilty or innocent. To me, there's worse things, I would think, than dying. I know in Israel, the guy who killed Yitzhak Rabin, he got locked up, and he's not allowed to see it because under Jewish law, you can't kill. 

Recording: (4600/ 9621) 
 and I have a wife, been married 13 years, have two kids age 5 and 7. Both of them, one's in second grade and the other one's still in daycare at Ohio State University. 

Recording: (4601/ 9621) 
 Right. And if he's open-minded enough to do it, eventually he'll see the light and say, well, this will make it a lot easier. But there are people who are like, I will not do this. You know, so those are the ones that have to be drug, screaming and kicking. 

Recording: (4602/ 9621) 
 It's saltwater fish. 

Recording: (4603/ 9621) 
 I mean, at that point, I certainly didn't have any real knowledge about any of that sort of thing. They covered the basics. They did talk about condoms and contraception. I remember we watched a film, which everyone was very embarrassed by. I mean, I don't really, they did send home a packet to the parents because I remember being really upset and not wanting my mom to talk with me about it. 

Recording: (4604/ 9621) 
 Yeah, the procreation part of what marriage is all about. But I see marriage as more than just propagating. 

Recording: (4605/ 9621) 
 She ran a forklift into a pole and busted her nose and chipped her tooth. She's a dangerous woman. She gets a lot of tickets sometimes when she's not running into poles. We'll use them because they normally go to the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home. We do that a lot too. 

Recording: (4606/ 9621) 
 you know, the same thing you were talking about. And we were only the third people to live in it. And so it needed everything, you know, and it had gold carpet. Now gold's back, but in those days everything was like gold and, you know, and green. It was horrible. And it was great fun. We had a lot of fun. We took the back porch and made it part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on, finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom. We put an in-ground pool. And so I always joke because what I paid for it, I now owe three times that amount on it. 

Recording: (4607/ 9621) 
 And the stern expression or the expression on that face can be equally effective as the smack on the bottom with a bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be. I know the most effective penalty for me was my mother would go out near a tree and she would break a twig off and she would smack me across the shoulder. And yeah, it left marks, but sure, it hurt. I mean, it would sting. And I understood exactly what was meant. I think I grew up and I ended up being, I think, a quite successful person. I think my mother had 13 of the 15 children who lived, all pretty doggone decent kids. And none of us were injured, none of us were hurt, and that was a basic method of penalty. It wasn't something that truly hurt, injured. Now today, however, I suspect my mom could easily be, could have been charged with abuse, child abuse, because it left a mark across my shoulder where that green switch, it was always a green switch because the old ones, they would break. You didn't want them to break. 

Recording: (4608/ 9621) 
 I tend to fear that. 

Recording: (4609/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with him. Because when I get home with him, I sit down and do his ABCs, one, two, threes. But he loves to read books, so I try to get her to do that instead of just let them play all day. 

Recording: (4610/ 9621) 
 I'd like to be, you know, but she lives, I keep telling her, I wish you'd move down here, but I'm not moving to Toledo. I don't like Toledo. 

Recording: (4611/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right. 

Recording: (4612/ 9621) 
 I'm just an operator right now. I've done production work too for them. 

Recording: (4613/ 9621) 
 I mean they didn't really do anything too extensive on it that they basically as far as religion classes go they basically told what the Catholic Church believed about it and How they felt about it, but I mean they didn't really condemn or Support it or anything like that. I mean they they basically did realize that it's more up to the person I mean 

Recording: (4614/ 9621) 
 interactive they are. 

Recording: (4615/ 9621) 
 Well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it's been a while from there so that's not something that right now I've had anything like that. 

Recording: (4616/ 9621) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (4617/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, but but but many people Especially the kid that young May not know what that really means and may is to be part of the group and part of it You know be cool may go along with it when really they don't like it I don't I haven't made up my mind about him whether he's telling the truth or whether he hasn't or whether he wasn't 

Recording: (4618/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it got boring, it got frustrating because we get these new people moving in and you're used to everything being nice, you know, and then you get people next door breaking into you or upstairs from you breaking into you. 

Recording: (4619/ 9621) 
 Oh my. 

Recording: (4620/ 9621) 
 We want a dog and we've kind of been waiting. But I like both animals. 

Recording: (4621/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4622/ 9621) 
 Oh, that's right. 

Recording: (4623/ 9621) 
 Oh no! 

Recording: (4624/ 9621) 
 Mhm, sure 

Recording: (4625/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4626/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (4627/ 9621) 
 Yeah, or yeah, you know, it's a tough one, you know, you got kids that are doing softball soccer, you know all these events and you know, like on Thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at 830 and she usually Drives from work to the softball and after that she home by 9 So she's like I can see how you fall into this drive-thru window business, you know, no, but luckily, you so that helps a lot. I can get them home. I can feed them, and I can get them. So that's how our life is, Mr. Mom. 

Recording: (4628/ 9621) 
 Well, I was with Mormons, so we, I don't know if you've ever seen how they go two by two always, and I was with what we call another sister, and we would live in an apartment and we would pay for our own mission, and there was a mission president and they had different people with responsibilities, leaders, and they would watch over you and make sure, you know, call every night and check on you. But it was really up to us what we wanted to do. We'd get up, leave at 930, be home by 930 or whenever it got dark. 

Recording: (4629/ 9621) 
 That was pretty good. Never had to borrow any money. Never went on welfare. Didn't. I think I was on food stamps or something for a month. 

Recording: (4630/ 9621) 
 I forget the name, well I don't think there's a university at Portland, but there's two, two, oh yes, there is a university. I can't think of which one it is right now. Speaking of opinions, did you see the paper today about the thing in Seattle, they're having this big, they're having fights and 

Recording: (4631/ 9621) 
 And then I was in Tennessee for, I don't know, a year. 

Recording: (4632/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4633/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4634/ 9621) 
 It's story elements. 

Recording: (4635/ 9621) 
 There's a huge wind tunnel, yeah. 

Recording: (4636/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4637/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (4638/ 9621) 
 But the federal government and their lawyers have done that. And the Department of the Interior still considers Native Americans on the same level as a dog. They don't have rights. There's something wrong there. And that still goes on today after about 600 years. And we got good people in this country that want to do something about it. But unfortunately, what I'm finding, everybody's got to choose their path. 

Recording: (4639/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (4640/ 9621) 
 I'm going to go and pee in the... 

Recording: (4641/ 9621) 
 Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

Recording: (4642/ 9621) 
 way in the future. 

Recording: (4643/ 9621) 
 Do you really? 

Recording: (4644/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't know if you remember, you might not be quite old enough, but you may know this song, Sinead O'Connor, nothing compares to you. When 

Recording: (4645/ 9621) 
 I won't lie there, a lot of happy strippers in town. Or I should say exotic dancers. 

Recording: (4646/ 9621) 
 very big. I mean probably down the line because like we're still struggling to get up you know. We're waiting for that million dollar check that's 

Recording: (4647/ 9621) 
 So now he's back in the lawn care until something else better comes along. 

Recording: (4648/ 9621) 
 And I know it sounds crazy, but I'd rather have 10 animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals than children. I don't know why. I knew at a very young age that it just wasn't important to me. It wouldn't be a part of my life. 

Recording: (4649/ 9621) 
 I know another thing about the kids nowadays is, and Devin, I experienced it with her, you know, I sent her $100 one time, you know, just for her, and she sat there and said, I called her up a couple days later, or about a week later or something like that, and said, what'd you do with that, what'd you get with that money and everything? She goes, well, you know, I bought a Gap t-shirt and a CD, and I said, mm-hmm. She goes, what do you mean, that's what I bought? And I said, you bought a CD and you bought a blouse? 

Recording: (4650/ 9621) 
 That's a real major question, isn't it? No, I don't think it's too bad. I mean, well, we could go into the issue of the Columbus Board of Education. What's his name? He is always... 

Recording: (4651/ 9621) 
 And they had a strong public support over there. It's a really tight-knit community. It's quite different. Columbus needs to learn a lot from that area. And it's a matter of just putting, I guess, your hands in the—practicing your faith, which we 

Recording: (4652/ 9621) 
 open to that tunnel and they fired a couple of our shells into the tunnel and then took off. 

Recording: (4653/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4654/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4655/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (4656/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4657/ 9621) 
 Yeah. So you know his friend lives on the other side you know it's like a duplex and his friend lived on the other side and he he also was broken into but they came through his bathroom window. 

Recording: (4658/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4659/ 9621) 
 And that's so sad for our city. 

Recording: (4660/ 9621) 
 Um, so they're coming up and there's been like divorce papers and stuff on it. And I know that police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents. I don't personally think that divorce documents are that important, but nothing's beyond the realm of possibility for people to take things way out, way too seriously. Yes. 

Recording: (4661/ 9621) 
 Well, see, we have real traditional breakdown of chores, but only because that's just happened to be what we like, the way we like it. Do you know what I mean? And it's not because, you know, I consider my whole household a lot of feminists. You know, we're all real strong about that. But the thing is, since I have the luxury of being at home and Peter is doing a job that he really enjoys and I am doing something I enjoy, I really am happy to do all of those things that typically women do because that's my job, that's my trade off. I don't have to go someplace else. I can go and have coffee every day with my daughters. I can go and do whatever I want and I'm happy to do these other things. 

Recording: (4662/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4663/ 9621) 
 I think that step would be really fun. I've never done it, but it always looks like so much fun to me. 

Recording: (4664/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. Medicaid, I think. I think.

 every day. The other one I don't see that much anymore.

 Oh.

 Yeah, I contributed to too many people. There's too many people. There's not enough commitment. It's too easy to get divorced. And the competition, I mean, there's just tons and tons of just people everywhere. And young people today, I don't know what the statistics are going to be, but I don't think they have a good idea of what marriage even is. Also before marriage was a commitment to a type of lifestyle, and that lifestyle is gone. Everybody is independent, everybody is going their own ways, and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that is looking in the same direction you are and is equally as independent, then it might. But who knows why each person gets divorced. I mean each one of them was an individual situation. 

Recording: (4670/ 9621) 
 Oh, that's great. 

Recording: (4671/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (4672/ 9621) 
 Just kind of instincts, I guess. Yeah, actually there are quite a, there's a pretty well-known doctor that has a ton of books and I go to La Leche League and that's kind of their philosophy in a way. Yeah. Just that breastfeeding is, you know, a way to mother and nurture and feed and you know, it meets all of often. Their IQs are higher. And it's just amazing to me that she actually read a study that they did from breastfed babies to bottle fed babies and they said the difference in their IQ is equivalent to a regular bottle fed baby and a baby exposed to lead poisoning It's that much higher even so I mean it's just given them that much of a better head start on development so. 

Recording: (4673/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but some names are just like, we had a friend once, she got pregnant like after her two boys were almost grown up and they didn't ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy. So she named the little girl after her mother and the mother's name was Harriet.

 So I, you know, they probably all, hey, you resemble that remark, or you know. 

Recording: (4677/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (4678/ 9621) 
 Where are you from? 

Recording: (4679/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (4680/ 9621) 
 Well, I think all through growing up there's always been, you know, different kind of kids. 

Recording: (4681/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (4682/ 9621) 
 Where is he from? Way up north. And where is your mom from? So did first met and my dad was extremely taken with her.

 Do you have a three o'clock?

 No, I had a cat that just died.

 Oh yeah, there's got to be unconditional love out there. 

Recording: (4686/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they do. I thought it was really cool. We went hiking in the Alps and somebody told us that, um... 

Recording: (4687/ 9621) 
 for that, so he got locked up and he's not allowed to see another human being. 

Recording: (4688/ 9621) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (4689/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (4690/ 9621) 
 It has a lot to do with the fact that the church

Recording: (4693/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (4694/ 9621) 
 I think that's kind of where I'm coming from, Jan. And I know you, Jan, I mean, what my sister does, I just say to her, I just really admire it. I can't give as much as she gives. I just don't have that same spirit she has. But it's great to see. I mean, she's real. She really, when she is with the people, I don't know, I have this thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and you can lead a better life but Janet just envelops them with her kindness and probably has less expectations from the people she works with. 

Recording: (4695/ 9621) 
 Oh, I would be surprised. 

Recording: (4696/ 9621) 
 Time to go. All right, I'm done here. 

Recording: (4697/ 9621) 
 I don't think so now with the diversity that we have here. 

Recording: (4698/ 9621) 
 Get back to God. Get back to believing in God and the values that the family should have. I don't know. How's that connected? Well, God didn't teach you to go out and shoot your neighbor, and he didn't go out and tell you to steal from him, and he didn't tell you to ignore him the rest of your life. He didn't tell you that they're down there bleeding to death. Oh, walk and turn the other way. I mean, he taught you to help and be loving toward each other. And it's lacking in a lot people today as I said that that's that old me me me me thing or Iii or however you want to say I Really think that that's most of it And I don't know how people I got a letter the other day And I can't remember the name of the personality that was doing it be sending out these things about how you can sign up to take him right in and say don't have these kind of TV programs on anymore. Where they use a profanity, where they use the drinking, where they use a dope, and where they use the vulgarity. And I understand this thing about him being a her and her being a him. What is, what is, what word am I looking for right now that I've lost?

 College-wise I don't know anyone of college age that's gay

 and come back in. 

Recording: (4710/ 9621) 
 A little bit north of North Broadway, right along the freeway there. Didn't used to be a bad neighborhood, but now it's just kinda, you got the little kids growing up and doing shit that, you know, you picture yourself doing as a child one way or another, you know. Now you throw rocks around and stuff, and accidentally break a window, run away. 

Recording: (4711/ 9621) 
 That's true. Sometimes we have trouble finding enough violists or something, you know, an instrument like that. But they usually get enough to play a concert. Sometimes we have to bring in a couple of instrumentalists for last few rehearsals. So we sort of have stringers, I guess you'd call them. Yeah, we've actually been on WSU also, radio on music in mid Ohio. Our recording last year? Yeah, of Beethoven's Ninth got on music in mid Ohio. Yeah, we used the Otterbein College Choir. 

Recording: (4712/ 9621) 
 Well, I would sit down and talk to her. Like, you know, if you want to have sex, if you really want to have sex, you should get on some kind of birth control. 

Recording: (4713/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, I played music and stuff with a lot of my friends. I don't know, basically just standard teenage stuff, sitting around watching TV and, I don't know, just running around or whatever. But in high school, it was always just real like you put in a tiny little bit of effort and you get a B, and that's good enough, I guess. 

Recording: (4714/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4715/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

Recording: (4718/ 9621) 
 No, yeah, I guess it's you. 

Recording: (4719/ 9621) 
 during school but at the same time I mean as long as the parents love the kids it doesn't really matter what sex they are and they treat them well. So I mean that's kind of a tough question to answer I mean it's almost it's something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously at the age that they'd be adopting them they obviously wouldn't know how to answer that question yeah. 

Recording: (4720/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4721/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4722/ 9621) 
 But how she got there, she started out somewhere. 

Recording: (4723/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, she probably got, I don't know, maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money, but it wouldn't have been enough welfare wise to get a car and to 

Recording: (4724/ 9621) 
 But it's mind boggling that it's, because I came from a small community. There were only 200 people in my senior class and you knew everybody. And now you're talking two whole high schools, two football teams. It's just mind boggling, all these people. You graduate with no handful of people and don't know anybody else. It's like a lot more of a tight knit group as a child. So we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it. 

Recording: (4725/ 9621) 
 because conceivably they wanted, what was it, a $2 raise or something? And then they also get free tuition, but only, as I understand it, only a very small percentage get that free tuition. 

Recording: (4726/ 9621) 
 Well, but see, I think if you really try to tell kids and especially women that, you know, you should, sex is something that should be between two people that love each other. And unless you really feel love and really think it is love, then, you know, you shouldn't do it. 

Recording: (4727/ 9621) 
 Right, right. Well, let me ask you about somebody else who's not that well known. Do you know John Gorka? Have you heard of him? He's really worth looking into. He's funny, he has good songs. He's a folk singer, really, along the lines of maybe Arlo Guthrie or somebody. I mean, he does electric stuff sometimes, but he also does acoustic, and he writes most of his own songs. Yeah, and if you ever see something by him, you should get it. Or if you see it in a friend's collection, ask to listen to it. He has funny, funny, some of the songs are really funny, and some of them are the saddest things you've ever heard. Yeah, yeah, just tragic things. Let's see, funny ones are, examples of funny ones are winter cows. Let's see. I can't think too much of them right now, but yeah. 

Recording: (4728/ 9621) 
 But just that freedom, you know, to do what you want, to get some sleep, to eat, to take care of yourself, to do a little investigation on your own, to pray about it, whatnot, and then it's really clear. But if you don't get that, and you're always thrust back into it, I don't think you can break free. 

Recording: (4729/ 9621) 
 I think. 

Recording: (4730/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4731/ 9621) 
 They've just gotten a lot worse. Like my niece, my sister had moved in with me for a little bit when her husband was having problems and my niece is eight. Well, she was in fifth grade and there's elementary school that we went to when we were kids and she just said they were cursing, smoking cigarettes and everything. And I just am like, oh my gosh. 

Recording: (4732/ 9621) 
 all of creation into religion. All of what spirituality is into one word, religion. You can't. But when you say it's of spiritual nature, that's still leaving the door wide open. It's broad. It's bigger than you or me. But that whole thing is, you know, the people of the land had specific instructions on how to do things. And I'm not saying they were perfect either. There were a lot of Indian people, and there are a lot of Indian people out there that are crooked as a dog's eye and leg. That's just the way it is. They're corrupt. The money has corrupted them. The lack of money has corrupted them. Power has corrupted them. They want to be a spiritual leader. Why? I don't know. To me it's an ego thing. And this Rainbow Eagle guy had some kind of buffalo, what do you call it, a buffalo ceremony, but he charged everybody. Native people don't do that. I mean, traditional Native people, you don't charge people that want to come learn about God. There's some people in California that say certain ceremonies were a Native thing and they buried a woman in the ground with a straw, told her it was some ritual of proving and overcoming fear. Yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was clothed Native American spirituality should be outlawed. And if you look at any kind of spirituality or religion that's out there, Native Americans are the only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can't have. That there's blood quantums saying that if you have a fourth or a half

 By the time you get there, you're all lagged out. 

Recording: (4740/ 9621) 
 God, I've seen a few infomercials on stuff like that, but I can't say anything too serious to come up from it. 

Recording: (4741/ 9621) 
 But you're working now, Janet. 

Recording: (4742/ 9621) 
 As much, probably.

 But he just didn't have a very high opinion of the Army.

 Everybody's code. 

Recording: (4747/ 9621) 
 So, it seems the picture is kind of hard to deal with. People that are into capitalism have a pretty good lives and they have what they want and they don't seem to have such serious problems. So, people who try to go against that current can get it their selves into big trouble. So, and capitalism has made the United States go. I mean, it has worked. And we are ahead of the world. There's no question about that in what the individual people, persons have and how their lives go, much better. On the other hand, you know, I'm actually what I would like if it would just spread all over the world true communism.

 of the people of this land. There's a ceremony called an inipi, which is a sweat lodge. And a lot of people talk about sweat lodge. It involves heating up stones in a fire and putting the stones in the lodge and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs. It's not a sauna. It's not a steam room.

Recording: (4752/ 9621) 
 You know, shoot him or whatever. 

Recording: (4753/ 9621) 
 He had a variety. Eighth grade is probably in some ways his better year. He had taken computer class for a grading period. It wasn't going well. They were teaching keyboarding, where he learned that when he was in third grade. So we were talking to the teacher, and I said, well, he's disruptive. He's supposed to be doing keyboarding exercises and he's writing programs. And he said, I knew the first day he was in here, he knew everything that I was going to teach this grading period. Well, that kind of flew up a red flag to me. Can you give him other assignments? Oh, no, he's got to do whatever Bounce is doing. So we went to the principal. And I was president of the parents' advisory committee at the time, so I had easy access to the principal. He took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library, and the librarian worked with him one-on-one, teaching database and spreadsheet applications to him. But he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us, his English teacher, and she told us, she said, he knows everything I want to teach. So I want your permission to give him a separate curriculum. And she did. He was using, reading books like Invisible Man by Elliman, Ellison, Ralph Ellison, and Elliman, I guess it is. Anyway, and writing papers on it. He was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story in that author's style. And she still tested him with the other kids just to make sure he hadn't missed anything. And he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this. And he loved it. And that's what he needed. But when we got to high school and we would talk to teachers about this, they said no, they couldn't do that. It was very frustrating.

 No, no, not at all. She's not watching Ashland.

 probably gonna lighten me again, you know. And then a lot of them I don't think are capable, well in the present condition, I know like the friend of mine I'm talking about, there is no way in hell that he could hold down a job. 

Recording: (4757/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's great. And they like it. They sing a song. They interact with other kids and learn to use the library. Nowadays, people don't go to the library as much. You either get your information off the internet or you buy books. So we've felt that if we introduce them now, that hopefully this will lead on later. And this way you can monitor their television. We let them rent a couple movies here and there, but we see what they rent or take out compared to the cartoon network and all these crazy... Cartoons just seem so worthless nowadays. But actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched and they seem more violent than some of the new ones. You know, Daffy Duck and the Road Runner and these type of things, all it was was Kill the Fox, you know. So we're just like, wow, I don't know if we want to let them watch that either. Yeah, and Disney, and Disney's pretty strong. I mean, you know, you think of Disney and you think of kids, but you still, a lot of the with them sometimes? that I think you'll be all right. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's tough sometimes. Read the paper at the same time. Yeah, yeah. Like the five-year-old's addicted to the Tarzan. He likes the Tarzan movie that was out. Yeah, he wants to. We've kind of boycotted him. The daughter wants to throw it away. Never. Don't have to watch that again.

 I plan at this point to pursue history to the PhD level. Anything, of course, can happen. 

Recording: (4761/ 9621) 
 This is weird. 

Recording: (4762/ 9621) 
 Well, I know, but you know, it struck me as funny at the time because that's the way it was worded. 

Recording: (4763/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4764/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well it was like I kind of just like stopped going to class and and like I Just like ended up withdrawing because I would have like failed everything anyways, but Yeah, then I was living with my friend for a while But and then like no no me and her and my other friend living down on Maynard and 

Recording: (4765/ 9621) 
 It's like right there. 

Recording: (4766/ 9621) 
 You have to go to dances, you have to do that whole thing. So I really don't know how they would go about doing that. Perhaps, like I know we used to have like, we had like the administrators actually allowed us to have a day where everyone, like the whole class as a class could go have a picnic, like in the practice football field. And that was cool because everyone got along those days because you didn't have to go to class. You know, you spend the second half of the day just hanging out. So everyone got along that way, and I think that would be a start, you know? But then that hurts the administrators in the sense that they're there to provide an education. So... It'd be rough. And like, my high school, they put up cameras and they had, like, they locked bathrooms. Like, at certain times you couldn't go in them. Like, it in like it was getting and they had like we're on the front page of the American Journal because they had a lockdown where no one was allowed to leave their classroom and then they brought the dogs through and they found I was surprised they found a lot of drugs 

Recording: (4767/ 9621) 
 They're prevented from doing much. Yeah. Yeah, I just don't think that they can do much. And I'm sure it's very frustrating for them. Well, and I know it is. We had a friend who was a teacher. She just retired a couple years ago. She's about our age. And it's very different now. She said it's scary going into the classroom sometimes. And before it wasn't that. You knew that if you had a problem you could make a, you know, go and get something dealt with it. Now you can't get backing on it. 

Recording: (4768/ 9621) 
 So he won't have to pay for it.

 Oh yeah.

 mhm

 Yes. 

Recording: (4772/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4773/ 9621) 
 Oh, exactly. I'm planning on just staying in the house if I can. Or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I know. I mean, we're gonna get some water and whatnot because you don't know people might turn things off like you said. 

Recording: (4774/ 9621) 
 I wish I could wear contacts. 

Recording: (4775/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and never got any better. Then they got in marching band and they were in that for four years and sometimes we noticed they marched and sometimes they didn't because they didn't learn their music, but they stayed with it. And they said then they like volunteered down at COSI. They didn't get paid a dime for this, but they did it because they enjoyed helping and deafness. Like they go, we want that student over there. Said you as a straight A student have proved nothing to us. And you over there. life at all. And the other one has activities and they're giving themselves to the community. Both my daughters have volunteered for the library reading program and then they went on and they volunteered at COSI and my oldest one was in Key Club and they would have Easter egg hunts for the school. It's a grade school and it's attached to Columbus Alternative High School. So I read a resume that she put in for a scholarship and it was explaining how the closest she got to crying at school was when she would do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no Easter candy and it was just, they were just so excited that the kids went out and bought like a dollar or two's worth of candy and hid it out and they'd have an Easter egg hunt for them at school. And she says, you know, those are the things that were important to her. And, you know, to me, that makes you feel like you're worth something. But the kids that go, you know, the ones that went to school, you know, I don't see any community service or I don't know about, I'm not a big gun hole, have to be religious person. I mean, I feel I'm a Christian, but I'm not a church goer. And I don't think you have to go there to be a religious person. But I think religion and community service and feeling like you have given something to the community and you're just not asking continuously for it, and trying things and failing at them and going, OK, well, but I still like to play basketball. I'm terrible, but I like to play. And I can't make the team so I'm going to try. it do the chat room stuff or the email stuff or sit down playing with video games. I think those are the ones that are the big problem with children. Mom and dad go, how can I get them to do something and stay out of my hair? Oh, I know, I'll buy them a Nintendo, I'll buy them this Sega, I'll buy them this. Look, they're out of my way. 

Recording: (4776/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, fine. Now it comes back to your statement. What do they tell us we need? Well no, well gee, we need a refrigerator, you need frost free, you need all these things. And you know what? You go down the street and see how many garage sales you have. And then you ask people, why'd you buy them? Oh, we thought we needed them. 

Recording: (4777/ 9621) 
 It's nice, they have a real nice arts festival every spring. If you ever get a chance, go down and march. 

Recording: (4778/ 9621) 
 Like I said, it'd just be the old generations with the black president, where now it'd be part of all generations that would still have a problem with it, and I think that'd be a bigger number.

 Mm-hmm. I've had I got a couple three applications in about the Kroger's and a dishwasher job for st. Angela's nursing home, which I kind of like doing stuff for People that like that, you know, I worked at a custodian at st. Robbie. I was a home for the aged but I had a problem dealing with a one-on-one basis with the older patients because they were just visiting, you know, they weren't there to stay. You know, you get kind of on a personal basis with them. Take a couple days off and you come in and you say, what happened to, oh, she passed away. I said, oh, Jesus, girl. I told her I was bringing her a pack of cigarettes, you know. So I mean, yeah, you get kind of attached to them and everything. Or then they get sick sick, you know. They move them up to, I used to always sit there and say, you know, this is the only place I've ever worked where a move up stairs isn't a promotion, you know. 

Recording: (4781/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4782/ 9621) 
 An example of that, I asked my manager the other day, she told me I was supposed to do this certain thing. And I asked her, I said, well, they told me I wasn't supposed to. 

Recording: (4783/ 9621) 
 I do that every once in a while, just like when I get bored. 

Recording: (4784/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4785/ 9621) 
 just because women have a medicine, you know? And probably because that was lacking in my life, I couldn't focus on what I needed to focus on when I heard a woman's voice in there. But then some of the elders sat me down. And the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts, women go in there in a long cotton dress. You'll hear people say you go in there naked, 

Recording: (4786/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4787/ 9621) 
 second and third. I was working 16-hour days a lot of times covering. That's one of the reasons they weren't going to move me. 

Recording: (4788/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (4789/ 9621) 
 So it was one of those. 

Recording: (4790/ 9621) 
 No, they're not. It's printed at the top on every issue that they are financially independent. 

Recording: (4791/ 9621) 
 I think I remember like they were like remodeling a few years back. Is that right? 

Recording: (4792/ 9621) 
 No, no, no, it's not. You can do whatever you want. I've heard conferences where, I've heard the prophet talk about how you should keep in touch with the people that you served in, or the people that you worked with and that you knew, and that they, even if you can't remember how to speak, just try and send them a letter. And I've been really bad about that, so I feel a lot of pressure to, I need to, I mean, I just don't want to lose contact with them, because you get these great friendships. But yeah, you can, there's, I know people that have married people from their, I mean, that's really not supposed to happen while you're on your mission, but when you're done, if you want to go back, that happens too. But it's really not looked. I mean, you shouldn't. That's against the rules on the mission. If people want to get married when they get home, that's fine. But yeah, it's another thing where you're trying to focus on your work and you're not allowed to date, never alone. But you can live where you served. You can do whatever you want after you're done. 

Recording: (4793/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4794/ 9621) 
 in a fashion that makes it almost diametrically opposed to mine a great many times, but at the same time the pre-religion understanding of something 

Recording: (4795/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (4796/ 9621) 
 Very much so. 

Recording: (4797/ 9621) 
 Three years, something like that. Hard to remember. It was a long time ago. 

Recording: (4798/ 9621) 
 Definitely, I'm such a slacker here, it's great. 

Recording: (4799/ 9621) 
 I forget, they have way more than, they dwarf any other state, I think. That to me is not, that's not admirable. That's one reason I wouldn't vote for Bush. 

Recording: (4800/ 9621) 
 Right. So a lot of them already believe that they have their own religion and they're really faithful. So that was one of the main problems is that they had been so holding on to that for so long, it's so strong, they don't want to let go of... And then the men, their problem was usually that they would drink a lot. 

Recording: (4801/ 9621) 
 I had enough friends who said to me, can you make money with computers? And I said, yes, you can make money with computers. And they said, what, could I make money with computers? 

Recording: (4802/ 9621) 
 I just do it for the stretch. It's almost like when I'm laying there and Kathy's saying, you know, take it, even though I sound speedy. 

Recording: (4803/ 9621) 
 Not really, there were too many rules there. 

Recording: (4804/ 9621) 
 And then as the community fanned out, then they had bigger houses. I like living in the old area better. I like the houses in the new areas better. There's one in particular that's just gorgeous. 

Recording: (4805/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think if I make the transfer, I'll definitely be happy about it. 

Recording: (4806/ 9621) 
 you know, in the sports, especially I think golf. 

Recording: (4807/ 9621) 
 All types. I used to work in the music industry, so I do a lot of music-related writing. In the position I'm in right now, I do just a variety of travel writing and that kind of thing. I concentrate primarily on editing. 

Recording: (4808/ 9621) 
 Awful. 

Recording: (4809/ 9621) 
 I got good neighbors. 

Recording: (4810/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure. I mean, I know no one's come to like, hey, you can get on this and you can get on that. I mean, I know my teacher, she said, I think it's called ADH or something, and they pay you to go to school. 

Recording: (4811/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4812/ 9621) 
 Not really. He's come to accept it, but it was her decision. It's one thing to know that it's the best thing for the baby, but it's another thing my wife and I are trying to deal with emotionally. We're very family oriented, that this is a grandchild we'll never get to see watch grow up. That's very hard on us. But it is an open adoption. They've met the couple several times. They promised to send pictures and keep them updated and stuff like that. 

Recording: (4813/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (4814/ 9621) 
 Carly at all, which I, you know, it's actually my family's business. So I started working there to help them out. But, you know, as I've been working there for a while, I want to move up, you know. So. 

Recording: (4815/ 9621) 
 Hm? 

Recording: (4816/ 9621) 
 There's a lot. We need to do a lot of evolving. We definitely do. 

Recording: (4817/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (4818/ 9621) 
 Well the thing, I mean, I know when my mom, my mom has a friend that adopted. 

Recording: (4819/ 9621) 
 Some of them are athletes. They're pretty much just preppy, student council. I'm good at school, but bad outside of school. They go out and party outside of school, but they join all the students against drugs programs. 

Recording: (4820/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (4821/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (4822/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean you generally could, I mean they didn't broadcast it obviously but... 

Recording: (4823/ 9621) 
 I could not see myself doing that. 

Recording: (4824/ 9621) 
 And you probably know that they're, well, they're four and, I think they're four and five right now. 

Recording: (4825/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah. But those tend to be my least favorite concerts, although our conductor tries hard to make it interesting for orchestra members by bringing in some music that's interesting, challenging, or whatever for orchestra. We're lucky to have him. He's an associate conductor for the Columbus Symphony. He's very good. I'm glad that we have him as a conductor. I was in the orchestra when we selected him. We auditioned, I think, five, four or five conductors over the course of a year. We had each one for a different concert. And we ended up picking him. Yeah. 

Recording: (4826/ 9621) 
 You know, it's terrible. 

Recording: (4827/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4828/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (4829/ 9621) 
 Probably not, it's a fad, they're gonna move along and move out of it. 

Recording: (4830/ 9621) 
 no kind of, you know, it just seems like our society just has that. You have to be just horrible to a person because they're bad. Well, you and I know that a bad person doesn't become better by being bad to them. 

Recording: (4831/ 9621) 
 She's actually at Columbus State. She's going to study to be a teacher. 

Recording: (4832/ 9621) 
 I do some yoga and I do some weights and I have a stepper that I absolutely love. I have it down there so I can 

Recording: (4833/ 9621) 
 new kid, the boyfriend, girlfriend, the different things they were trying behind the building, you know, and just the boy, girl, I mean just not nice. No. 

Recording: (4834/ 9621) 
 Not too much. I was planning on, I hadn't always planned on taking a year off, but getting into the research, one of the things I sacrificed was looking into grad schools and applying to grad school this past year. I'd like to go here, it's one of my choices, because I like the faculty and I like the program, but I plan to spend the next couple of months, well the first few months after I graduate, looking at other schools. 

Recording: (4835/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4836/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she's kind of the, well she does all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff, but as far as the carpenter work, we have this one guy that's been doing stuff for our house for a long time, or 

Recording: (4837/ 9621) 
 He's got his first name too. 

Recording: (4838/ 9621) 
 I was bored in high school and I wasn't all that bright. 

Recording: (4839/ 9621) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (4840/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, it's 350 a week for 40 hours. But I like the hours more than anything because it's 2 to 10. 

Recording: (4841/ 9621) 
 That's right. 

Recording: (4842/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4843/ 9621) 
 Amazing how much the growth in Delaware and different areas when I was growing up here and how Marysville and it was such a farm town Just the growth of the different cities and suburbs of Columbus is amazing and the housing and 

Recording: (4844/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't know why. Columbus was just stubborn about it until the last year. They hadn't been able to get substitutes 50% of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms. Well, I don't know if the parents made anything about it, but I guess finally, you know, when you have 50% of your classrooms uncovered, they came to it. And it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute. Nobody. The kids, the principal, or the other teachers. But now it's like, oh, thank you for coming. Oh, thank you for coming. So I said maybe that worked a little bit. But now just in the last two weeks, I think a lot of the retired teachers who weren't messing around with it have come back in. So I don't know exactly what's... 

Recording: (4845/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4846/ 9621) 
 And I do my job and sometimes that basically hurts worse than, if you do your job and people know you do your job, you got more people that'll stick up for you without knowing it. 

Recording: (4847/ 9621) 
 don't waste like thirty dollars on the commemorative coins or something and i don't even know what they're doing or to like when it's really apparent that people shouldn't be charging this on their credit card when it's like you put in one credit card and it doesn't go through because it's max h one i'm like no don't do that like we can do that you can get in trouble or whatever and it's just funny how it's real weird at our office that um... uh... is it the first place that I've been to where you clock in, that's kind of odd. Kind of like think of a factory, like a punch card or something. And just how, there's this whole thing, we can't wear hats in the building, and this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff. It's just real funny to hear people speak like that and really believe it. 

Recording: (4848/ 9621) 
 He is 7 months. He's climbing on stuff and everything. 

Recording: (4849/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (4850/ 9621) 
 talk to them or whatever, you know. I tell people they can go there. It's a VVA, Vietnam Veterans Association. Some people don't even know about it, you know. 

Recording: (4851/ 9621) 
 I've always heard, and I'm very clean anyways, but when you have to vacuum a lot and everything and you're constantly picking up that dander, rather than just let it sit and accumulate. 

Recording: (4852/ 9621) 
 And you're loving it too. At least you're trying to convince yourself of it. 

Recording: (4853/ 9621) 
 Well, there's, I mean, pretty much you just keep making calls, making appointments, sending out slides. It helps if you can get a, you know, if you know an artist who's in a gallery, you know, if you can use them as a reference. But that it's mainly just, you just have to knock on a lot of doors and be prepared for a lot of no's. 

Recording: (4854/ 9621) 
 A lot of exciting stuff going on now for libraries. It's not the old lady in the bun. Yeah, and the web has really changed that. 

Recording: (4855/ 9621) 
 Depends on how I store it now When I was a kid raised up we had gun locks on our guns, even though I could pick them. I mean it 

Recording: (4856/ 9621) 
 Um, my, both of them are older. My sister's like 27, 28. My brother's 24. 

Recording: (4857/ 9621) 
 the mall issue. 

Recording: (4858/ 9621) 
 He just looked up at you like, what are you talking about? He smiles at me when I talk to him. 

Recording: (4859/ 9621) 
 And let's see, my youngest son's wife is a teacher in the Catholic schools, elementary schools. And my second son's wife works for the Columbus School System as a secretary and actually transcribing notes for people, for men who are writing books or papers or whatever. 

Recording: (4860/ 9621) 
 when I would run away from foster homes. 

Recording: (4861/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (4862/ 9621) 
 I think they should be. I think they should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny that hetero couples are, you know, with home visits and economic tests and all these kind of things. But the gay people I know, the ones that would want to be parents, I think would make great parents. 

Recording: (4863/ 9621) 
 I think just having like such a low cost really helps. 

Recording: (4864/ 9621) 
 People can't understand. 

Recording: (4865/ 9621) 
 games. I don't know, we vary it from one week to the next. 

Recording: (4866/ 9621) 
 She was the rudest woman. 

Recording: (4867/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4868/ 9621) 
 So family, familiarity, and just the community, I think. If you had to name three negative things about Columbus, what would you say? What would you choose? Crime, I think, is going up and up. Traffic is horrendous. But I mean, you need to go through that right now because Columbus is expanding so much that we need the orange Brails and I Guess the lack of publicity nationally, I think we don't have you know, like the national football teams and Now with the hockey coming, I think we're getting more recognition But when people talk about about Columbus, I don't think they know Columbus, Ohio or Columbus, Georgia or Columbus. Where, right. 

Recording: (4869/ 9621) 
 not doing anything. My son, you know, with his disorder, he would constantly be late for school. And I called the school and told them, this was in high school, 

Recording: (4870/ 9621) 
 Yeah, woo. And you know, at the time I was like, I'm not going to get anything out of this. And it was misery and whatnot. But I've met people that have been in much worse situations. And at least I can kind of relate to them. 

Recording: (4871/ 9621) 
 just to make it easier on everybody. 

Recording: (4872/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4873/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Recording: (4874/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (4875/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my dog's at home. 

Recording: (4876/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (4877/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (4878/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4879/ 9621) 
 Some of the really hard questions. Why do bad things happen to good people? People can't just accept that bad things happen to good people. They wanna know why. I don't know why. I mean, yeah, I have a personal relationship with my God, but we're not on a conversational, I'm on this side of the table, you're on that side of the table. Why did this happen? He doesn't see fit to tell me why something happens, unless it pertains to me. Let's see, what's another really hard one? One of the biggest ones with people my age is apologetics. Apologetics, which is going out and saying, you're a sinner except Christ. Everybody on this campus has heard of Brother Jed. He runs around on the oval going, slut, whore, yada, yada, yada. And that's just, I mean, there are a lot of people within the community of Christians who can't stand that. We don't like what he's doing. Because, yeah, I'm one of them. Because we have to go back, anyone who has been influenced by him, we have to go back and we have to undo all the damage he's done before we can really start in on them. And helping them to understand what we're trying to tell them. We have to undo what Brother Jed has done because he's just, I mean, yeah, maybe his heart's in the right place, but he's doing it the wrong way. But one of the big things is, right after you're done doing all of the spiel about why you think they should accept Christ in their life, they say, okay, that's good for you. And that's the general feeling among people our age, our generation. I mean, what generation are we anyways? I'm 20, so there's like the generation X, they're the generation right after me, and then there's generation Y2K, they're the generation right before me, so we're stuck right in the middle. I don't even think we have a generation. 

Recording: (4880/ 9621) 
 Just kidding. 

Recording: (4881/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's on Olentangy down there, north of there. 

Recording: (4882/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4883/ 9621) 
 or a town. 

Recording: (4884/ 9621) 
 where I don't think that there's any question they could look right down our throats because, and anyway, we fired a couple times from there. They started firing back at us and, man, scared me. 

Recording: (4885/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4886/ 9621) 
 I think that influences how everybody behaves, not only the kids, the adults too. 

Recording: (4887/ 9621) 
 Great. 

Recording: (4888/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he's like that. 

Recording: (4889/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I would be at least 30 maybe, like getting up towards 40 before I have the experience really necessary to get in a good job. I don't want to be, I mean like, my venturing crew advisor is 38 and retired. I mean, I'm going more for there. 

Recording: (4890/ 9621) 
 Because they like it. They like school and that's why they came to college. Football was secondary. 

Recording: (4891/ 9621) 
 Well, the problem is, like say, every airline wants to go to New York City and they want all their businessmen there at 8 a.m. Well, an airport has so many runways and so many taxiways and, you know, like say, 10 airplanes every 10 minutes can come in and out of those airports. Well, they end up shooting like 30 there. So instead of letting them all get in the air and stand up there and hold while they're shooting them in, what they do is they'll like say going to O'Hare, you have to call for release times to these different airports. And they will say, well, he can't go right now, but he can go like at 27 past the hour. So they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport, when he will fit in. So it's not so much air traffic delays, it's airlines that cause it themselves. It's like you and I and 500 people want to get to this room 10 o'clock today. Well, rather than say, why don't some of you come at 10 and another group come at 1015, and we're all trying to do the same thing at once and it doesn't work work. You can only get so many people through that door, and if you say, I'm going to take five at a time, they can get in, but if you say, I'm taking 500 at a time, it doesn't work. The airlines always go, it's the government and regulations, and that's why we're delayed, and it's really them themselves, 

Recording: (4892/ 9621) 
 I mean, you talk to people in the Catholic Church about the unseen, meaning the spiritual realm, and they freak out. 

Recording: (4893/ 9621) 
 Well, if he has that bottle at four, he'll wake maybe up around six or seven. I normally wake up at six anyway, so it doesn't matter. So I'm ready for him then. 

Recording: (4894/ 9621) 
 I have to go to bed so early.

 She was a cowboy and he was an Indian. 

Recording: (4896/ 9621) 
 Unfortunately, we weren't in the country, so we didn't know. 

Recording: (4897/ 9621) 
 It wasn't so much of a hate thing, it was just more, these are the people I like to hang out with. If you don't like that, that's fine. 

Recording: (4898/ 9621) 
 I do. 

Recording: (4899/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (4900/ 9621) 
 to make me healthy or whatever because I've always been really healthy. 

Recording: (4901/ 9621) 
 Okay. Well, I'm not adopting that role. And fortunately, the judge of our game isn't listening to our conversation, so I feel kind of safe. A mutual friend, a much better friend of mine than of hers, but she's more attractive than I am, so we figured it all balanced out. We decided that made him unbiased. 

Recording: (4902/ 9621) 
 year. 

Recording: (4903/ 9621) 
 I don't really go over to the east side very often. Sometimes we'd go over in high school and drive around and see if we could see a prostitute or something like that. I don't really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things. I don't know if it's the media that portrays us there's more than there used to be. I know that when I was younger I was allowed to do a lot more things by myself, like to go places on the bus and those types of things than my family is allowed to do now. 

Recording: (4904/ 9621) 
 I don't know. Yeah, so it's kind of like I'm for education and schools, but just like the bad things about it, you know, sex can do, you can get pregnant. Number one. 

Recording: (4905/ 9621) 
 personally. 

Recording: (4906/ 9621) 
 really oh my god and then you can hash mark them if you want we didn't but you could and we had two people who said you're kidding and then said never mind I'm sorry pretend I never even said that I was like wow somebody must have done this before because everybody was just like there's no other response but 

Recording: (4907/ 9621) 
 Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe 

Recording: (4908/ 9621) 
 Well, I'm very much, my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not kill, and that goes really a long ways for me. That includes being a vegetarian and most of our wars I would have said no, let's not do this yet. Although on the other hand, I have to admit that there has been some stuff that we haven't been able to stop without it. And that's too bad, you know, that things have been that bad in some, like a World War II. I mean, we didn't really have any choice there. But some of our wars have been unnecessary. But you can get a philosophy, but it doesn't always apply every single case. You know what I mean? I am against capital punishment. The guy that they executed here in Ohio last fall, did you know about it? 

Recording: (4909/ 9621) 
 That's what I would think in that case. I mean, because the dominant culture is always going to be accessible to them. 

Recording: (4910/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but if you were the first state in the union to do it, it'll cost you millions and millions and it'd be rough. It'd be so hard to... 

Recording: (4911/ 9621) 
 If he hits somebody in the eye, obviously it's going to hurt him, but most of the time

 for everybody so you wouldn't go to Ivy League, you don't even want to look here. 

Recording: (4913/ 9621) 
 It'd almost be better if they let the dog go over because, you know, she's going to bring in mud and grass and it's not going to be perfect. Maybe knock something over, you know, kind of start with her. But you have to go home. You know what I mean? 

Recording: (4914/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (4915/ 9621) 
 But I don't know. 

Recording: (4916/ 9621) 
 Um, not really. He, I mean, he obviously went to church too for at least a few years while my parents were still together. But, I mean, since then, I mean, there's really nothing about him. 

Recording: (4917/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's a change of pace and plus being around my sister instead of, you know, taking the 20 mile lag all the way up there, just go a couple blocks over and there she is. 

Recording: (4918/ 9621) 
 Really? What did he tell you? 

Recording: (4919/ 9621) 
 And so basically they decided to build a new building adjacent to the church, Tacton. And we, they asked the choir for input. 

Recording: (4920/ 9621) 
 No, it was more black than white, to tell you the truth. Or it might have been even, but now it's more black than white, definitely now. Because I live in a neighborhood where it's mostly black than white, and that's where I've always lived my whole life. 

Recording: (4921/ 9621) 
 it's like it is um... it's like there's flyers and stuff that you see or whatever and you get directions to it and it'll be in a bunch of different places it'll be in a sports arena or something or it depends how big they are there's ones where there's like two hundred people there's ones where there's like five there's ones where there's a thousand there's ones where there are like three thousand and there's ones in can, I didn't go to one but some of my friends went to it, where there's like fifteen thousand people there or something like that. 

Recording: (4922/ 9621) 
 and they do everything they possibly can to make me happy. And it's like my oldest girl, we're expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks, and she and I see each other all the time. My daughter, who goes to, chose to live at home because she just said it was just a better situation for her. And it's not that these girls aren't independent and can't do it on their own. Megan could, my second daughter, could have lived on her own from the time she was 12. I mean, she's just very, very mature, very driven. The only problem she has, she didn't have a job to support herself. Other than that, she could have taken care of herself. But she chooses to be still at home and be a part of our life. And my son, both those kids have four points. I mean, they really work hard in school because they know it's important. And my son was, he was the only one that was in seventh and eighth grade. He took that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at 16. And so I'm really lucky that we had our difficulty at that point and it was minimal. But to me, having been used to everything being perfect, it was like for him to have... 

Recording: (4923/ 9621) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (4924/ 9621) 
 Grandchildren. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

Recording: (4925/ 9621) 
 And then my family moved to Clinton Valley. We kind of lived up there. 

Recording: (4926/ 9621) 
 Yeah, dilutes. There's only so much talent, so it dilutes it. 

Recording: (4927/ 9621) 
 which was the purpose of his book, I suppose. 

Recording: (4928/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (4929/ 9621) 
 and I was crying the whole time just that little pain my mom was laughing at me it wasn't funny and to watch they left out parts you know if you talk to people when they have babies and they oh it's the worst pain but you'll forget about it they left out that whole part where they put the epidural in you and you you 

Recording: (4930/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but he has to still support the Union. So yeah, that's that's a rough place to be in But uh, does the Union like when people go on strike does the Union help support the people that aren't getting pay then or? 

Recording: (4931/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (4932/ 9621) 
 Right. Yeah. 

Recording: (4933/ 9621) 
 Oh, right. 

Recording: (4934/ 9621) 
 And then when you don't, take it easy. 

Recording: (4935/ 9621) 
 very big differences stuck together on a small ship. They just glassed over those and it became just like the next generation except for they didn't talk to the Federation as much anymore. So I didn't like that one so much.

 He's an aeronautical engineer. He started off here in Columbus at Janitrol. They went out of business. Then he went to Urbana for Grimes Aerospace and they ended up merging. And now there's really no aerospace things in Columbus, Ohio. So he's working for Planes City, which is kind of heating and cooling air conditioning systems. And so he's using his airflow design. 

Recording: (4937/ 9621) 
 and anyone you come across could be getting, I don't know, I guess weird ideas of your kids or whatever. 

Recording: (4938/ 9621) 
 invited to come down and be saved. 

Recording: (4939/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4940/ 9621) 
 Some of them are all of the above. And some of them aren't. There's quite a few of them that have adjusted well to society when they came home. Biggest thing I think when, what happened is that there wasn't any joy about like World War II and Korea. You know, it's like you came off, got off the plane and nobody really cared, you know. 

Recording: (4941/ 9621) 
 That's a rule coming down hand down. 

Recording: (4942/ 9621) 
 Yeah, where the trees were mature and they didn't really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees. 

Recording: (4943/ 9621) 
 I told her, well, that's just my identification there. You look on my license, nobody can copy that. You see where the A, U, and M is my last name. 

Recording: (4944/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (4945/ 9621) 
 I'm glad I interrupted your dinner, fine, whatever. Some people would be really nice, and other people would just be unbelievably rude, it was so funny. But now I do this work at this place called, I worked there with, works there too, so, I mean, I worked at a telemarketing place too, with me, so it makes it bearable. Like, it just, because I worked there for a while before she did and it was just really annoying. But both places it's cubicles and that's really weird too. Cubicles are odd how that develops. 

Recording: (4946/ 9621) 
 Four years ago? I don't know. It's been a while. Four and a half years ago, something like that. 

Recording: (4947/ 9621) 
 very well and her vocabulary is limited and she didn't know how to spell or know any bigger words. So I tried to sit her down and give her a little refresher. Coming from a New Jersey public school and doing a study, then a couple of these different places you never even hear of like I don't know Cal Powell Kentucky or wherever you want to you know some small town would have this great teaching 

Recording: (4948/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (4949/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I was 16 when I got out of high school, and then I took my GED at 17 and passed it. Plus, I went in Marine Corps at 17. 

Recording: (4950/ 9621) 
 Okay, that's not... It was better before. There, that's better. That's okay. I'll just try that. 

Recording: (4951/ 9621) 
 You said that usually a girl, do you have a learning disability, they usually get everything down off the board. Whereas the boys will get a little distracted or they'll, you know, maybe not sit, they don't tend to sit up front. They'll sit in the back so they can, you know, jab their friend with a pencil and throw the paper wads and stuff. 

Recording: (4952/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he's teaching us system five. It's just funny. 

Recording: (4953/ 9621) 
 But here, it's just to see how much success you can have and then they just want to leave. But we can look forward to the basketball season. I think he's a good coach. 

Recording: (4954/ 9621) 
 bug the room. 

Recording: (4955/ 9621) 
 I went to private schools for a long time. 

Recording: (4956/ 9621) 
 Cause I would have got my ass whipped. 

Recording: (4957/ 9621) 
 It's a lot of money. 

Recording: (4958/ 9621) 
 Nobody ever you know what they wanted me to do is put him on a riddle And I didn't like him on riddle. I didn't like what it did to him 

Recording: (4959/ 9621) 
 Right, and just going over it and over it and over it. 

Recording: (4960/ 9621) 
 But the first lieutenant who was our—in command of the battery at that time—said, 

Recording: (4961/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4962/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (4963/ 9621) 
 No, I don't. 

Recording: (4964/ 9621) 
 It was, supposedly it was my job, but as you know, the parents always get stuck. I have a brother. 

Recording: (4965/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (4966/ 9621) 
 and that's not a life. 

Recording: (4967/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4968/ 9621) 
 I'm sure you played with it too. 

Recording: (4969/ 9621) 
 It was like give them a license to be a screw up. A lot of the nurses even who were former addicts, when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done, they weren't following protocol. And of course me, I'd be the one saying, hey, you're not following protocol. And they'd say, well, I'm a former addict. I'm allowed to do that. 

Recording: (4970/ 9621) 
 It's just a challenge to figure out how to make something work. I'm just incredibly optimistic. I really feel like whatever happens to me, it's my responsibility to help it happen, take care of it, deal with it. I always have a backup plan.

 So, you know, downstairs there's five different sectors, so they split the area up into five different areas. And, you know, there are some sectors down there that get extremely busy, and then sometimes it's just like, you know, you're twiddling your thumbs. It's like feast or famine. You know, it's not like steady, like if you're working at Meijer running the cash register, it's just kind of like steady. It's like you look at, you know, you'd be like sitting at Meijer and there's no one in your line, and then you turn your back and turn back around and there's like 75 

Recording: (4973/ 9621) 
 I mean, you know, I have little thoughts of like I like to design. I'm maybe a designer, but you know, like I went to I was in police law enforcement. 

Recording: (4974/ 9621) 
 I come from the East Coast. 

Recording: (4975/ 9621) 
 and the people that would be decent parent aren't because of the situations and whatnot. Just my family, nobody in my family, my sister doesn't have kids, I don't have kids. We're in our mid to late 30s. Our friends just had one. I do have some friends that have like more than one, which is great, because they're just great parents. I know those kids are gonna be going in. But then I have other people that, like my other friends that just had one, were trying to help a child in children's services that came from horror. 

Recording: (4976/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they gave us $9 a day. It was like $9.25 for what meal plan I was on. So then we bought like Pop-Tarts, and that lasted for like a week of breakfast. 

Recording: (4977/ 9621) 
 Stop. Yeah, those are real chemicals. 

Recording: (4978/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (4979/ 9621) 
 So this is my first time like a doggie. So. 

Recording: (4980/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4981/ 9621) 
 Well, the opinion, kind of, like the general consensus around Upper Arlington is that OSU is not a good enough school. 

Recording: (4982/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (4983/ 9621) 
 this is the there's no faulting any of these folks but still there's nothing else to do and there's nothing creative in response to say this experience so you end up with your kidding again and again and again and you had two individuals who said you're kidding and then immediately following it out never mind pretend I never said that 

Recording: (4984/ 9621) 
 Sure. 

Recording: (4985/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4986/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there were white skinheads at our school that were racist against me for hanging around black people. I guess I'm sure there was black people that were racist too. But not in school, I didn't have problems really. 

Recording: (4987/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I actually have a bunch of numbers here that I hope I didn't lose. Yeah, I got three people to call, see about jobs there. Should be in within the middle of the week. Yeah, because gas money's... I can do construction, cooking. I actually took Columbus Public Schools cooking test and passed it. So I'm technically a cook. 

Recording: (4988/ 9621) 
 Right? But how old is your kid? 

Recording: (4989/ 9621) 
 Anyway. 

Recording: (4990/ 9621) 
 Neither one of them is married or have kids. My sister does have a boyfriend for probably like three years or so. And there is talk about marriage and kids and stuff like that with them. 

Recording: (4991/ 9621) 
 Really. 

Recording: (4992/ 9621) 
 That's cool. 

Recording: (4993/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (4994/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (4995/ 9621) 
 I like management here. 

Recording: (4996/ 9621) 
 Those are your...

 Hmm, how'd you end up in Ohio? 

Recording: (4998/ 9621) 
 the food service and she knows that they're really bad. And that's really sad but they're not doing anything about it. 

Recording: (4999/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5000/ 9621) 
 Right, right. Well, it's sort of a problem as well that, you know, those, I mean, it seems, you know, from what I've read, if you wanted to make a bomb, it's fairly uncomplicated, you know, so. 

Recording: (5001/ 9621) 
 That's right. In other words, it's so much me anymore instead of us and we. 

Recording: (5002/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5003/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's not like a skilled profession to me. 

Recording: (5004/ 9621) 
 But see that's because I don't think Americans travel as much as the Europeans do. I guess because Europeans, they have more public transportation accessible. They get the trains, the Eurotrains and the buses. But just by personal car you can go across the border, you can go visit countries. It's so condensed. But here it's like we've got our oceans and it's like we gotta fly. So I think that's why I think Europeans are much more cooler in that respect. They're much more cosmopolitan. Just because it's no big deal for somebody in Europe to speak like seven languages. Right here it's like you, who actually knows English. You know? So I think that's what I'll find, hopefully. Hopefully. 

Recording: (5005/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5006/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5007/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think it is further east than where I was. I was right in the Ural Mountains, so it's like the border of Europe and Asia. 

Recording: (5008/ 9621) 
 So they're close, but I try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who's a nice charitable human being. The others are all nice and sweet and stuff, but don't have enough rewarding characteristics to make me want to spend lots of time around them. 

Recording: (5009/ 9621) 
 It is and it was World War two that brought them together My my dad was In at the end of the war he was in the Army Air Corps. He never had to go overseas But he was stationed in Louisiana 

Recording: (5010/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5011/ 9621) 
 Not so much old Star Trek. I like Deep Space Nine of the new ones. Back when it was new, I liked the next generation, but once Deep Space Nine came out and it had a grittier, darker story that wasn't so cookie cutter in fashion, there was a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode and more character development. It wasn't like these perfect people on this ship going and facing bad people. The characters themselves had flaws and that caused for better drama. So I like that. Don't like Voyager so much. I see that when it first came out I had high hopes because I saw it as something that would be even grittier. They had the potential for excellent inter-character conflict but they glossed over all those immediately within the first season and that really bothered me. Ultimately this story, they're trapped but they don't really pursue the issues of being separated from home and two factions that had 

Recording: (5012/ 9621) 
 They settled in Springfield, Ohio. And then my mom met my father. He was from Petoskey. They met here at OSU when they were going to college. And they settled here in Columbus. 

Recording: (5013/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5014/ 9621) 
 You know, she says something about, you sure you're not a football player or something? You know, you got that significant signature there going. 

Recording: (5015/ 9621) 
 And I would definitely keep an eye out and figure out what's going on. 

Recording: (5016/ 9621) 
 You hang out like I don't know it's more of like a super like a suburban town as opposed to like a centralized downtown Yeah, it's just like You know like a half an hour I mean 20 minutes outside you can get to Dublin or 15 minutes to Dublin or something like that and I mean that's still like a part of Columbus as opposed to Yeah. 

Recording: (5017/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5018/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they have, well, OK, they do have sales tax, but it's added into the price before. So you're not just sitting there trying to figure out what it is. 

Recording: (5019/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (5020/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5021/ 9621) 
 Right, and all the babies in the hospital will be covered under my son's insurance, and she's covered under her father's insurance. So their medical expenses are not going to be very big. 

Recording: (5022/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you go to class in one building, and you go across the yard to another. And then you go to lunch, and then you come across another, and your locker, and all that stuff. It's just like a mini campus. 

Recording: (5023/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (5024/ 9621) 
 So, I don't know. She likes it. 

Recording: (5025/ 9621) 
 Yeah, man, I don't want to be over in the next County, you know driving in the middle of the sky going Yeah, a couple people down there floating around under me 

Recording: (5026/ 9621) 
 And it seems to be a fairly conservative university as well. 

Recording: (5027/ 9621) 
 I mean, not that I don't want to be on welfare, it's like a down when I want to go up, you know? 

Recording: (5028/ 9621) 
 Uh, as well, actually when I was at Ohio State I worked for the newspaper. 

Recording: (5029/ 9621) 
 How'd you do this to me? 

Recording: (5030/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5031/ 9621) 
 But that's because I'm not home a lot. And like I said, my wife's here. Now her mom just moved to Texas. So she's living down in Texas. And she's got brothers and sisters all over the United States. 

Recording: (5032/ 9621) 
 Um, it's probably worse. I mean, actually, just wait for my last experiments. I heard a couple people talking about it, talking about it. 

Recording: (5033/ 9621) 
 Not this job, no. 

Recording: (5034/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (5035/ 9621) 
 Right? And that's it. They haven't had a challenge. You need to have a challenge that's put to you every day. Every day. So you have more meaningfulness in life. So that when you put your head down at night, you're saying, you know, I'm thankful for what I did. Gosh darn it, I'm still coming to you. I need more help tomorrow. Because without something intangible, there's going to be a motivation factor. Something's got to give you the adrenaline to get up tomorrow morning and say, hey, I'm going to do a better job today than I did yesterday. something lower the bar a little more. 

Recording: (5036/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5037/ 9621) 
 I don't know and well, I don't know for a while we got it stopped. The thing that is confusing to me is that sometimes we'll get something stopped for 25 or 30 years or 10 or 15 and then we go back. It's like, hey, we got moved ourselves out of that. Why are we going back to it now? And I think, you know, the papers keep saying that our crime rate is going down and everything. And so I think that's because we, some people are, you know, trying to make it, deal with these people as people who are ill or sick and try to help them with their, you know, it took us a long time to figure out that alcoholism is a disease, okay? So now we try to help alcoholics. Well, certainly murdering is a disease. 

Recording: (5038/ 9621) 
 No, this all started long before that. Actually, just recently he seems to have accepted the idea that yes, the baby's going to be born. I think he just kind of tried to ignore it for a long time. But I think it's all very obvious now. And she's great. 

Recording: (5039/ 9621) 
 Does your husband like that? 

Recording: (5040/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (5041/ 9621) 
 He is. 

Recording: (5042/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (5043/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they went and won the Super Bowl and then went back and lost the Super Bowl. 

Recording: (5044/ 9621) 
 I mean, I personally wouldn't care. If I was in a foxhole with somebody, I could care less whether he was gay or not, as long as he could shoot a gun to help me out if I was in trouble. 

Recording: (5045/ 9621) 
 I don't want to like I don't want to spin like I just want to like I'm gonna try and do different things like like Most music I listen to is like drum and bass where it's like bass lines and like 

Recording: (5046/ 9621) 
 if they have someone who gets a grant who's already planning to go to their schools. 

Recording: (5047/ 9621) 
 I mean obviously I mean that's how little boys are or whatever 

Recording: (5048/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. 

Recording: (5049/ 9621) 
 I don't know. She doesn't move anymore and she has to. I'm the one that loves to exercise. 

Recording: (5050/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (5051/ 9621) 
 and not all of them are Vietnam vets either. 

Recording: (5052/ 9621) 
 no asking each other opinions or anything like that. 

Recording: (5053/ 9621) 
 I'd be a lot more accepted, I think, here. Even though it might be kind of, I wouldn't do that on my own. But if I'm, I felt like that was what I was doing all the time. So I went full time. 

Recording: (5054/ 9621) 
 Thanks. I don't feel like a grandma either, so I have to be careful what I do. They still watch me, I guess. 

Recording: (5055/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, and you know, they're like $350 for a pack of cards. You don't even get gum like we used to with the baseball cards. Yeah, you get, I don't know, five, six cards for $350. And I'm like, jeez, you count every time you go to the store, they got them all in there, checkout, let's get the cards. Now they've done the first $150, they're moving on to series two. Oh, they are, they're killing on it, they really are. 

Recording: (5056/ 9621) 
 I feel. 

Recording: (5057/ 9621) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (5058/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5059/ 9621) 
 And you learn what you have to to get through the test, of course. I did that when I was here at school. 

Recording: (5060/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (5061/ 9621) 
 That's sad. 

Recording: (5062/ 9621) 
 I can't believe it. That just blows my mind. You can spend all thousands of dollars just for a wedding. 

Recording: (5063/ 9621) 
 He's seven months. 

Recording: (5064/ 9621) 
 He'll pour all the water that's left in that bucket and he'll do it in a way that just brings that heat out, that steam, that breath, that sacred breath is what we call it. 

Recording: (5065/ 9621) 
 That's fine. 

Recording: (5066/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5067/ 9621) 
 It seems that way. I don't know why that is. You know, in the 80s, they had a lot of games where like, one to two, you know, shutouts, stuff like that. Now, I mean, my roommate was telling me the Yankees beat someone 21 to something the other day.

 Mm-hmm. And the wrong, it was just wasn't the right time. I had money, you know, I got like a settlement, like $37,000. Not a settlement, but when I sold my stocks and everything, I got like $37,000 and put about 5,000 here, 5,000 there, still had 20, you know. Started a business and money was coming in and using the money for other things and not realizing that, hey, you're supposed to be putting that money back in the business, you know. But I was running around with a bunch of other people that basically were doing the same thing, you know. 

Recording: (5069/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5070/ 9621) 
 Oh man.

 He's just sitting there, okay? That's not normal. And he comes home, you're talking to him? Yeah, it's not like you're here to talk to.

 When I worked at bars, I carried a gun constantly, and most of the cops in the neighborhood knew I carried a gun. 

Recording: (5073/ 9621) 
 And basically, they were three weeks long. They were about four and a half hours. The first one was really long. Jason was like, I can't take this. Last night wasn't so bad, though. I mean, the first one was a lot of information classroom kind of stuff. But he did real well. He was much, he's just so sweet. He's just wonderful. He was much more interactive than a lot of the other guys were, just kind of, you know, they would sit there and they weren't breathing and they were kind of rolling their eyes. And I just think, God, you bunch of bums, you know, it's going to come down to it, you know, and you're going to be so awful. And he's just real supportive and just, he's just terrific. So it makes it better. 

Recording: (5074/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (5075/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5076/ 9621) 
 So how many years did you actually were there teaching? Three. Three years. Wow. It was fun. I recommend it.

 Not usually 52 deck cards, but other interesting types of cards. 

Recording: (5080/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I would. She was like a community liaison with our corporation. So I was a supervisor on my job and sometimes I would have very, very difficult clients that I needed advice from her on how to go about working with them. And I would call her and she would just be really rude not helpful. 

Recording: (5081/ 9621) 
 That was great. 

Recording: (5082/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. And it seems to me that they don't keep the very, very best of the kids in state, but it gets a lot of the, like, just below the absolute best in. It keeps a lot of them here. 

Recording: (5083/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5084/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5085/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5086/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I have two older brothers. One's 10 years older, the other one's 15 years older. 

Recording: (5087/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, we met at where we there's a singles ward where we call ward it's on 12th Avenue down here and it's just where all the single people under 30 go to church and there's dances and different activities and

 I am signed up for architecture right now, which I like architecture, but I think there's probably more time into it than I'm ready to actually commit into it. 

Recording: (5089/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I like baseball. I used to like that a lot better when I was younger. But no, I wouldn't take the time to sit and watch a whole baseball game on TV. 

Recording: (5090/ 9621) 
 you

 I mean my, oh my sister said if you didn't leave him I was going to staple your hair to the wall. I mean, no, she was joking. She wasn't kidding though. Because, you know, it's just one of the, oh I can help him. You know, I've learned I'm the caretaker. Like I roll my eyes because it's like you can't change people that much, stupid. But it's weird because it was terrible. But, because he was real controlling and, you know, you start to doubt yourself. Like did I say that say that right and like he wouldn't let me sleep so then you start to lose that you know what I mean really you really do start to lose your mental 

Recording: (5092/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5093/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5094/ 9621) 
 I know, I am. I can't wait because the house we live in, it's a half double when we had a front porch and a deck, which I really decked out. I have like 80 plants in my house now, but I just can't wait to have my own space. I never plant anything in the ground there because I thought, well, I'm going to leave. 

Recording: (5095/ 9621) 
 This is one big one

 And it never goes back to the way it was before. You just know that there's someone that's completely dependent on you for everything. 

Recording: (5097/ 9621) 
 If she could have become the candidate, she might have been able to beat, I think almost anybody can beat Gore right now, but in election times, a weekend is a couple centuries, a year is an eon. So anything can happen between now and then, but I think Dole had a good chance of being elected because most Americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate, which is basically where Clinton placed himself in the two elections he ran in. Most real Democrats, the Warren Beatties of the world, and many congressmen and senators disliked Clinton because they didn't think he was democratic enough. I like Clinton because, as I said, over the years I've learned that extremes in either party don't get elected and that if you want someone that has your general interest at heart, you have to find someone who's a moderate and can appeal to everybody. I used to tell school districts when I went in to tell them how to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had the rule of 30s and that had nothing to do with my age, but that there was about 30% of the people who were for you, the yes votes, 30% who were automatically against you, the no votes, and 30% in between. I told them ignore the no votes. Just don't get them upset with you. You don't want them working actively against you. Lock up your 30 that are with you. Make sure you do something with them. But this group, the middle 30s I called them, you had to misogy them. And that's what Clinton did so well and that's what Dole could have done. I'm not sure if George W. is going to be able to because to get the nomination, eventually he's going to come out and have to make his hard statements to those people, which is I'm anti-abortion, I'm pro-gun. He's already said the pro-gun. And that's going against what most Americans are saying. Dole, I think, represented where most Americans are if you look at opinion polls. So, you know, you have to find a way to moderate that stance, whether you're Republican or a Democrat. 

Recording: (5098/ 9621) 
 Yeah, if I had stayed for the, I didn't graduate, so if I'd stayed for the fourth year, when we did a lot, would do a lot of making up a portfolio, that kind of thing, I probably, then I would have started going to interviews, and I probably would have stayed. But it was, 

Recording: (5099/ 9621) 
 Okay, so I can just talk normal and it won't be too loud, because I talk loud. 

Recording: (5100/ 9621)

 Oh ja. 

Recording: (5102/ 9621) 
 Uh huh, uh huh. 

Recording: (5103/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5104/ 9621) 
 So, and he 

Recording: (5105/ 9621) 
 that's how I would like it to be. 

Recording: (5106/ 9621) 
 There didn't used to be an especially in restaurants and everything and now it's such an open market and they know that they have to accommodate every Body's taste, you know, I mean before no, I'd have to go into a restaurant into salad baked potato, you know I mean there was nothing really nothing unless I go to a buffet and then all the food so cooked down I mean honestly, you know, it's like no nutritional value

Recording: (5108/ 9621) 
 I know one of the poisons used in it is rat poison or something like that. I mean, just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it's meant to kill a rat obviously seems pretty dangerous. 

Recording: (5109/ 9621) 
 All right. Very good. We're up here in the attic and the ink's freezing up on us. 

Recording: (5110/ 9621) 
 He has different levels of things that people need at different ages and things like that. At 40, you think, wow, you really need to make a difference or do something. And I can see that because I've gone through all the phases that he's talking about. 

Recording: (5111/ 9621) 
 drove me nuts. Say a few words for posterity, he'd say. And we'd say, get out of here. 

Recording: (5112/ 9621) 
 I'm out. 

Recording: (5113/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5114/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (5115/ 9621) 
 We like to cook. I do. I like to cook. I enjoy cooking. 

Recording: (5116/ 9621) 
 You know, what are you going to do? You hit that kid, you're going to jail. 

Recording: (5117/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5118/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5119/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think the population. In a way, but I think it also leaves it open for all the things of having too many people in one area. I don't know, I think the main thing that affects me now and since I've been home, I've been reading the paper a lot more and I'm more aware of what's going on and I really am gonna be some kind of activist for, I don't know, a lot of the places that are coming up, the gentleman's clubs and things like that. I think that's going to be really bad for the kids and everybody around. There's one off of Bethel, or no, it's off of Henderson, Cahoots, and then there's the Red Hot Peppers or something I saw the other day. I can't even believe they're like right across the street from each other. You know, and it's funny because you read the paper and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that, but then they let all that stuff, so I think it really affects it. Yeah, try to go around. And until they make a women's club, so it won't be real equal. 

Recording: (5120/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5121/ 9621) 
 but they're, because they're both government programs. But yeah, but I think, like I said, for the younger people, because it is, because it's not their fault their parents can't get health care, so. 

Recording: (5122/ 9621) 
 No, it happened quite a few times. And that, I mean, I also cheated on him too, you know, we both did it. But, um, once I had my son. 

Recording: (5123/ 9621) 
 So you have how many kids? 

Recording: (5124/ 9621) 
 We've been very happy with the OSU daycare. I don't know if you have any association with it, but oh, it's just unbelievable. Our daughter went there from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade. And I mean, when she got out of that daycare, she could read, she could write, she could do computer, you know. It's an education. It's not, you know, people, you pay for it. It's one of your hires, but higher amount of money for

 Once you're in it, you've been in it, and that's it. I have 32 points. 

Recording: (5126/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you're right. 

Recording: (5127/ 9621) 
 That's alright. Okay. 

Recording: (5128/ 9621) 
 It felt innocent to me and I like that because all the other times where they've started to kiss, it's always been like stereotypic romantic, da da da da da. And that's like, wow, two friends alone, it's New Year's, perfect. It wasn't like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that. 

Recording: (5129/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I mean, I guess for me, I just, Jason and I get along so well, you know, and we've been together for about two years. And I mean, I don't know. I just, I do. I just really like him. I don't know if I'll feel that way in ten years from now, but it certainly, there's a lot of things that our families are very similar. I mean, we have a lot of the same types of opinions about different things, and we communicate very well. And I think those are a lot of things you have to look at from the beginning. I know that I was in a relationship for about five years before I met him. And his name was Jason, too, but he drank a lot. 

Recording: (5130/ 9621) 
 That's true. Oh. 

Recording: (5131/ 9621) 
 Oh really? That's cute. 

Recording: (5132/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5133/ 9621) 
 I got a lot of respect for the college kids, the majority of them. It's other people I don't have respect for. 

Recording: (5134/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5135/ 9621) 
 and oh, she's snapping, she's pregnant back off. 

Recording: (5136/ 9621) 
 Oh no, and it turns out it was the faceless aliens set a trap for the guys. I didn't like the way it was resolved, but I liked the fact that it wasn't resolved the way that they set it up. So I think that, I mean, we supposedly know about Samantha. 

Recording: (5137/ 9621) 
 It is and it isn't because I see where he is and he's really messed up and I can't do anything for him. But I've you know I've I'm open to a relationship with him. 

Recording: (5138/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (5139/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5140/ 9621) 
 You walk in, and you're like, oh my gosh. Don't you know the fire around that, huh? 

Recording: (5141/ 9621) 
 Okay. Well, the reason I asked was, it seems to me a lot of the impetus for going to church or going back to church for people is when their kid gets old enough to go to Sunday school. Starting asking questions about religion and you're saying, well, I suppose I could answer all these, but yeah. 

Recording: (5142/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5143/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5144/ 9621) 
 Well, and I think it really still goes back to the mom and the dad and what the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy. You know, would I act this way? Would that make my mom and dad? Because until you're about five or four, your parents are pretty important to you and what they think. So that's when, you know, you have to instill that stuff. You have to, you know, and they learn by watching you do it, too. I mean, my son, now, I saw him when, let's see, he was 15, maybe. He'd run across the street when Martha, the 86-year-old lady across the street, was trying to bring her garbage down. He'd seen me do that. He'd go, oh, let me get that for you, Martha. She's got arthritis. She looks like she's gonna fall she takes steps about this big and I've seen him do that 

Recording: (5145/ 9621) 
 You know with limited money and I live in a nice neighborhood. I've lived there for 11 years. I've never had any trouble whatsoever and the bus is right there. You know the only thing that bothers me is if I want to you know go to a grocery store I got to go over to High Street you know to Clinton Ville you know to the Big Bear. 

Recording: (5146/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you always still gonna have violence. Like when we were kids, like me and you would meet, we'd get in a fight, and then after that we'd be best friends. Now, you know, I'd be walking down the street and a 14-year-old would scare me to death right now. 

Recording: (5147/ 9621) 
 Before we used to have a system that only people in the back room of the libraries connected to and it was all mainframe and then people got PCs on their desk and suddenly the whole world of who could access any system and what they could do on their desk changed. And now we've gone more out into the public, what can the public see and do. It's not just for the people in the back room. And then the web, you know, people, anybody anywhere can connect. We only worked with libraries before. Now we're trying to figure out how do we deal with anybody who just wants to connect to us. 

Recording: (5148/ 9621) 
 I was actually looking at that riser military and they started popping up all this abuse stuff and I was like man darn it. 

Recording: (5149/ 9621) 
 Yeah, over the years we've had situations like that, you know, a pregnancy here and there, things that people needed to get worked out, or someone being worried about a neighbor being abused, a child being abused, and not knowing what to do about it. So yeah, but you know, I'm just lucky. I'm so lucky. 

Recording: (5150/ 9621) 
 I'll also spend you. 

Recording: (5151/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5152/ 9621) 
 I started at the real bottom of it. 

Recording: (5153/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that. 

Recording: (5154/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I had a little gymnasium in it. 

Recording: (5155/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (5156/ 9621) 
 So southern Russia, it's near Kazakhstan. I mean, not really near, but relatively. It's not close to Moscow. 

Recording: (5157/ 9621) 
 She did, but we were out. 

Recording: (5158/ 9621) 
 Aerospace industry. My dad had a degree in engineering. What kind of engineering? Drafting engineering, I think. And worked for in California and they asked him to move to the North American plant here in Columbus out near the airport when it was North American before it became Rockwell. And that's why we moved here and that's why I grew up on the east side because it was close to there. And when I was one year old, we took a car trip across the country. I don't remember much of it but that's how we moved. 

Recording: (5159/ 9621) 
 So now I am independent without family in Columbus. 

Recording: (5160/ 9621) 
 Wait, even though it's an inanimate object, it all kinda came together. 

Recording: (5161/ 9621) 
 So right there, you're over me. 

Recording: (5162/ 9621) 
 And so I give her most credit for.

 Drink around the world. Oh boy. 

Recording: (5164/ 9621) 
 Saturday 

Recording: (5165/ 9621) 
 Not so much when I was teaching it, because I think 

Recording: (5166/ 9621) 
 And I wouldn't be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here. 

Recording: (5167/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5168/ 9621) 
 can get aggravating. And when you get to be older, you know, some of those issues can be very aggravating. 

Recording: (5169/ 9621) 
 Because they have enough money to buy new things and they don't want to necessarily send it down, I don't think, to the Salvation Army. I think that they think that there's a better way of giving away and like Goodwill, they resell and Salvation Army, they resell. 

Recording: (5170/ 9621) 
 Um, no, which is I'm very grateful. He did like go past my parents house and things like that. But then they moved here. And even though it's public records, like who owns a house. Luckily, we haven't had that because we purchased the house, my husband and I, before we were married and then moved in after we were married. So the deed has my maiden name on it. But no, luckily. 

Recording: (5171/ 9621) 
 Please. 

Recording: (5172/ 9621) 
 Great. 

Recording: (5173/ 9621) 
 I'm the one that's eventually going to get in trouble. 

Recording: (5174/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (5175/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5176/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (5177/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5178/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I think I'm a firm believer that little subtleties like that to yourself are much better than looking in the mirror and going, look at them hips. And you go this way and you go, I'm getting a gut. And you know, it's like, that's so negative to yourself. Would you tell your mom that? 

Recording: (5179/ 9621) 
 Well, we believe that that revelation that was there on earth was actually restored again through Joseph Smith because he had a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed and he actually had a vision where he saw God and Jesus Christ. And I know this is all really, I mean, this is like deep doctrine stuff, but, and he was told that there were none of the churches on the earth were true, that some of them had good things, but they weren't exactly hitting the mark. 

Recording: (5180/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (5181/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5182/ 9621) 
 No, the daughter's already taking golf lessons. 

Recording: (5183/ 9621) 
 She pulls up, she goes, are you nuts? What are you doing? I said, I'm sorry, am I walking too far out in the road? And she goes, no, you're walking in the middle of a tornado. I looked at her and said, what? 

Recording: (5184/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5185/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I guess. I just have the nerve to scratch and stuff. Like, my rings, I'll twist them because they bother me. Like, I don't wear this all a lot. It's one of the days I did. 

Recording: (5186/ 9621) 
 You know, every time they ask him a question, it's like it's been scripted and it's over and over and he doesn't seem like he's real bright. 

Recording: (5187/ 9621) 
 Nah. 

Recording: (5188/ 9621) 
 I do. 

Recording: (5189/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (5190/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's what they suggest doing is two years of med school, get your PhD, and then do your last two years of med school. 

Recording: (5191/ 9621) 
 So we walked across the street to the church. 

Recording: (5192/ 9621) 
 above it, and periodically they would have to clean those out because the fan would draw, in addition to fumes, they would draw some lint off of this stuff. So he was up on top of one of these rollers, cleaning out the hood with supposedly non-flammable solvent. 

Recording: (5193/ 9621) 
 I've well, that's a that's a tough one. I Remember when you know when we were we had you know, some movies like that, but they were like the Bowery boys and stuff, you know, we're You pretty much knew it was all fake anyway, you know, but and to me that's fake And I never really thought about while I was growing up that it was what was real and everything I always knew that by I dare again, you know by my dad being a hunter and everything You know, I knew that when you shot something that died it wouldn't it wasn't a game, you know And I'd hate to think that that would Cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody else. Shoot another human being, I mean, that doesn't... I don't even know why there should be any concern for it, I guess, on one side. 

Recording: (5194/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (5195/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't think that women should be on the front lines. Some women are physically able to do what's needed. Some definitely aren't. Of course, by the same token, some men aren't. But as support groups, I think that's all right. 

Recording: (5196/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, he 

Recording: (5197/ 9621) 
 She's very bright. She's very she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her parents divorced when she was about four Her mother's an alcoholic her father said he would take her With him and then after he got divorced he changed his mind. So she's pretty much raised herself It's a big it's terrible things what she's had to go through and she's made it very clear that she will not live with an alcoholic and that that's helped straighten him out some. And our feeling was never that the alcoholism or the drugs was not the problem. And we've dealt with several counselors and that's all they wanted to deal with. Our problem has always been it's a symptom. Took the psychologist a year and a half, but he finally agreed. Charlie, he's very intuitive. And even as a toddler, he could do this. He seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him. 

Recording: (5198/ 9621) 
 That was real close to my home. 

Recording: (5199/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5200/ 9621) 
 but he'd bring in a nutritionalist or whatever to explain to the parents blah blah blah 

Recording: (5201/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5202/ 9621) 
 Okay, so it's just like an independent contractor for them. 

Recording: (5203/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5204/ 9621) 
 I think through education, it's just going to only help kids because a lot of times maybe they don't get that at home. So they're really looking to choose the right thing to do. 

Recording: (5205/ 9621) 
 Yeah, oh my, uh, I'm in this, uh, venturing crew, which is through Boy Scouts. Our leader has this, like, society totally planned out.

 crime and stuff. I mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the Republican years and carried over. But people have been better off financially overall. And I don't think he's made any major, I wouldn't say he's made any major mistakes. Policy-wise, well yes. His personal life, he's made major mistakes. Policy-wise? Well, yes. His personal life, just, he's, well, yeah. 

Recording: (5209/ 9621) 
 I mean it goes back more towards the curious nature of kids where I mean I can't say there's anything really different. 

Recording: (5210/ 9621) 
 No, that's... 

Recording: (5211/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (5212/ 9621) 
 I mean that's not to say that I don't like being Catholic or whatever. 

Recording: (5213/ 9621) 
 It's just there we go again who's right who's wrong I have no idea 

Recording: (5214/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (5215/ 9621) 
 But you had to work. You had to migrate. They started splitting the family up by saying, sir, if you want a job, we're expanding to Los Angeles. So they split the family up. 

Recording: (5216/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think so. I think in high school there was, or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school. Because there were pregnant girls in my high school. 

Recording: (5217/ 9621) 
 Oh my goodness. 

Recording: (5218/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's pretty much out there. 

Recording: (5219/ 9621) 
 Mmm, yeah, give some charity and keep care of your bills and probably go on that vacation you've been dying for. Like you're making my brain water here over Australia. 

Recording: (5220/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5221/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (5222/ 9621) 
 it's like a mail-order catalog thing and uh... so uh... people are really really incompetent it's really funny like for some people uh... i don't know how they had uh... even some people who can speak english even one of our know how they got signed up for how they even have a credit card order and two you can tell especially when because people call from all over it's really funny to talk to people from alab South Carolina I can never knew people from South Carolina had such thick accents. I never really thought of North Carolina and South Carolina being Really southern even though I mean they seceded first, you know, I mean I just just that's different I always thought that more being East Coast as opposed to so southern and man, there's people people there who I can't even understand what they're saying. And especially too how it's all like you have to give numbers and model numbers and stuff and type it in real fast. And people go unbelievably fast when they say like a 10-string number and then they get mad at you and like you can't type it in fast enough. Like if they just said it slow once, it would save time. And just how to, how 3D8A and a bunch of numbers all sound the same, like DB38A all sound the same. And people, you know, like A is an apple and they're like, apple, what? What are you talking about? Something like that. Like, for real weird. And just how, they're like, where's my membership membership number and they can't find it and you're like all right all right look on the catalog where it says MEM number that's that would be your membership number and people are like all right all right but I don't know like I really don't I really want to get a job that's like in a warehouse or something something real easy where I can just like load boxes or something because I never have time to really I Mean like I try and do like can I try and do yoga, but it's like we work to 3211 so it's like by the time you get home it's like you just want to sit and like not do anything and like You know working out is hard and stuff because you don't have time so I want to have a job where if I don't have time at the end of the day to work out, it's like I'm working out sort of during my job. And I really hate talking on the phone now. Having jobs for a while where I talk on the phone makes me just not want to talk on the phone at all at home. Or too, when I'm on the phone at home, then it brings weird flash flashbacks to work So it's like I'll start like talking like I'm at work, you know, so it's like like the phone like 

Recording: (5223/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my dad's a chauvinist pig. But that's... He still is. 

Recording: (5224/ 9621) 
 But SISNY is pretty much accessible. 

Recording: (5225/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, I asked the Germans what stereotypes are prevalent in Germany of Americans, and they said, you know, Americans are cowboys and eat at McDonald's three meals a day. 

Recording: (5226/ 9621) 
 I don't intend to ever leave here, so... 

Recording: (5227/ 9621) 
 But I imagine your sibling has a similar worldview, perhaps twisted in some. 

Recording: (5228/ 9621) 
 Because I mean, I've got a lot, I've loved this man to death. It's like, and that might be something that was, is holding me back from dating, but you know, it'll eventually go away, hopefully. But yeah, I'd warn her. I don't care if he's, he looks like the perfect guy. Cause yeah, I think he looks like he's a very nice guy and you know, he just doesn't know how to stick with one woman, I don't think. Yeah. 

Recording: (5229/ 9621) 
 No? 

Recording: (5230/ 9621) 
 how to step by step of how to commit suicide. Yeah, they have to be responsible I think. Because you know you put an idea into somebody's head and then when you give them the resources to carry those things out. I think it has to be responsible for a lot of it. 

Recording: (5231/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5232/ 9621) 
 And I think that sometimes they don't even count all the votes or something and sometimes if they really wanted to go through bad enough, even though the majority voted not for it, I mean, even though the majority doesn't want that to happen, that somehow or other they'll count it so it did or they'll, you know. 

Recording: (5233/ 9621) 
 If you just look at the nature of what they're doing, it's just... 

Recording: (5234/ 9621) 
 I don't know if they still do. That was a long time ago. That's always kind of been known for that, you know. 

Recording: (5235/ 9621) 
 the part. Now it takes about 50 minutes, but to do all this stretching. 

Recording: (5236/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (5237/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (5238/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5239/ 9621) 
 I was just listening to music and I got a little sidetracked from this tree across the way. It got destroyed by lightning. I looked across and it started raining and the wind was a little heavy. It was rocking me back and forth like this. I got up all the way and looked around and said, what the hell is going on here? I turned on the radio and they said something about a thunderstorm coming through and it will be gone by 20 minutes or something. This truck felt like it was going to tip over. I got out of there real fast and started walking down towards, it's probably about a good 20 mile walk to where the nearest 24 hour house of pancakes is. You ever been down there? The IHOP? 

Recording: (5240/ 9621) 
 because they feel they have the need for it. There's so many golfers. I mean, that sports went sky high. I mean, my mom used to play golf growing up, and they only let them on the golf courses one day a week, which is amazing. It was like on a Tuesday. And when I lived in Florida, a lot of the courses were like that, too. And I thought, they're only allowing women one day a week? Isn't that amazing? There's so many good women golfers now. But they said they're too slow, slow and they always talk and that just killed me. Well, my mom, that's the only day she could play and she wanted to play more. 

Recording: (5241/ 9621) 
 That's one of the things we looked when we were shopping for homes was we were shopping for school systems just as much you know so And I don't want to buy a house And I don't want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system so because it seems like since we've bought our house the houses are just Doubling and tripling in value. It's unbelievable. Yeah, I don't know ours has increased quite a lot since we've been there, but we've been there I guess about 10 years. We rented in Grandview. 

Recording: (5242/ 9621) 
 I've been in the same house for 17 years. 

Recording: (5243/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5244/ 9621) 
 No, we actually had student tickets that people didn't want clear up on C deck, but we enjoy it because a lot of times we walk. 

Recording: (5245/ 9621) 
 That would be seriously fun. But it depends. If you work industry, you get money. 

Recording: (5246/ 9621) 
 you know. 

Recording: (5247/ 9621) 
 and the changes in Inman is like a lot. It's got robbed a lot more. Because my grandfather kept a shotgun underneath the counter. Easton, Easton is crazy. 

Recording: (5248/ 9621) 
 yeah like it and like sort of and it was like mp3s and stuff and people do a lot of that it's it's uh... i don't really know how to handle that much like 

Recording: (5249/ 9621) 
 It's like, you know, yeah, like a hundred hours a window in one week. Oh, man. 

Recording: (5250/ 9621) 
 So I haven't been able to eat that, but luckily my husband, he's allergic too. 

Recording: (5251/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (5252/ 9621) 
 Lived in Columbus all my life. My dad's dead. He's been dead for about 25 years. My mom's still alive. She's not in real good health. My wife moved from Columbus to Arizona, and then she moved back here and we got married. Like I said, I grew up here. I used to hunt. Fact is, you know, we're Henderson, Olentangy, and Bethel Road. I used to hunt all up in through there. 

Recording: (5253/ 9621) 
 Yeah. But it's like, I mean, there's these stories almost every day you hear them. And that's, I mean, that's even a big change from five or 10 years ago. 

Recording: (5254/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5255/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah. 

Recording: (5256/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (5257/ 9621) 
 I got lots of stories I could tell about Columbus but I think your hour is almost up. Sorry. 

Recording: (5258/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly, in the middle of the afternoon, yeah. 

Recording: (5259/ 9621) 
 He's got this thing like 30% sales tax and no other tax at all. 

Recording: (5260/ 9621) 
 No, I gave him a different middle name. 

Recording: (5261/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5262/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's true and she likes it, she's really good at it and drives my stepdad crazy because she'll always be like, hey Pete can you come over and put these cabinets in? And he's like, I don't want to do anything else. 

Recording: (5263/ 9621) 
 I think it's been good. I mean, the economy has been very good. It seems like society seems to be improving, even though we talked about this. 

Recording: (5264/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5265/ 9621) 
 OK. So he got expelled from Catholic school for behavior problems. 

Recording: (5266/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5267/ 9621) 
 There are 15. 

Recording: (5268/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5269/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah, she's 19. Yeah. 

Recording: (5270/ 9621) 
 Picket bodies. 

Recording: (5271/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (5272/ 9621) 
 That's a good way. 

Recording: (5273/ 9621) 
 She works in a school building and she hears all the troubles. 

Recording: (5274/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5275/ 9621) 
 Yeah. And that's the thing about the schools too. I totally disagree with uniforms. Unless it's all slacks, all of it. Because you get the girls in the uniforms and they're short and they can't enforce that. They don't enforce that. And the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the girls up in the front row, I should have went and met him. Or I should have said, hey, you know, he haven't met me. And I really fault myself for that. But it's made me more aware, too. And when you look at somebody and say, oh, you would never dream that they, well, I do. There isn't anything I don't put past anybody doing. I really don't. Because they just, yeah. Oh, no I do because there's some good ones out there and there's some bad ones too. But you know. 

Recording: (5276/ 9621) 
 three years. 

Recording: (5277/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (5278/ 9621) 
 oh yeah, they showed they cut open, pulling this baby out of this little hole in this lady's stomach and I just, I had heart surgery when I was younger and so I've had lots of needles and those types of things and when it comes to needles and that kind of stuff, I'm just kind of squeamish about it, you know, so that stuff I just, I just don't want to see it. 

Recording: (5279/ 9621) 
 But I mean I honestly do think I'd at least go to church on occasion if it wasn't forced on me. I mean it just got sort of just to the point of being ridiculous going 17, 18 years every single week. 

Recording: (5280/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't know like stereos, TVs, washers, dryers, like weird things too, like as seen on TV things, you know. 

Recording: (5281/ 9621) 
 How many I don't know it doesn't matter been in many ones that were too hard for me 

Recording: (5282/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5283/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (5284/ 9621) 
 baseball, like I collected baseball cards. I lived in Detroit and so that's why it like stuck with me. So like I remember I had my tonsils out in third grade like you're allowed to bring one item because like you're a little kid. It's like make you feel better and I brought my Detroit Tigers hat so like and like I only wear Detroit or Boston and Boston just because I was born there. But and like people make fun of me they're like you know because Detroit's horrible. They're in last place. 

Recording: (5285/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5286/ 9621) 
 Yeah, probably have to go to Dublin or Worthington, somewhere around there to find a couple millionaires. 

Recording: (5287/ 9621) 
 Have a good one. 

Recording: (5288/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think they're two-faced. 

Recording: (5289/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you really do. Yeah. 

Recording: (5290/ 9621) 
 No, no, they take the money whether you're in it or not. You have no choice. You have a choice as to whether you're a lot of money, but you got some strike pay and this and that but it wasn't a lot, you know $200 a week isn't much at all. So and when you have a family, I mean $200 a week doesn't pay my daycare bill. So So it's gonna be tight for our family for a few months, you know to get back on track 

Recording: (5291/ 9621) 
 날씨였습니다. 

Recording: (5292/ 9621) 
 And they stopped doing that now. 

Recording: (5293/ 9621) 
 I doubt it 

Recording: (5294/ 9621) 
 Oh wow. 

Recording: (5295/ 9621) 
 right with the human rights. 

Recording: (5296/ 9621) 
 That's why I don't get to. 

Recording: (5297/ 9621) 
 You can get in huge arguments. People are like, no, you're lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died, you would want them dead. And honestly, I can honestly say I would not want that to happen to them. 

Recording: (5298/ 9621) 
 to diversity. 

Recording: (5299/ 9621) 
 49 I've been here since 72 actually I'm actually from Athens, but I was in the service there for about six older and kind of felt an obligation to be around them to help take care of them and stuff. 

Recording: (5300/ 9621) 
 bright. 

Recording: (5301/ 9621) 
 everything you do right. 

Recording: (5302/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (5303/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is warm in here. 

Recording: (5304/ 9621) 
 Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, I liked it a lot. But it was 1970 and there was Kent State and there was all that stuff going on and school just didn't seem that important. And also I think this happens to a lot of people as they approach senior year. Oh my God, I'm gonna graduate and then I'm gonna have to be a grownup. Okay, I won't graduate. 

Recording: (5305/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5306/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5307/ 9621) 
 Oh, every day, every day there was something. It's like, I felt like I knew more about Clinton's sex life than I knew about my own. And it was far more than I wanted to know about anybody else's. Whereas, you know, in the past there's been presidents who had a fear the press never acknowledged it even if they knew it. At least that's what, you know, 

Recording: (5308/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5309/ 9621) 
 The government's always good for money. 

Recording: (5310/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (5311/ 9621) 
 Right, you know, because every businessman goes, I want to be there at, you know, and it doesn't work that way. You know, you can't, you just can't physically do it. 

Recording: (5312/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean. 

Recording: (5313/ 9621) 
 or they use the Bible to say, well, you know, God specifically says in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity. Well, who do you think wrote that? You know? 

Recording: (5314/ 9621) 
 And it was fun. I met a lot of neat people. In fact, that's where I met the woman whose child I took care of. She was one of the artists who came to me. But nobody was going to make any money on it. And it was the kind of thing that it was a project. I started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because I needed a new project. And I didn't know anything about it. I'd never even been in a gallery. I thought, this will be fun. I'll just rent this space. Because I found this space, and I was trying to think of something I could do with it. So I thought, well, I'll rent this space, and then I know what I'll do. I'll just put it out on the paper, and I'll find a bunch of artists, and then I'll set this business up. And it was consignment, so I didn't need that money. I just needed rent, and we had art classes, and that was fun. And so once I got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go,'s not nearly as interesting once you know you I like I like to make it happen I'm not really interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come in and so When the lease was up on High Street I was gonna get rid of it and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said could we please you know would you consider having some partners and I said sure if you guys are willing to come and sit in this place, then I'll have to come and sit here. So we moved to Grandview, and it was doing much better over there. And then the same thing happened. The attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space, and when our lease was up, they had more money than we did. So we were going to have to move again, and I just said, this is not worth it. And it and besides that I was ready that was about three or four years into it I was ready to do something else and I had already started taking care of Jesse then so I used to take him down to the gallery with me I had a little bassinet in the back and people say is that a baby? 

Recording: (5315/ 9621) 
 It's open 24 hours, so there's people that, you know, it's like shifts overlap, you know, it's not like everybody leaves and then everybody comes in, you know. It's like, like when we're there, like the night shift people start to come in, people who work from like 8 to 4, 8 p.m. to 4 a.m., and that'd be really weird. I guess like nobody calls then or something, like 10 people call, so she's like, it's so easy, she's like, I get paid to, 

Recording: (5316/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5317/ 9621) 
 I didn't know what the problem was and I just kept having these problems with him. So they told me I needed to take him to the school, said I needed to take him to a psychiatrist, psychologist. So I took him and she said, do you think this is normal? Because he's like rolling off the chair and banging dolls together. I said, I don't know. I said, I got one brother. I don't know how boys are supposed to be. She said, well, this is not normal. Okay. So I don't know. I tried taking him to psychologists. They did like behavior therapy. I brought him here to Ohio State and put him in an experiment. He was in it for about three years, working with a food supplement. And it actually did real well for him. And the researcher gave me what he, you know, it's like sort of like taking vitamins. He gave me supplies of that even after the project was over. But then after there wasn't any more, he couldn't give it to me and it cost too much for me to buy it. 

Recording: (5318/ 9621) 
 Is it hard to keep up with her? 

Recording: (5319/ 9621) 
 Ah, they seem to. 

Recording: (5320/ 9621) 
 If you gotta pull tape over down the hall, I'll show you. It's kinda... 

Recording: (5321/ 9621) 
 in a hole and I was still shaking. But I don't remember, I think they put one of our guns out of commission that time, but they didn't do as much damage as they might have. 

Recording: (5322/ 9621) 
 Okay, one, two, three, four, five. Testing, testing. When I was a kid, my father got this tape recorder. In the days when they were those big, you know, the wheels 

Recording: (5323/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'd be so frustrated. I probably, oh, I would be really. 

Recording: (5324/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (5325/ 9621) 
 leave it alone for hours like I did this morning, but yeah. 

Recording: (5326/ 9621) 
 28 years. This is my 28th year. I have two more years to go and I get to retire and then I'll go retrain and probably do something else for another 20 years. 

Recording: (5327/ 9621) 
 I can't see it. 

Recording: (5328/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5329/ 9621) 
 I worked downtown. The last year I worked downtown and then I think about oh probably 15-20 years ago I worked downtown. And you know as far as the focus you mean like night time things or just anything in general? 

Recording: (5330/ 9621) 
 That's good. 

Recording: (5331/ 9621) 
 I would have a hard time believing that. I mean if the person knew, I would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and that was important to them and they prayed and 

Recording: (5332/ 9621) 
 I feel that the past season, the past two seasons really, haven't been as strong as the earlier seasons. And so in some ways I'm not as upset about the X-Files completing its run as I have been about other shows. I mean, it's also the Simpsons final season I've heard. 

Recording: (5333/ 9621) 
 I might be wrong because my answer wouldn't be that good on that question. No offense, but you know what I mean. 

Recording: (5334/ 9621) 
 The things that I notice that are different. I guess, I mean, if you look like as far as expansion, obviously there's a lot of areas that are developed now that didn't used to be. 

Recording: (5335/ 9621) 
 I was ready to settle down. I wasn't going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that. And lie and cheat and make up stories and he still does it. And I don't understand why. I feel like he's a grown man. If he was out, don't make up a story. And his mother also makes, it's very stressful for me. And that's another reason why I don't want my son going there for much longer but his dad pays her for the babysitting because I can't afford it. 

Recording: (5336/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, then they won't want to go anywhere with you. Anyways, it's probably a pipe dream. 

Recording: (5337/ 9621) 
 Mhm. Right. 

Recording: (5338/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't think he exaggerated, but he was selective about the people that he 

Recording: (5339/ 9621) 
 And the first episode, the first half was excellent. It had the cigarette smoking man, it was from his perspective, he was talking about it. And then the second half got like... 

Recording: (5340/ 9621) 
 And to look at him and go, oh, my water broke. Oh, no. And watch him flip out, like on movies. But we didn't get to do that. 

Recording: (5341/ 9621) 
 And most of the time they were putting them in charge. Well, like we get, no offense, we get these college students coming out that were second lieutenants that thought they'd know everything. 

Recording: (5342/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5343/ 9621) 
 I forgot you guys have like a big kangaroo population. You know, like Ohio has like all these deer and stuff. So it's like they have 

Recording: (5344/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because it's all continuously mixed. It's not real. I like it how the rave scene is kind of faceless because it's not more rock star oriented and stuff. It's more a serious type thing, but not so glam and fame oriented and stuff. 

Recording: (5345/ 9621) 
 His, my boyfriend's aunt and uncle, their kid has that really hyperness. 

Recording: (5346/ 9621) 
 You know, like if our system would shut down, it would cost us, I don't remember what it is, you know, tens of thousands of dollars for every hour that we're down. If our database would be trashed, our main database would be trashed, we'd have real serious problems and it could take weeks or months to rebuild it. Yeah, so it could be a problem. We've got people working in that area. 

Recording: (5347/ 9621) 
 You're still here? 

Recording: (5348/ 9621) 
 I like seeing them grow up together. 

Recording: (5349/ 9621) 
 Which reminds me. 

Recording: (5350/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5351/ 9621) 
 was five. 

Recording: (5352/ 9621) 
 winter of 91. And I went to Columbus State and I had just, there was a few years that I didn't go here and then so I came back. So all together I don't know how many years it's been but. 

Recording: (5353/ 9621) 
 a small one, and I don't know whether it was there when we moved there or not. But anyway, it was a fairly good size, I mean, probably half a mile long. And out in the middle of it, there was an island. 

Recording: (5354/ 9621) 
 You 

Recording: (5355/ 9621) 
 You know, like work hard when you have to. 

Recording: (5356/ 9621) 
 You know, you got two adults in your house, it doesn't matter what gender they are. 

Recording: (5357/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (5358/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's kind of fun. 

Recording: (5359/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5360/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5361/ 9621) 
 Really? They are the biggest assholes. 

Recording: (5362/ 9621) 
 and the others were sort of good. 

Recording: (5363/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we're going to have to give it up by Friday. Because the strike's over. They won't let us keep it anymore. 

Recording: (5364/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5365/ 9621) 
 아쉽다 

Recording: (5366/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (5367/ 9621) 
 I'm not built that way. 

Recording: (5368/ 9621) 
 Oh, there's a lot of racism. 

Recording: (5369/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5370/ 9621) 
 You know, okay, this is what I'm doing wrong. Let's not do it again. And then nobody asked me out for a few more years. 

Recording: (5371/ 9621) 
 Well, the furniture, the dining room sets, the chairs, the couches. 

Recording: (5372/ 9621) 
 Oh, no. 

Recording: (5373/ 9621) 
 They're gonna come and ask you something no matter what you say. 

Recording: (5374/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (5375/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (5376/ 9621) 
 And it was very hard for some of the younger people and students to get up there because of transportation. 

Recording: (5377/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (5378/ 9621) 
 So you knew, you've heard about that probably. 

Recording: (5379/ 9621) 
 And you're not being recorded now. 

Recording: (5380/ 9621) 
 I never thought about that. 

Recording: (5381/ 9621) 
 I mean... 

Recording: (5382/ 9621) 
 professionalism as well. 

Recording: (5383/ 9621) 
 I play with computers. Normally when people ask me, I tell them what I did that day or what I did the day before if they ask me in the evening. So what did I do today? What did I do today? Internet Information Server is a product by Microsoft. It lets you house web pages and put them out on the web. IndexServe is another product that lets you put search engines on that. Then there's another product by a company called SplitCycle. It's called NetStock. It sucks. NetStock basically goes out to Yahoo and checks to see what the stock prices on something are. And so I made NetStock, IIS, and Index server all play nicely together today. 

Recording: (5384/ 9621) 
 That's it. 

Recording: (5385/ 9621) 
 that it shouldn't be. On the other hand, I'd hate to see a 13-year-old have a baby because she was afraid 

Recording: (5386/ 9621) 
 So we... 

Recording: (5387/ 9621) 
 I hear some of that from Gor, but not as much. 

Recording: (5388/ 9621) 
 It's a cartoon, I believe it started out. 

Recording: (5389/ 9621) 
 Oh, there was a lot of discouraging things. I mean, I learned so much. And it wasn't always just people rejecting you that was discouraging, because that was kind of funny at times. 

Recording: (5390/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (5391/ 9621) 
 There were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it. 

Recording: (5392/ 9621) 
 against him in a lot of ways. 

Recording: (5393/ 9621) 
 of the times and memories and stuff. 

Recording: (5394/ 9621) 
 And that's where the Ohio State players, I don't know if you know this, they stay there every night before a game. I mean, it's the most expensive hotel in Columbus. All the players stay there, but to my amazement, they come down for a, I think they have a dinner, then they come down for a midnight snack. It's so funny how these guys come down in their shorts and stuff. 

Recording: (5395/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5396/ 9621) 
 I think that's kind of nice. 

Recording: (5397/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (5398/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5399/ 9621) 
 Raised to love and 

Recording: (5400/ 9621) 
 Just like... 

Recording: (5401/ 9621) 
 about two and a half years ago. 

Recording: (5402/ 9621) 
 Ha! 

Recording: (5403/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5404/ 9621) 
 in a heartbeat try and help them. But I don't think they make an effort to put out any, you know, 

Recording: (5405/ 9621) 
 The majority of the ones that don't get the guidance at home that you're trying to reach ain't gonna go to Boy Scouts. 

Recording: (5406/ 9621) 
 They have a very nice standard of living, all of them do. 

Recording: (5407/ 9621) 
 and so they offered to move them back. 

Recording: (5408/ 9621) 
 People like that can't work. When I was a kid, your family took care of you. There wasn't welfare and stuff like this. But you don't have a family structure no more. 

Recording: (5409/ 9621) 
 A parakeet, yes. A little two and a half, three ounce ball of fluff. 

Recording: (5410/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5411/ 9621) 
 and then I'll start running this campaign. Then I'll kind of read up on it, but I haven't really. 

Recording: (5412/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, and that's normal, we understood that. We knew a lot of stuff. We raised him to be very independent. And I always said that we're gonna regret this someday. I said another 10 years we'll be pleased, but we were not particularly raised either of us, my wife or I, to be very independent. So I guess the point that when we were first married, it was hard to make a simple decision on anything You know, we've worked through that after 25 years, but Or to stand on our own or anything, but you know, we learned to do it but we always he was always very independent his teacher said independently said stubborn, but It's like even go to McDonald's or something and he was didn't want onions on anything he if he ordered a Happy meal without onions and they put onions on it He would go up to the counter even as six and seven years old and tell him 

Recording: (5413/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5414/ 9621) 
 Oh my gosh, they just... 

Recording: (5415/ 9621) 
 Nope, I met him through a friend. I met him through his brother was dating my best friend. 

Recording: (5416/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he's really good. 

Recording: (5417/ 9621) 
 I think it would. 

Recording: (5418/ 9621) 
 Yes, and that's what I like. 

Recording: (5419/ 9621) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (5420/ 9621) 
 hit the mark sometimes so he gets to clean the toilet especially since most of that is his. 

Recording: (5421/ 9621) 
 Anything else is a hardware failure and you'd have to go fix it somewhere else anyway. So if you know how to put an operating system on your machine, you can start over. If you can start over, there's no reason to be scared of anything that you do. Problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they're going to break something. 

Recording: (5422/ 9621) 
 Well, believe me, I know. 

Recording: (5423/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for a long time, which I'm sure she did. I don't know. I always thought it would be neat to have a system like the police have. If you don't pay a speeding ticket, there's a warrant for your arrest, and they come after you. 

Recording: (5424/ 9621) 
 like Catholic, oh, for Mormons? Well, our basic, real fundamental belief is that the church that the Russians believed in at one time was the true church and that it was the same church that Christ set up when he was on the earth with the 12 apostles. But after Christ died, that the authority was taken from the earth to have those apostles and to have the church set up like it was. And it must have been really strong because it still lasted all the same. Catholic and all the Orthodox churches still carried all these beliefs. 

Recording: (5425/ 9621) 
 No children, so it was quite easy for us. 

Recording: (5426/ 9621) 
 Yeah, not for special conditions, nothing. Just universally, it's wrong. 

Recording: (5427/ 9621) 
 I would do it in a minute, but my family doesn't want it. My husband thinks we're fine. He doesn't want any more around. And all my kids are so used to all their own. 

Recording: (5428/ 9621) 
 And until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the market, it's always gonna be inequitable and you're gonna have a problem in our society because we don't need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age, it becomes a liability. But then the developers are like, well, let's see, we can make condos, downsize a little bit, but still we wanna make this margin of profit. Yeah, we do, but what about for society's best interests? 

Recording: (5429/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's true. That's a pretty good analogy. 

Recording: (5430/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5431/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5432/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. But see, I've always, I have one floors where I live now, I vacuum them. I mean, I'm just the type, you know, I didn't want pet hair and 

Recording: (5433/ 9621) 
 But yeah, I am disciplined. She's not as strict as I am. 

Recording: (5434/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I don't know. I'm sure it would happen because there's all kinds of wacky people out there. Seriously. I don't know. I have family members that are homosexual. That's just my own personal thing. Beliefs. I don't know. I think that's they shouldn't have taken it off of the DMS whatever it was. I don't know. 

Recording: (5435/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you follow the script. That's real funny too. They listen to you, they monitor the calls, and they listen to you. And it's like this sheet, if you asked for the specials, and if you said it in this way, and if you used this or whatever. I don't know, it's just real weird. 

Recording: (5436/ 9621) 
 Oh, I know! It's so much fun! 

Recording: (5437/ 9621) 
 Aw. 

Recording: (5438/ 9621) 
 It's just like the people you see go to church. I walk out of church and see somebody sitting there that's homeless. 

Recording: (5439/ 9621) 
 Gay people are straight people, so. 

Recording: (5440/ 9621) 
 Yeah, when I first went to Oberlin, I was a performance major in French horn. And looking back on it, I wish I had maybe thought to major in music education, or at least have a little bit of background in that, because I'm thinking it would have given me a little more dimension in terms of my teaching possibilities. And although I'm certified to teach now in chemistry and earth science, it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also. 

Recording: (5441/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5442/ 9621) 
 Right, yeah. 

Recording: (5443/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. I just got done doing some roofing and I was supposed to meet my girlfriend out there She never did show up. So I had to walk from incredible. We're incredible universities to be will just say Hilliard and 270 all the way back this way on campus without water. Oh Man talk about being stuck in a desert 

Recording: (5444/ 9621) 
 just a home. I just have a tape that I use. It's Kathy Smith, one of her things that I really like. 

Recording: (5445/ 9621) 
 I answered it right. 

Recording: (5446/ 9621) 
 person on she's pretty high up I guess I was unaware 

Recording: (5447/ 9621) 
 but I managed to get that much information out. So the other cop goes upstairs and Chris's interpretation of the story at this point is, one moment I'm cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment I turn around and there's a large police officer in the doorway of your room. He said, hi. He said, I think you should come downstairs. They don't tell Chris anything. So Chris comes downstairs and he stands beside me. 

Recording: (5448/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5449/ 9621) 
んん? 

Recording: (5450/ 9621) 
 I don't argue with them, I don't debate it, it's just like... it might. 

Recording: (5451/ 9621) 
 and being able to meet them quicker and more effectively, I think. So, yeah. I have a lot of friends from other countries. Oh, yeah? And with their children, the types of parenting you do with your children, a lot of mainstream Americans look at them like that's so weird. Like breastfeeding until the child is like two or three years old is a fairly common thing in other countries. Here, it's just like people look at it like a little kid. I know. That's another thing I forgot to mention. Exactly. Just from family. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Really? Because I thought that meant my mother-in-law. you know, if it's not necessary to say it, then it's necessary not to say it. So it's just kind of in your home type of thing. And you don't really go around saying, Yeah, we sleep in the same bed and we breastfeed still and you just kind of they ask you like, Yeah, well, yeah, that's just the way we're doing it. So 

Recording: (5452/ 9621) 
 No, to live off campus, after my class, it'll be 22 and senior credit status. But my class was 21 or senior credit, so I got to move off campus. But had I been a year younger, I wouldn't have been able to because I have to wait until 22. 

Recording: (5453/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5454/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I start early and she starts late, so she gets the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then she can take the boy over to the daycare and then they're only there five hours or so. 

Recording: (5455/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I'm closer to the ones that feel the same way I do about things. My oldest sister, you know, I could stay on the phone so long, but we have such different opinions about things that, yeah, I don't stay on very long with her. 

Recording: (5456/ 9621) 
 And well, the people that own it are starting to build it up now, but it's been like that. It was the first apartment community in Columbus. It was built in 38, I guess. 

Recording: (5457/ 9621) 
 I'm so sorry. 

Recording: (5458/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5459/ 9621) 
 or some kind of tax program. 

Recording: (5460/ 9621) 
 No, it's kind of like you go to a private school and you get there maybe seven years old on up to 15, 16. And at 16, they can actually determine, give you a test and sit down with you and ask you about different things. And 16, 15, 16 year old could actually graduate from college. Yeah, they've showed that study already. I mean, I think it's amazing. Yeah. I mean, when I first heard about it, I said, eh, some Doogie Howser shit. But now it's just, now it's kind of reality, you know, because I know pretty much a lot of skilled trades. I know how to cook, pretty much know how to handle myself out in the wilderness. I mean, you know, go up on nature hikes and go fishing. All that stuff just combines into one. It's all about being an individual. And if those teachers can't study with that individual, know what that individual wants young, then older kids not gonna know what to do. End up practicing law and not liking it, going all that school for it. 

Recording: (5461/ 9621) 
 Yes. But it was interesting. They did have assemblies where they had religious assemblies. Religion wasn't all invasive in this school, but they did have assemblies for religious holidays and that kind of thing. And I remember thinking, it's interesting that the concept of eating somebody's flesh and blood, it's almost cult-like. And I'm thinking, I'm starting to think, well, what really separates a religion from a cult? And I think it's just the social acceptance of it, really, almost. You know, how many people are in it, probably? What number divides them? I'm not really sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I like, I was, I've been very politically active at various times in my past. And especially, I guess, in the late 70s and early 80s, I was very active in alternative energy, fighting against nuclear power, and I've been active at various times in animal rights movements and political campaigns, foreign policy kinds of debates, that kind of thing. And one thing that I've noticed a lot is there are a lot of, well, there's a wide spectrum, but there are a lot of liberals in the Catholic Church, too. 

Recording: (5462/ 9621) 
 We were floating around just didn't know if they were going to send us in or not because it was toward the end of it. 

Recording: (5463/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5464/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (5465/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (5466/ 9621) 
 I'm a Spanish major. 

Recording: (5467/ 9621) 
 is funny to have people care people apologize to you and when they're done with ever and it's like they care so much about somebody that they're talking to you on the phone for like five minutes uh... it is for people sometimes ask me like where where we are atomic homicide uh... taxes away from from uh... new jersey she's like twenty or something for for a long time she was she was real funny just uh how how accents are in Philly she would say like horrible and Saying numbers like like nine and or kind of like an East Coast accent It was real funny and she was just asking me like what it looks like in our building, you know That's always funny to you know, you call people from the phone. You don't know what they look like You don't know what the other person looks like and what the building is set up like It's interesting 

Recording: (5468/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5469/ 9621) 
 They're liking it, small town, living out in the country, raising the kids, big house, huge yard, dog. We keep looking and saying, now how's this different or better for the kids? 

Recording: (5470/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I like football and pool. 

Recording: (5471/ 9621) 
 And these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it. 

Recording: (5472/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5473/ 9621) 
 they're like three times more price wise. 

Recording: (5474/ 9621) 
 and just keep an eye on what's going on. 

Recording: (5475/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5476/ 9621) 
 but the writing, they give you one point for each paragraph, so you have to get five points to pass. Now you might get four out of five and almost pass, and then you have to retake that one part. 

Recording: (5477/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you have to concentrate on what's important or it just flies by and you don't even see it. Yeah. 

Recording: (5478/ 9621) 
 And the other one is a working cuff at the Steubenville, Ohio. 

Recording: (5479/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5480/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I grew up in Columbus. I was born here. I went to OSU for school. I was an undergrad. 

Recording: (5481/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I did. And then she was kind of a gossip. She went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support. Nobody would support her. 

Recording: (5482/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5483/ 9621) 
 You know, he's paying rent, and his mother was not really his mother-in-law, but her, so she can, right. He has become more responsible about a lot of things, which is, again, a normal maturation. But he's just doing it the hard way. 

Recording: (5484/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5485/ 9621) 
 The rail service, no. 

Recording: (5486/ 9621) 
 Well, and don't you think too that the more they have found out, psychologically speaking, about children and the placement of children in the family and the throes of not having enough or being sorely neglected because you were one of so many. I mean, Janet and I both know that experience from being one of 11 children raised. So, you know, you didn't have the advantages 

Recording: (5487/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5488/ 9621) 
 Well, I didn't know if you'd give them my name or... Yeah, there's a variety of places. Yeah, I could give your name to the main secretary. If you can. 

Recording: (5489/ 9621) 
 whatever his name is, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's into his kind of movies. I like Sixth Sense. I love that movie. 

Recording: (5490/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5491/ 9621) 
 Switch kids. 

Recording: (5492/ 9621) 
 Probably. 

Recording: (5493/ 9621) 
 I was about to say, now on the record or off the record. 

Recording: (5494/ 9621) 
 I'm from Columbus, Ohio. I was born and raised in Columbus. I grew up on the east side of Columbus. I graduated from high school. I then started working for Ohio State in 1977 and have been here for 24 years. 

Recording: (5495/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they are. 

Recording: (5496/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5497/ 9621) 
 And that's what a lot of people are telling me. You know, just, you know, life's a struggle. 

Recording: (5498/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5499/ 9621) 
 It wasn't easy. At first it was probably a lot harder than after you've been there for about six months and you start to just get used to things. But I took for granted coming back here. 

Recording: (5500/ 9621) 
 because the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction games and letter games and at least the daycare, all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff. It's not game game. It has a game theme to it. 

Recording: (5501/ 9621) 
 videos. 

Recording: (5502/ 9621) 
 I think that it would have been better for me if we had lived in New York. 

Recording: (5503/ 9621) 
 Boy, it would have to be something that I actually enjoy. What happened was, ever since I came to Columbus, almost every company I worked for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state. And I wasn't interested in that because my husband works for the state. So obviously he's not going anywhere. So I got tired of that and that's why I kind of went to temping and stuff. So it would be one with a variety. I'm unfortunately I say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff but that doesn't get to express my creative side as much so it would be my favorite job was one where I did the accounting but I dealt with people as well and like would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too. So right. 

Recording: (5504/ 9621) 
 And it's, you know, my mom, you know, she always said, well, what do you think I should do about this? And we always talk about different things. So I think it's kind of neat that I've been involved in a lot of the other kids that way. 

Recording: (5505/ 9621) 
 At our desk we had terminals that connected to a system. 

Recording: (5506/ 9621) 
 No, I just like it anyway. I like their culture a lot. 

Recording: (5507/ 9621) 
 Fruit loops, yeah. And it's like, what is the difference, you know, besides the price? 

Recording: (5508/ 9621) 
 But there are those that are out there that are willing to do that. 

Recording: (5509/ 9621) 
 They shouldn't know where the keys are, if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever. I mean, the fact that, how do you explain your way out of your kids taking guns to school? 

Recording: (5510/ 9621) 
 which was scheduled in the evenings when I was working, and I couldn't even go to therapy. 

Recording: (5511/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (5512/ 9621) 
 Oxlux is probably the closest place. 

Recording: (5513/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5514/ 9621) 
 I'm not going to do that.

 My boyfriend would love to mess with this. I just want you to know that he'd be like, ee, ee, ee, taking it apart, putting it back together. 

Recording: (5516/ 9621) 
 according to that. And so I can't think what some of their observations were, but there's usually just one or two lines of 

Recording: (5517/ 9621) 
 She, that's a grandmother, she lets the kids pretty much, you know. 

Recording: (5518/ 9621) 
 They go, she's got it, and they go on to the next guy, and then all of a sudden you're going off this way. And they go, so tonight, Juliet, where are you going? And you're like, he told me to, and then they go, oh, brother. So now the attention is diverted to you. So that's usually what the problem is, because most pilots are there real professional. 

Recording: (5519/ 9621) 
 I've given you plenty of opinions, haven't I? I've just loaded them on you. Okay. I just have a question. Is this a research project for a private organization or is it 

Recording: (5520/ 9621) 
 You know what, my parents never did because they knew I was always level-headed. I always had a lot of boyfriends, you know, but I always felt like I was waiting for the right one. 

Recording: (5521/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (5522/ 9621) 
 Instead of a doctor 

Recording: (5523/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (5524/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5525/ 9621) 
 Like I said, I've been here 25 years. I've seen a lot of weird stuff. Fact is, when I was a baker, I seen a manager that had nothing to do for 10 years. 

Recording: (5526/ 9621) 
 from the day one. 

Recording: (5527/ 9621) 
 Yes, but that has primarily because of necessity more often than not. Maybe even today it's less than that because it's been because of a loss of a parent or inability of a parent or parents being able to handle those children. So yes, those things do exist and they will always have some, but that's a very small percentage though, Scott. 

Recording: (5528/ 9621) 
 It doesn't matter how much money they're given for their education. 

Recording: (5529/ 9621) 
 When you think that our major resource is our children and our offspring, then we better not, you know. 

Recording: (5530/ 9621) 
 We're planning on moving in the spring. 

Recording: (5531/ 9621) 
 Well, number one, it's a little bit smaller, more controlled area. Quiet, no less. And get my mom closer to the sister. My sister lives up there. She moved there from down in West Virginia. So with mom having all the peace and quiet she wants, plus in a place that's only a year old, 

Recording: (5532/ 9621) 
 Sure! 

Recording: (5533/ 9621) 
 Just to get into the school, there's about 30 people applying. They let three in. 

Recording: (5534/ 9621) 
 Ia, hai. 

Recording: (5535/ 9621) 
 Yes, to some degree they should, but there we go again. It's just like the people when I worked in bars. They'd always want to hold the bartender responsible. But say you could come up, I'd give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else. 

Recording: (5536/ 9621) 
 All the cool apartments are on 161, all the great restaurants and everything. So that's where I lived. 

Recording: (5537/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5538/ 9621) 
 Well, actually it's sort of all happening in a certain area, you know, with, you know, very high unemployment, like council, council estates, you know, this sort of stereotype, you know, kind of bad family environment, you know, parents have loads of boyfriends and girlfriends, drugs, everything else. And, you know, a lot of these girls that have been interviewed, you know, say, oh, you know, I wanted something to love or, you know, we were bored, so we decided to have sex. And I mean, I find it just totally appalling. And, you know, a 13 year old boy who was interviewed was saying, oh, you know, he, you know, slept with like like 10 girls or something. And I'm thinking, oh my gosh, you know, and he's 13 and, you know, had a few kids and that was it. But in my opinion, the main problem there is they get more support even at that age when they have, they, you know, they get unemployment because once they've had a kid, even if they're not of working age, they get a certain amount of money. And then once they reach, I think, 15 or 16, if they have a baby, they're the top of the list for a council house. So they get their own, there was actually a long documentary on before I left, of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents, and her parents were at the end of their rope. She got pregnant, and she was like, well, hey, this is my ticket to move out, because she gets her own place, she gets money for herself, money for the baby, she doesn't have to pay any utilities or anything. And what more could she want, was basically what basically what she was saying I've got my own place I can do whatever I want I'm getting money and I don't have to work and and so that I think is a very bad situation because they're almost rewarded for you know 

Recording: (5539/ 9621) 
 Rise. 

Recording: (5540/ 9621) 
 Because I had a lot of frustration build up. What's next? Get a whole list there. 

Recording: (5541/ 9621) 
 So they built one out in Hilliard. 

Recording: (5542/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5543/ 9621) 
 know and without health insurance that'll cost a few hundred dollars and they have no means to help themselves at least if you assuming you were 18 you could get a job like and try and pay for your health insurance I mean I'm not saying it'd be easy but still 

Recording: (5544/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5545/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and then you can stay as long as you want. You don't, you know, feel obligated. And everybody just brings in food. You know, everybody brings their own stuff and it's fun. I mean, yeah, it is from Thanksgiving to Christmas. I mean, it's just nonstop family everywhere. So it's fun. 

Recording: (5546/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (5547/ 9621) 
 Hmm, where from? 

Recording: (5548/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she's got a lot of kids. There's three boys and like four girls. 

Recording: (5549/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5550/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5551/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (5552/ 9621) 
 I guess I like to do it, but I probably, I don't know. 

Recording: (5553/ 9621) 
 They're five hours from Colorado, so they still, badlands aren't too far away. And I guess it's like 900 miles from here, so they can still drive back. They come at least once, twice a year back to Ohio. 

Recording: (5554/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5555/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5556/ 9621) 
 thing at first, but she loves my kids and she loves my husband. 

Recording: (5557/ 9621) 
 Sometimes people just go on and on about things like I got a or like they have like some like insane problem Like I don't know why they're sharing it with me like you know like I had to get this You know I had to get this chair cuz my brother-in-law. Yeah, he sat on it and broke it man I got a fight with him about it. Yeah, his wife and blah blah going on and on about it. It's like Like yep like his wife is a bitch or something, I don't know, I don't know what they expect me to say. Or like I talked to this one guy, he was a Navy SEAL and he did like a couple tours in Vietnam and he was talking about how he was drunk and he was from Alabama and he was like, yeah I'm about half drunk now so I'm trying to figure out where his model number is and like, I don't know, we talked to him for like 15 minutes 

Recording: (5558/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (5559/ 9621) 
 I'm serious. 

Recording: (5560/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she went down to Western Missouri. 

Recording: (5561/ 9621) 
 No, no. In fact, the principal, when she interviewed me, asked me that. And I said, when we're raised in the Unitarian Sunday School, it's almost an indoctrination and tolerance for other religions. So you're better off with me than somebody that believes theirs is the only one true religion. 

Recording: (5562/ 9621) 
 The gossip I heard was that the superintendent of schools said that if he was re-elected, she was going to resign and so they gave her a big raise. He must be a thorn in her side. 

Recording: (5563/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well people don't have the priorities that they should. What do you do? You work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die. What did you do? Did you learn anything? Did you teach anyone? Did you have an opinion about anything? That to me, if you don't have time, then you're just floating along, trying to take it up space. 

Recording: (5564/ 9621) 
 There's like two people who are like from the, I mean they're not old, but they're like from the 40s and they have bought generators, they bought water, they've got extra food, they've got a freeze, extra freezers, they bought ammunition. It's like, hello? You know, I just think it's 

Recording: (5565/ 9621) 
 They, yeah, well, the grandmother, she says she's a Christian, but I don't see it. I mean, a lot of people claim they're something and, you know, which I might not be a total Christian, because I don't do all the right things, but I do believe in God. I do believe I'm going to go to heaven. I try not to, you know, sin too much. And I do pray to him. And I, you know, I just I don't go to church like I used to go to church all when I was growing up. Now I feel like you don't have to go to church to believe in God and all that. I talk to him. I talk to my grandparents that are in heaven. That's just what I was raised as. 

Recording: (5566/ 9621) 
 I think in Spanish here they had two murders over there and it was publicized in the Columbus area. 

Recording: (5567/ 9621) 
 Sure! 

Recording: (5568/ 9621) 
 And they might be something as easy as, what are the three colors in our flag? Or how much do you have to have of the Senate to pass a law? It could be something real, real technical or something that a three-year-old can answer. Because it's trying to hit all the areas that you've learned. 

Recording: (5569/ 9621) 
 But most of the vegetables are available, truly. The zucchini, you'll find your green peppers smaller. I got a cucumber the other day, and usually they're so big, and I tell you, I don't think it was that long. 

Recording: (5570/ 9621) 
 pray. 

Recording: (5571/ 9621) 
 I mean, obviously that's a long ways off. I guess I imagine I would be teaching in public school, so hopefully I could try to get them where I was. But I don't know. I mean, maybe, I don't know. I don't even know if it's Dublin really better than Columbus Public. 

Recording: (5572/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5573/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well he thinks he can do it. 

Recording: (5574/ 9621) 
 Well, the coach, he's pretty much got it all together. He just needs to put everybody in their own separate category instead of having one person for one part of the team and another person for another part of the team. 

Recording: (5575/ 9621) 
 Yes, yeah, that's right. You can't get a seat there. 

Recording: (5576/ 9621) 
 you're right on the top. 

Recording: (5577/ 9621) 
 They'd heard it all before and some of them had known me for a few years. I was told after I retired that she was actually easier to get along with when I was there than anyone else. I don't believe that. Yeah. 

Recording: (5578/ 9621) 
 OK, well, just call me Rachel. And I'm 24. I've got a two-year-old son. He's just had his birthday, the 31st. And I live by myself in a house. And I work in the accounting department. 

Recording: (5579/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (5580/ 9621) 
 may be kind of hard in a, that she gets into an engineering tech program because she hasn't had all the math prerequisites because she just didn't stay in school long enough. 

Recording: (5581/ 9621) 
 So what kind of example is he setting for everybody else? 

Recording: (5582/ 9621) 
 I made a difference. 

Recording: (5583/ 9621) 
 No offense, it's easier on a dry call up. 

Recording: (5584/ 9621) 
 Oh, bro. 

Recording: (5585/ 9621) 
 He talks about biting even though he's never bit. And there's one particular boy right now when his family leaves, he just has complete temper tantrums. And he's tried that out a few times too. He's one you can leave and it doesn't phase him. He's very comfortable with other people. But like the last month or so, he's tried that a few times. And I think he picked that up at daycare, seeing the other kids do that. 

Recording: (5586/ 9621) 
 I mean there are split seconds where you just want to shoot somebody. Unfortunately, anybody says that. I mean I'm I don't even like stepping on ants but there's those moments where you're like 

Recording: (5587/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (5588/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't know if it's Monroe County or... 

Recording: (5589/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I think everybody should have, if nothing else, you missed the boat by that time. 

Recording: (5590/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5591/ 9621) 
 I guess it's just over the course of the year, everything balances out, you know. 

Recording: (5592/ 9621) 
 Damn. 

Recording: (5593/ 9621) 
 Hmm? 

Recording: (5594/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (5595/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5596/ 9621) 
 Both times I stayed around this little town. It's like northwest of Munich. So it was southern. Most Brooklyn 

Recording: (5597/ 9621) 
 Europe. 

Recording: (5598/ 9621) 
 Kind of dwindling. 

Recording: (5599/ 9621) 
 With the children, yeah. 

Recording: (5600/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I went to Columbus Public Schools. Always over on the west side, same area of town. Always lived there. I live there now. Came up here to OSU. Got my bachelor's in English Lit. And then went to Case Western Reserve for a master's. Then I decided I wanted to go somewhere else in the country. Which I got my library degree. And the only job I could find was here in Columbus. 

Recording: (5601/ 9621) 
 But I think one of the things that you see people do a lot that really bothers me is that whole thing about 

Recording: (5602/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5603/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I know. I think too, I apologize to my oldest daughter almost every day about the poor thing all I put her through when we were trying to grow up together. And I was 24 when she was born, so I wasn't a child. But it's like, you don't have realistic expectations of what children are capable of or what they can do. Because if they're really verbal, my kids always have been really verbal because I've talked to them from the moment they were born. Even when they couldn't talk to me, that was irrelevant. I was talking to them the whole time. So I would talk to them the whole time. So they would always be very verbal. It seemed like they had a much better understanding and could do things better than they really could. When my daughter was about five, we got a hamster. I said, you know, you make sure you give it food and water and when it died I was so surprised that she hadn't given it been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five-year-old you don't yeah they don't get that stuff together or when she was 11 we sold her bedroom furniture and I gave her the money to keep so she could wait to buy something else well within three or four months it was gone know? And so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because, but I mean, all that was bizarre. Now, with my other kids, first of all, I would have better sense than to do those things. I would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it. And secondly, 

Recording: (5604/ 9621) 
 Anyway, you know, so just simply living 

Recording: (5605/ 9621) 
 the government. It's whoever wants to be. 

Recording: (5606/ 9621) 
 personal communications John Doe who speaks here, he has the famous idea who Jane Doe is over here. On the personal, it used to be that yeah, you knew who this person was over here, Jane Doe who lives in that third house. And she married Henry Jackson. Don't you remember old Henry? Boy, Henry was a guy that lived way over there. 

Recording: (5607/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah. 

Recording: (5608/ 9621) 
 You can't isolate yourself from them. It's like Americans don't have a stronghold on it. 

Recording: (5609/ 9621) 
 Well, I'll be honest. I have a lot of homosexual friends. And being in the restaurant business and growing up in the restaurant business, and that's how I really kind of met him. When I was going to school, I didn't know any. And I went to OU. And honestly, down there, I didn't know. I didn't know anybody was gay. I feel that a lot of people, or I'll say most of them, or all of them, are born that way. Some of them do make a choice. But I feel that it should be talked about in school. For so long, it was in the closet. They didn't talk about it, and these kids had to hide it. And I just think in today's world, and there's so many people that that are openly gay that it should be talked about more in school. I do. I think, you know, especially, I just think some, and women, there's women that, you know, I had my gym teacher in Brookhaven now that I look at it, I didn't know then, but she was gay. I mean, we didn't, I didn't think that then. I don't know why, but she was very manly, but she was very, she was very good, but she was, you know, just not feminine at all. 

Recording: (5610/ 9621) 
 Uh... 

Recording: (5611/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5612/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's always kind of scary. I think you really need to get away from that to get yourself back. 

Recording: (5613/ 9621) 
 and therefore I'm cool. 

Recording: (5614/ 9621) 
 I'm trying to think, it's a Meijer brand, I know that's what we have. It's like Frutos instead of... 

Recording: (5615/ 9621) 
 Well, somehow or other, yeah. And if everybody would just begin to build that way, and when they start to say something nasty, you would think, would I want them to say that to me? 

Recording: (5616/ 9621) 
 So the way the university here is run, I can't agree with most of the stuff they do. 

Recording: (5617/ 9621) 
 Changing the words doesn't change how someone feels about something. 

Recording: (5618/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (5619/ 9621) 
 I met him here the year I moved back from Florida and he had just moved back from Dallas. He had lived there for 10 years. 

Recording: (5620/ 9621) 
 I read and

 of dialogue under one of their cartoons, and the cartoon told most of it. 

Recording: (5622/ 9621) 
 I didn't own a telephone because I couldn't afford one. I thought if I had one, they'd call me. If I didn't get up that time on my day off, they'd come knocking at the door and say, 

Recording: (5623/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (5624/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5625/ 9621) 
 I hope not. Some of these mongers that goes around and always predicts the worst things like everybody's saying at the end of, you know, 2000 happens. Don't go out and celebrate New Year's Eve. The world's got to end. Well, how's it got to end? You know? 

Recording: (5626/ 9621) 
 And otherwise than that, I don't have hardly any trouble with the kids. I have more trouble with the parents. 

Recording: (5627/ 9621) 
 Then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department. 

Recording: (5628/ 9621) 
 So you know now that's just like they consider that like urban. 

Recording: (5629/ 9621) 
 just employers need to be, employers just need to do that on their own. And it's tough to be able to trust a business like that, but it's a private business. They need to be able to 

Recording: (5630/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5631/ 9621) 
 Lassie. I think I could summarize just with a few words of what you're meaning to say may be wrong But I think you're really meaning to say we must get back to the family. There must be two parents and they must recognize their children and do like you have just discussed, do with them. And because today we're just drifting and drifting and drifting. 50% of everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as I understand the statistics today. Unfortunately it is still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease, not reverse probably. Once again we are talking about communications too And the communications can be ill and they can be great, as she's touched upon. But I feel that pendulum has to swing back from the non-family we're headed toward or have been headed toward and get back to a very basic family orientation. It's abhorrent when I hear that, what was it, seven ladies who were quote beautiful ladies are now willing to sell their sperm, well it's not their sperm, whatever it is they sell, for $10,000 a piece to be implanted in another so that they can produce a quote, beautiful child. Well, a beautiful child, and if you're talking about just the physical features, is meaningless. It's what is embodied in that body that can be beautiful instead of just the physical features that you look at. And that to me is abhorrent. Such an idea. And that indeed is going to take away from family. In my way of thinking, I can't imagine that I would have my wife producing somebody else's child over here, and I'm going to have the same... Thank you, that's exactly... fatherly love, fatherly value, fatherly instincts toward or with that child.

 Anyway, he went in for less than a year, I think, and then he was discharged. And then he was called back in and sent to Vietnam. And it was a sort of a traumatic experience for him that I think he has pretty well come out of. But he was in a rear area. He never was up where he was doing any shooting himself, but he was on KP one day, and he said they had a big, an area out away from any of the other buildings where they burned trash and that sort of stuff. So he said, the mess sergeant said, Shoemaker, take that can of trash out and burn it. You probably better just take some gasoline to throw on the stuff to get it to burn. So he did. He went out there and threw some gasoline on it, not knowing that one of the other KPs had been there ahead of him and thrown gasoline on it. So there was, I don't know how much gasoline on it. When he threw a match on it,

 So. 

Recording: (5659/ 9621) 
 Is it like a honeymoon destination too? Like the Caribbean, Jamaica? 

Recording: (5660/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5661/ 9621) 
 I've always been into art. In high school I went to art, like a ball. And I was for fine arts. And I've always wanted to do art, because I can't do anything else. No, it's mostly, I'm not good at math. I mean, I could probably major in English or something like that, but not math. This is the talent. My husband's good at math, so that's where I go. I'm grateful for that. 

Recording: (5662/ 9621) 
 We're not going to make as much money. The people are going to say, gee, I'm not going to them. I'm going to go someplace else. Again, it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in our society. We care less about anybody else. We don't, hey, if I have problems, the government is going to help me out. That's a mindset that's been entrenched for 40 some years. It's a mindset that if you talk to the older generations that are dying off now, that said we would never have had in our lifetime. It's a rule nation in our country. And if you're old enough to remember Khrushchev, I believe Khrushchev is right. We will bury you. We'll bury you internally. In other words, we will break you up. You will separate internally. You have dysfunctional people. We're dysfunctional families. If you ever work on pastoral care activity, you'll find out that people are so concerned about their families, they fail, they think, because their family's broken up, they've got single parents here, they got divorced here, they don't know what's going on, they're on drugs. Well, the problem is we never got involved. As you said, business, we make more time, you know, there's more time spent for soccer on Sunday than going to church you talk about They said was it meet the press quote I think slogan is a day without me the Sunday about me to press, you know David was it? So like Sunday's not a Sunday about me to press Well, hey that just tells you right there where our thoughts are We're only thinking of ourselves I'll guarantee it as you get older You start thinking a little differently and I think as you talk you should be talking to some older people I'm saying people in the in their 80s Define how the progression of life is and how you think because when you go to estate sales All you're talking about this is profit motive? You're sitting on the lawns. The quality of life is in the mind of the person. You avoid it all the time. 

Recording: (5663/ 9621) 
 Yes and no. When we were in Boy Scouts, we got kicked out of it. 

Recording: (5664/ 9621) 
 Did you get a tape of everything? I don't care if it's overtime or not as long as... 

Recording: (5665/ 9621) 
 Not at all. 

Recording: (5666/ 9621) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (5667/ 9621) 
 Just want to get. 

Recording: (5668/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5669/ 9621) 
 I like it a lot. It's changed a lot since I've been here. I mean, it's really come a long way in terms of the amenities of civilization. You know, restaurants and museums, and we get all the good movies now, and Wexner Center's been a big boost. So it's a whole different town than it was when I first came here. But it's still relatively cheap, and it's easy to get around. And it's got a lot going for it. 

Recording: (5670/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5671/ 9621) 
 I think that with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing, I think people are starting to look at it a little differently. 

Recording: (5672/ 9621) 
 Transportation issue, I thought that rail system looked kind of cool, which is kind of tough. The question is do we want to spend the money on it and would people actually use it? I think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you're looking at people driving both ways. And I think if people are actually going to make it so people are actually going to use it, I think it would probably be a pretty good thing to have. And I voted for it. I can't believe you're going to do that. 

Recording: (5673/ 9621) 
 You know, so. 

Recording: (5674/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (5675/ 9621) 
 but I don't see it as negatively affecting me. I still get all the stuff done I need to get done. 

Recording: (5676/ 9621) 
 Yeah, from the strike, yeah. Actually, a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off, so it didn't make you feel as needed as you wanted to be. Yeah, we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went on strike, and I think the bosses knew this was coming, so a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then. 

Recording: (5677/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (5678/ 9621) 
 Oh yes, they are. 

Recording: (5679/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's what it is. It's a marketing thing. 

Recording: (5680/ 9621) 
 Heh. 

Recording: (5681/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5682/ 9621)

 Yeah, stops in front of my house. 

Recording: (5686/ 9621) 
 So when we got married, we were together a year, we were engaged a year, and we knew as soon as he finished school, within three months, we got married, bought a house, was pregnant with Megan.

 We usually use the word earlier in your statement, what we should buy. 

Recording: (5688/ 9621) 
 Oh, there we go. Okay. 

Recording: (5689/ 9621) 
 And you just, it's ear related. Being able to play is related to how well you can hear and how well you can project what you want to hear into how you form your mouth and what comes out. 

Recording: (5690/ 9621) 
 Yeah, one's an alternative school and the other one's just a regular trashy public school. 

Recording: (5691/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5692/ 9621) 
 We've got girls names, so we've got either Sydney or Mackenzie for a girl. 

Recording: (5693/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5694/ 9621) 
 Oh, 

Recording: (5695/ 9621) 
 It's hard. 

Recording: (5696/ 9621) 
 Isn't that fun? 

Recording: (5697/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. Like, you have to say at the end of the call, you're supposed to tell them, you know, don't forget to try your member benefits online at .com. And like, I guess sometimes I'll say it real, you know, like, kind of like the movie phone voice. I'll be like .com. People are just like, okay. 

Recording: (5698/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so they're like not American ways, you know. 

Recording: (5699/ 9621) 
 I would say, see in mine, I don't think they really were because I can't really say for anybody else's, but we had intended on having a, we got divorced in 88 and we had intended within the next couple, three years of having joint custody. But then our divorce was somewhat bitter or it became even more bitter and everything, you know. So that tended not to happen. And then she ended up getting transferred to St. Louis from here. So it was something that really wouldn't have been able to happen once she moved out there. And that was in the 90s. 

Recording: (5700/ 9621) 
 You have the option to take your bed down. I had to take mine down because I broke my ankle fall quarter. 

Recording: (5701/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm.

 And I'm like, how can you go, gitchy, gitchy, goo, Harriet?

Recording: (5704/ 9621) 
 It's... 

Recording: (5705/ 9621) 
 or more accurately, I think she took it, but it's a fine line. And so she wears that around and I replaced it. So I have my own again. I wear this one around. So we have a competition to see who can get the most well-traveled ring. You get two points for every country and you get one point for every state or province within that country. 

Recording: (5706/ 9621) 
 there were things out there's nothing like what they have today you know the small little handguns and things like that that are really easy, carryable and concealable I mean like you know back in the 60s stuff like that I mean they had switchblades things like that yeah I mean I mean there's really nothing too different 

Recording: (5707/ 9621) 
 Maybe. 

Recording: (5708/ 9621) 
 It's better in terms of the yards. 

Recording: (5709/ 9621) 
 Well actually he was, I don't know if you've heard about the Academy deal. Well he was one of the teachers that tried to start a union and was fired. 

Recording: (5710/ 9621) 
 Well, she's got a boyfriend, so she's busy. And she lives off campus too. So she lives out in Hilliard actually. It's far. 

Recording: (5711/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5712/ 9621) 
 Man I wish I knew what to buy this week 

Recording: (5713/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5714/ 9621) 
 Scary. Okay. And it was funny because you see the cops first, but in reality the cops are behind two other people that I actually know. But it doesn't matter because you always see cops first. So the two other people that I actually know are my stepmother's parents. Stepmother and father have been split up for, I don't know, a month or two now. They've been married for something like six months now. And my sister and I both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she was making a horrible mistake, but she wouldn't have listened to us, so we didn't bother telling her. 

Recording: (5715/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5716/ 9621) 
 And I mean, I don't think a lot of people have ever heard of Ecstasy until that movie. 

Recording: (5717/ 9621) 
 How long have you been here? 

Recording: (5718/ 9621) 
 I had the same thing happen to my kid. I smacked him one time. 

Recording: (5719/ 9621) 
 professors and everything, but I think, you know, they get a lot of these kids and they don't care about school, but they leave early because they know they can do it. 

Recording: (5720/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5721/ 9621) 
 Right, yeah. 

Recording: (5722/ 9621) 
 fire a couple rounds and pull right back in. So that night our captain, who was one of these go-go guys, took one of our guns and the gun crew and went up to where they could line aim on that 

Recording: (5723/ 9621) 
 Och jag. 

Recording: (5724/ 9621) 
 He does a lot of maintenance. He was doing drywall before this. I kind of wish he stuck with that. 

Recording: (5725/ 9621) 
 Moss, Bill Moss, he's always saying, oh, this is racist and that's racist. But I don't think it's too bad in Columbus. I know there are places lots worse like the south and so on, of course. Who really knows the race issue is such a big question. 

Recording: (5726/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5727/ 9621) 
 Isn't that amazing? 

Recording: (5728/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (5729/ 9621) 
 but I'm not sure how it's going to work. OSU's website is under construction. I was like, whoa, darn it. So then my aunt works here and all my cousins, most of them graduated here so I kind of want to follow them. Go with the flow. But I did some other ones, emailed and if you have this program can you tell me something about it. And it was actually I think with students met for the first time at their graduation, they finished their whole college on the internet. I said, well that would be very easy for me and I could do it at my convenience, like when he's asleep I can go and do that. I think it would make it a lot easier to get up. Getting up is a very hard task. Very big bags, like I can't see. 

Recording: (5730/ 9621) 
 I don't know. This freedom, semi-quasi-freedom. There's an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom. And the Indian people know the big difference of that. 

Recording: (5731/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5732/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so or how hard can it be to say to a student, if you have a student with an ADIQ, for example, and you know he's not going to get all the details and the battles and the years and the captain's names, but you just want him to get the overall gist of the French and American War was about this time in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted, just the main concepts. Well, there's the kid that you say, Todd, you study for the test and when you come in, I'll let you answer anything on the test you know. And anything you don't know, you leave blank and I'll just grade what you put down. 

Recording: (5733/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (5734/ 9621) 
 The government, yeah the government. Mayors, but then look at them. I mean there's another example. Well yeah, I mean, so that's not the case, but it's a man too. I mean I think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we've had to live with them forever. Even G movies that little kids are going to see, if there's a woman in there, 

Recording: (5735/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (5736/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (5737/ 9621) 
 It's very informal here, so I don't know what we were doing, but. 

Recording: (5738/ 9621) 
 like that, like solitary. But like unlimited solitary, that doesn't seem right either. 

Recording: (5739/ 9621) 
 down. 

Recording: (5740/ 9621) 
 and his parents can pick him up. And everybody was annoyed. My husband said, I would have let her stay. I don't understand why you're doing this. I don't care. I want her to come home. Well, the bottom line, it was hysterical because she and this little boy, they're outside. He's jumping on the trampoline. I go out to him, and I introduce myself. And I say, you know, honey, I said, I'm really sorry about the plans, but I just could not let her stay there that long. He goes, oh, that's OK. My mom would never let me do that. So I'm thinking, here's how everybody's acting like I'm the bad guy. And I'm the one who's into, right. And so I used to take over, I think it was funny, because there was something, she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that I wouldn't let her skip, because it was for a party that her friends were having. And I understood it was important to her, but when you have commitments, you keep your commitments. And so, he was saying he agreed with me. And I said, look, even your dad thinks that in this case, she goes, so what's with him? He never has an opinion. How come all of a sudden he's allowed to have an opinion? Tell me what I can do. You know, it was really funny. We laughed about it. And I let her, I let her skip it. Because I decided that it was so important to her. 

Recording: (5741/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but I mean, we're not in a depression and the employment rate is fine and health care, we've got some improvements there. And like I said, that student loan thing, it's a big nose. But I just, I mean, so I wouldn't say he's done a horrible, horrible job. But I mean, I think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we've wasted where we could have spent that money on something else. And you end up doing that. 

Recording: (5742/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5743/ 9621) 
 I think they do. 

Recording: (5744/ 9621) 
 Is that the way Jesus Christ would have brought that here? Well, some people have their opinion. I said, no, no. I said, you wear that collar, you do something about that. If you don't, then I realize what a spineless person you are. But you'll never find me in your church again. So I've done what I've done. But there's a lot of people out there that will read a book on Native American spirituality and they'll become self-proclaimed spiritual leaders. They'll learn about the sweats. There's some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges, which you're not supposed to do. They show step-by-step how to build one and tell you what some kind of wood to build it out of and 90% of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood. There's a way to do it. There's a way to do it. It has to be done that way traditionally and there was a reason for that. Because the people of this land were given specific instructions from the creator through visions, through a woman called the White Buffalo Calf Woman that came to the people and brought them these ceremonies like the sweat lodge, that brought them the sacred pipe. It's not a belief thing. It's a way of life. And it's a way of life that's still in danger of being snuffed out. But it won't be. It's just, it won't be. It's just, we gotta be careful about How and what you do and if you look, you know Native American spirituality or religion for lack of a better word Because our people believe that religion you can't You can't encompass one word everything that is into one word 

Recording: (5745/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (5746/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5747/ 9621) 
 No, not at all. I think in the United States, it's the driving force of our government. Without a revenue base from the taxes of corporations, you couldn't have nearly the things that we've had. And I think, to a degree, they've become fairly powerful, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. When the unions were really strong, I thought, I was was reading about it, I thought that was a good thing as well because that supported the person. But you could, if you have good relations with your labor, you don't necessarily need a union. 

Recording: (5748/ 9621) 
 Our dorms were cleaner. 

Recording: (5749/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

Recording: (5756/ 9621) 
 And she blew up on me too, you know. 

Recording: (5757/ 9621) 
 I can see where the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into gay people or whatever just because obviously you basically mimic your parents as far as what you do when you're young and Things like that and obviously if you so had to male parents or whatever Obviously you might be thinking problem, but I don't know if that would honestly happen.

Recording: (5767/ 9621) 
 I had to pack it up. 

Recording: (5768/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and geometry, and trig, and calculus, and physics, and a little smattering of everything. And I bet I couldn't pass the math without some instruction. But my son didn't pass the writing part. He passed everything but the writing part. And the writing part, they asked you to write two five-paragraph essays. And they give you these topics, and and you can pick from them and you have to do it right there in like a three hour block of time. 

Recording: (5769/ 9621) 
 I sort of wore out. That and just, oh, there were two reasons I left. One, I was getting exhausted and it was just so demanding and we didn't know as a community how to let up. So I had to withdraw. Another thing was I'm very into metaphysics and studying and meditating. We had no time whatsoever. Everybody was in there. That's one disagreement I have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in January. So there's always people coming for four or five days and you have to explain everything in life to them in four or five days. And plus we lived in a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant and a hardware and had a mail route. And then we had all these visitors and then we made our own bread and we milked a cow. And so it's just plain hard physical work plus all the mental stuff of dealing with people's really big questions. It was intense. You know, so that's the reason I had to quit. It was like if I could leave this situation for a month or six weeks and get caught up within myself, I would have been okay, but that wasn't how it worked. So I had to pull back from it. 

Recording: (5770/ 9621) 
 I don't think it's bad, because he did go to a daycare when he was little, before his grandmother started watching him. And I mean, you've got people you don't know watching your kid, and that's kind of scary. But you've got to check things out first before you put your kid anywhere.

 It's probably not as convinced and packed as most tourist areas. Australia is a little out of the way. You have to spend some time to get there. You're in Florida or California. If you want to go to the beach, you don't have to say, oh, like Memorial Day. It's like, forget it. Just forget it. But with Australia, at least you don't have to worry about fighting the tourists.

 I mean that goes along with my customs and beliefs. I mean we're going to send our child I already know to parochial schools. There's no way I'm going to send him to a public school. And even my husband's a Boy Scout leader. And just listening to the boys there. He did a program last night on respect.

 Yeah, we've kind of broken her of that. Thank goodness, the counter stuff. 

Recording: (5782/ 9621) 
 Today's society does describe the need entirely differently than what I would. Talking to this gentleman last night, we got back and we were comparing our early life. We didn't even know what a nickel or a dime was. That was unimportant. And we also were talking about how we went. He was telling me a little bit about it and I said, stop you Paul. I said Paul What kind of shoes did you wear in the summer? He said we didn't wear any shoes. Aha And then I told him how we didn't either I came from a very large family Mostly boys we would take our show shoes off as soon as the year as we could in the springtime We would store them in tallow and jars of tallow tallow is lamb lard if you want to call it that and that was a preservative and Then when it became cold enough in September October, maybe even as far as November this this year would have been November, we would take those shoes out. And depending upon whose foot fit those shoes, those would be the person who wore them. It wouldn't be the one who had worn them in the spring, because he's growing in the meantime, and it may go to another, another. And I can remember we passed shoes down as many as four, we children. Now my dad also repaired shoes. He repaired shoes. He cut our hair. What today that would be the most horrible thing is some of the kids that I need me a pair of. I don't know you want advertising on here or not but it's not. I want a Nike or I want a Rocky or I want to guess. Those, that's pure luxury, no needs at all. But to today's society, 

Recording: (5783/ 9621) 
 Yeah. for the area instead of people being homeless and you know jobless everything like that. I mean I hear in New York City where it's a lot more populated it's getting real bad. Of course you probably know about that.

 Yeah, we could actually use the Granview library. They have a really good library there and a large selection of videos and they have story time things where they read to the kids and get them interested in books and you know, different type of things where you can win things for reading amount of books.

 That's right. They just said they just asked it the wrong way.

 Yeah, but they don't have it.

 He was adjusting on us and we couldn't do it, we didn't catch on to where it was right away. But by the time we started looking for holes which weren't deep enough, we realized that he was in a clump of cactus.

 Hmm

 So the math server has tons of extra room on it. So he just kind of snuck in our account. It is legal, but I'm not sure how related to the university it is.

 It's for the entire state. And so this is just the Columbus. There's Columbus, Toledo, Dayton. I don't know any others.

 Yeah, my mom didn't like that. She said, when they go to school, they're going to have a different last name than you. I'm like, so what? I don't care.

 Right.

Recording: (5796/ 9621) 
 If it were possible, I think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now. And that's another problem. It seems like the way the financial world has come up and everything else, the way the cost of living has increased, it almost takes two parents in that home if you want to really live a halfway decent life and be able to do some of the extra things. No one wants to live and only have to be able to disuse, like you said, the necessities. 

Recording: (5797/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5798/ 9621) 
 Is that is that where people go snorkeling?

 Uh-huh, particularly.

 Usually Clintonville, my mom, she's not a big fan of driving. She doesn't really drive very much, which is good. I've ridden in a car with her one time and she just would prefer not to and that's okay with us because she's got a driver's license for ID and those types of things. But for the most part, so she kind of stays like Clintonville area.

Recording: (5803/ 9621) 
 No, the funniest thing that was with my husband and the youngest child because he's so he's so fair and he said in the hospital people were looking at him like there's no way that could happen. He said that because you know they take him off to weigh him or whatever and I said you don't leave him. He said people were looking at him like

 But if that PhD was given to you, if they lowered the standards, if they lowered the standards for you to get into graduate school, wouldn't that be challenging for you? Hey, great, they lowered it for me. My sister didn't, oh, she had a rough time getting in, but now I can get in here, I can lower standards.

 It's just older artists, more established artists.

 I only have a few kids from time to time that said they want to be writers, which you know they have great ideas but usually they can't, they can tell you them but when they write it, my kids usually they leave out words or they leave off a suffix at the end and the sentence makes no sense. I have to call them up and go, what does this say? 

Recording: (5810/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5811/ 9621) 
 They go to clubs, they go to bars, clubs, raves, any place where there's dancing. 

Recording: (5812/ 9621) 
 I mean that's definitely a possibility for career wise down the road but I don't know I'll have to see sort of where that takes me.

 I was going to say most of them are.

 you know, it's a big building, what are you going to do with it?

 Usually whatever ones I can find. You got Columbus Alive and just not quite that. 

Recording: (5817/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5818/ 9621) 
 And I was more surprised that they found a lot of alcohol. Like I wouldn't, you know, like some people, if they do drugs at school and stuff, I'm not saying that's right, but they'll do it. But like alcohol, it'd be so hard to hide because it smells, you know, and you got to hold it out. But they found like bottles of liquor. 

Recording: (5819/ 9621) 
 I think, I think through education that's, it's just going to only help. 

Recording: (5820/ 9621) 
 I'm out.

 If you say buy, buy from those unscrupulous business people, and say, gee, these guys can't have credit. What happens to that person that files bankruptcy? Oh, I'm bankrupt, okay, I'll do something else next time.

 Well I never really think I had, first of all I didn't have the motivation I don't think to put in the effort to do it but I don't think I had very good advisors when I was first here. I didn't really understand the idea that UBC was separate from art college and that you had to apply and I didn't really know, I just was like oh okay.

Recording: (5831/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5832/ 9621) 
 Right, they look at more what you have to say than your clothes. That was something I remember them talking about too. You don't want them to look at what you're wearing. And that's mostly, that was a good thing for the dress code.

 Okay. 

Recording: (5834/ 9621) 
 Hmm.

 Divorced, yeah.

 Which I'm so happy for because she didn't she did a little bit more were kids but she never did again like yeah she was just by herself for like years and years. She's 50 now. 

Recording: (5841/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5842/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I hope we're going to get there. 

Recording: (5843/ 9621) 
 things get away from it all yeah yeah so I came down here because he knew where my parents lived in plus Columbus was a lot more opportunity 

Recording: (5844/ 9621) 
 Well, I've found that, I mean, everyone has, people from outside of the United States have stereotypes about the United States, and when they actually get to know someone, those stereotypes dissipate. I mean, I actually had a conversation very similar to this the other night with a couple of Germans that I met at a coffee house. I mean the stereotype that most Americans have of Germans are those of Bavarians and not real Bavarians but stereotypical Bavarians. Beer drinking, bratwurst eating, sauerkraut eating, lederhose wearing, you know, 

Recording: (5845/ 9621) 
 until I threatened to sue them.

 Do you really? Somebody says you could like walk up there's like some sort of staircase and you can actually walk up to her head if you really if you really want to go up and walk up to her head you can do that. 

Recording: (5847/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and since it's not sponsored officially by the university, they can do whatever they want. And they don't have any possibility of, I'm looking for a word here, repercussions. 

Recording: (5848/ 9621) 
 I've been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women. Sometimes I felt kind of weird about it.

 I'm a senior. 

Recording: (5850/ 9621) 
 I can't. 

Recording: (5851/ 9621) 
 So it's an adjustment to get back into it, but I do like it up there better as far as possibilities of working closer to home and stuff and not having to worry about a bus. 

Recording: (5852/ 9621) 
 They're like, oh, they are like the people in Crocodile Dundee, but they're just, no, they're just like. 

Recording: (5853/ 9621) 
 I think for the most part people can handle it. Obviously I think probably more the older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it. The ones that grew up like during the whole black rights movements and things like that. I could see them having a problem with it but I mean more like more the generations of today or whatever like basically anyone under the age of about 40 or 50 or so, I think that they could probably deal with it. I mean, I don't think it'd cause any huge problems or anything like that. 

Recording: (5854/ 9621) 
 It's right on their main street and they have gorgeous, really neat, unique things. 

Recording: (5855/ 9621) 
 because they've done away with civil service step raises, which were wrong because I could have done a crummy job and got the same raises doing a good job. Don't get me wrong. But now it is that you got people you don't even respect in management a lot of times given the raises and they have no idea what you're even doing. 

Recording: (5856/ 9621) 
 and there's like nothing in it. And you know, it's like go down the list. That's what I do. He just thinks I automatically know I'm a mind reader. That's what it is. 

Recording: (5857/ 9621) 
 I'm very proud of the way her and her sister are but I just think it's because mom was home and You know, there was somebody there to listen to them and it doesn't have to be mom I mean, you know mom can go work and dad can stay home. There's nothing wrong with that either But I just think they need mom or dad there every day when they come home So they know when they come home and they've had a really bad day and something's really bothering them They can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours and letting it kind of fade away And then when everybody comes home, it's like well, how's school? Okay

 This is fun.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5887/ 9621) 
 I experienced it well. In some of our ceremonies, this is confidential, right? No one else is going to see this because I don't want to have any of this printed or anything. 

Recording: (5888/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it got into a situation where you really weren't, there was a no-win situation from the get-go. And I think that had we been able to do what we went over there to do initially, it would have worked out okay, but we weren't. So it became a political war, as everybody knows, and they're thinking about it.

 Not in my lifetime. He'd have to probably be a closet gay. 

Recording: (5890/ 9621) 
 Well, that's just it, that's part of it because like, see my parents wouldn't come, my mother used to try to come to things at school when I would be in different things. And I really did appreciate, but my father would not, he just would, she'd say, well, you know, he just doesn't like that kind of thing. I mean, I would be in the Sunday spelling bee, I would be in the, he doesn't, well, too damn bad, get your butt down there and pretend like you like it. And so, you know, with our family, and my husband's the same way. His family was, his father died when he was nine. He was like the adult in this family. He came from a Buffalo, New York working class. He left, he never looked back either. And so it's kind of like he and I are both, people always say, you know, how we're such, I don't know, we get, the schools are always so grateful to us because we organize the state chess tournaments. He started the baseball league for this building. He does a lot of stuff, I do a lot of stuff. And it's simply because we're so grateful to have this family to be able to be a part of these kids' lives and to go to, I mean, he coaches baseball, he coaches basketball. We don't miss anything. It doesn't matter what it is,

 Basically what you need more is like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood.

 So that's just the sheer numbers of it, I think.

 tied up to a fence, you know. I think they deserve to die because the prisons and the overcrowding, that's a whole other subject. You know, that's just amazing to me, so many people are in there that should be dead, I feel, because we're just paying for them to live in there. 

Recording: (5912/ 9621) 
 Wow, yeah 

Recording: (5913/ 9621) 
 I don't know if that's what percolates. It's very different in the public schools than the Catholic school. In the public school, you have all the problems of society in the school. You have the drugs, you have the absentee parents, you have the delinquency. On the Catholic school, you don't have that. For one thing, it's oriented around the church, even though we're not Catholic, it's still oriented that, so there's a lot of values that permeates everything. Well, they don't do that in the public school because if you do that, somebody's gonna get ticked off, it's the wrong value and why are you doing this to my kid? So I think that's missing and that's a problem within the school, the public schools. So it just seems to be more distraction from the educational process. I mean, when you're in the Catholic school and you're in classroom, they deal with the discipline if they need to. Of course, part of the way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them back to the public schools. But in the public schools, you just have to deal with this all the time. And I think it's harder for the teachers to teach, because there's too much stuff in the way of what they really are there to do. 

Recording: (5914/ 9621) 
 I went to, let me see, I applied to Emory, Harvard, Duke, University of Chicago, and Washington University. So I got into three of those. They were neat places. 

Recording: (5915/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there was no property. 

Recording: (5916/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah.

 great

 And by the end of the first week or two, they were no longer scared of the magic box and we could continue to operating systems. The goal of learning operating systems is real simple. If you're playing with a computer and you screw something up, the worst thing you can possibly do is screw it up so badly that you have to start over.

 I don't even know what their holidays are. I don't know. 

Recording: (5920/ 9621) 
 I think so. Feels like it's too close to my mouth. 

Recording: (5921/ 9621) 
 I mean, I think that's the best way to address it. And as far as the homosexual, I think there is kids who say, well, maybe I'm gay. I don't know if I'm gay or what. Well, hopefully, they'll know their true identity eventually. 

Recording: (5922/ 9621) 
 Oh, most of it's horribly liberal. And they always find some way to misrepresent, like Kerwin. 

Recording: (5923/ 9621) 
 Indirectly, yes. 

Recording: (5924/ 9621) 
 This will be something good to get on your tape. And they've got people over there where I work at that they'll give them the days off if their cats are sick. 

Recording: (5925/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5926/ 9621) 
 No, I don't think it was because I grew up just basic, not even really Christian, just really no real religion. And I'd been going to Presbyterian church as I was about 19 years old, looking for something, a church. I just had a feeling that I wanted to have that in my life because I'd never had that before. And so I was just looking around, and I was open to anything. I'd listen to Eastern religions, and I've listened to the Jehovah's Witnesses. And then when I read in the Book of Mormon, it's a feeling of like I felt like I had heard it before, and it sense to me and so that's why I really felt at home with this and that's why I decided to 

Recording: (5927/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah.

 Well, that's probably the roof right there.

 I think. 

Recording: (5935/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm.

 It's great. Cause he's heavy, he's killing my back. Oh yeah, that's what everyone says, you think. 

Recording: (5939/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5940/ 9621) 
 But then there's a lot you know that they could do with that mall too that might make me even want to go there more. 

Recording: (5941/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5942/ 9621) 
 I haven't personally researched it, but I have seen, I would personally research it if I was president, documentaries and whatnot and things on 20-20, which I don't wholeheartedly believe just because it's on TV and they say it's so. But if it is true, and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it's on TV, that Three Stri strikes and you're out has really seemed to work in California because most of the people that are committing the violent crimes with guns or rapes or whatnot are doing most of the crime. So once they're locked up, yeah, it costs more money to house them for life, but they're saving so much because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore, so they don't have to catch them. They don't have to process them, et cetera. So I would really like to see that. And plus, I think once that really is in the works and really working and we really do what we're gonna say we're doing instead of like little parents, no, parents, no honey don't do that, no honey don't do that. You know what I mean? Because I think that's part of our problem too. 

Recording: (5943/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5944/ 9621) 
 Let's put it this way, when I was a kid, you didn't want to be brought home by the police. You were actually scared of the police. Nowadays, what's a kid scared of? Nothing. 

Recording: (5945/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (5946/ 9621) 
 I know that's why I wouldn't do the hiking thing. So I'm like, great, I can get like a visa. Because I had so many times, well, you know, you get some places in Europe, you might have some problems getting a tourist visa. Sometimes they work illegal. 

Recording: (5947/ 9621) 
 No, I haven't.

 you

 Just carrying around a gun and shooting someone. 

Recording: (5952/ 9621) 
 You know, it's a real word and you really have to think about it when you start getting there because it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you're going, oh, jeez, are we doing the right thing? But, you know, some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with, we sit down and talk about it and we're just like, I don't think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff, you know, and, you know, kept them entertained all day long by ourselves, you know. There's no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids, you know. They're all at daycare, you know. They just aren't around anymore. It's not the same anymore where, you know, every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff. So, you know, they've made a lot of friends through there and they still, the daughter who's in a different school still associates with friends that are in other school systems that she met at the daycare. 

Recording: (5953/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (5954/ 9621) 
 It counts if you're touching the ground or if something that you're sitting on is touching

 Oh yeah, herb. 

Recording: (5958/ 9621) 
 We have desks and lofted beds. 

Recording: (5959/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (5960/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5961/ 9621) 
 Definitely, it would be nice, but no. 

Recording: (5962/ 9621) 
 I don't care about having to do it. My mom even wants me to do hers over summer. I'm like, okay, fine. 

Recording: (5963/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5964/ 9621) 
 And no, oh, did they? 

Recording: (5965/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (5966/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I would like to have another job, but I would love to have a Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 job, never work another evening, a Saturday or a Sunday, if can be. I know I'll probably not be able to do that because OSU wants me to come back there as a contractor, so I don't know. 

Recording: (5967/ 9621) 
 And finally, I don't know whether—we had a Piper Cub observation plane. I don't know whether he saw him or who, but anyway, they finally figured that he was in a tunnel for the railroad.

 About 12.

 It was about a bunch of teenage ravers.

 It was Columbus. He went to Fort Hayes. 

Recording: (5975/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (5976/ 9621) 
 I don you know. It's the land of the free, alright. It's a free country, but it'll cost you. 

Recording: (5977/ 9621) 
 And you know, just sometimes it's just like, they're like, oh, well, she couldn't understand or something like that. But for the most part, I, there's, you know, no weirdness. He's had, he had a few cousins, you know, make some little comments, but. 

Recording: (5978/ 9621) 
 going to be a really busy day. And I would, the same thing at Port Columbus, you know, I'd see all these cars, but it would be just about the same traffic. And I'm like, and I mentioned to somebody, I go, where are the extra airplanes? And they go, they can't add extra airplanes. It's, they have certain routes they can do, they just have to put bigger airplanes on. So they said, you know, you'll see larger airplanes when it's holiday time so they can put more people on. So, 

Recording: (5979/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5980/ 9621) 
 it's better in terms of the city government seems to, the people seem to be more aware of what they're doing and it's not, oh well, I'll just do this. It's kind of like, you know, there's some brains down there. 

Recording: (5981/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5982/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (5983/ 9621) 
 I was only there for a couple weeks in the harbor. I never set foot on land.

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5985/ 9621) 
 So what was different about it? service winter quarter. I took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service because I needed some money and I love driving. And let me tell you, it's really, really different driving around in the big city compared to out in the country, man. I mean, you're flying down 71 or 70 through town and you go as fast as everybody else is going and if they're going 80, you're going 80. And if they're going 2, you're going 2. I mean, my dad, I brought him down to Columbus a few times, because my dad and I are real close. And I'm driving around, and I'll zip in between cars, and he's like, I forgot what it's like living in a city, because he used to live in Chicago. But that's one of the things I really enjoy. One of the things I don't like about living in a big city is, but I've gotten used to, but I don't like the fact that every time you look up in the night sky, all you see is this like orange haze. You can't see stars very well. The noise, I mean there's always noise. I remember last year living in the dorms, every morning at 2.30 in the morning, there was a trash truck that picked up some trash from a bar right behind where we lived. And I lived in Taylor, so it's in a T-shape, and this side of the building, all the sound just rolls right up the wall. And this trash truck made so much stinking noise. It was ridiculous. Every single morning at 2.30. I developed the ability to sleep through anything. And that's one of the fascinating things when I go home, dead silence. Dead silence. And that is now where I have a problem sleeping. Because there's no noise. There's no noise. I'm so used to turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound that I have the opposite thing. I can't go at night? got a special show coming in or not, but that's the place I really like going. They're open until usually 2.30, 2 o'clock, all depends. I also found something fascinating. I came to Columbus and raised in this really, really, really conservative, extremely Christian religious community of Ashland, and I came to Columbus and I started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals. And I have found some of the most fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals. And they're not nearly, they're not the evil people that everybody back home in our community always said they were. It's just like, these are normal people. I may not agree with what they're doing, but they're normal people. And I've met some really cool people who are homosexuals. And that, leading where that was going, we went to AXIS, which is one of the gay dance clubs in Columbus. It's on High Street. It's down in a German village. No, it's not. Is it down in

 I'm

 You know, they want to be judges like everybody else, but, you know, I think they have so many different ideas, and not that either one of them is right, but still, I think there's always going to be a barrier there. They're just kids, or just not all kids are going to get along, you know? I mean. 

Recording: (5988/ 9621) 
 my background. 

Recording: (5989/ 9621) 
 And you know, you have a hard thing there. But then if you teach the teachers that they're not going to be quiet and they're not going to, you know, look at this flattery. 

Recording: (5990/ 9621) 
 We haven't been there in a while, but I mean, we do go. 

Recording: (5991/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5992/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5993/ 9621) 
 And so it's the thing is though, it's almost like I'm really glad that willing to say I just can't make those. He let he let my daughter who's 13. He left left her at the movies one night. They went to the movies. There was no the movie they went to see was sold out. The next one wasn't going to start until 930, which means this kid's 12 years old. So that would have been 11, 312, you know, at the Lennox. He leaves her there with one of her friends, some boy, and although this is a tomboy who's just amazing. But so anyhow, he left her there. And they said they called me, but I was wearing the sweeper, so I didn't hear the phone. So left her there and he said that she was going to call back, you know, at a certain time and I was going to tell her what she could or couldn't do. So I said, you know, we're going to have to come here home. You know, he's going to have to come and get you. Oh,, we're not gonna do that. I you know, you can't be this late So he went back down picked him up and I said let the kid come to our house. He can come here until 11 

Recording: (5994/ 9621) 
 Oh 

Recording: (5995/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (5996/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (5997/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (5998/ 9621) 
 You know what I mean? 

Recording: (5999/ 9621) 
 The bad places the television things that they have on the programs they have on and I think that that's had a lot to do with changing our younger generation in a way they think the way they act what their morals are and I think that's why they're having more shootings in schools and The programs are terrible. I think that they need to really redo them. There's too much profanity. There's too much sex There's too much just do what I want. I got to do my own thing. That's what it... when the I want to do my own thing started he says with the women's feminist movement. And it probably did and it probably did have something to do with it. Because after all somebody speaking up and they want to do things my... well Bing Crosby who was it? No. 

Recording: (6000/ 9621) 
 There's the ones that'll get out there with their picket signs and raise hell. Okay. 

Recording: (6001/ 9621) 
 Ha ha! 

Recording: (6002/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly, and it's just ridiculous, but so many people don't seem to think that way. I do think, yeah, access, it would help if access were restricted, or at least if they were more careful about it. I mean, it seems like even the laws that there are in place now aren't necessarily followed, and you know, that kind of thing. 

Recording: (6003/ 9621) 
 Because they're so stylish. 

Recording: (6004/ 9621) 
 It's difficult. You feel alone a lot of the time. And I'm not as liberal as I used to be. I think with age, I get tempered a little bit, but still, tend to be a little more liberal. It doesn't matter who I vote for, they're gonna lose. And I just stay out of a lot of discussions. It was interesting, our mother raised us in a way that we were always allowed to discuss politics and religion, anything we wanted to. But she'd stop if it got to the point where we were getting physical or name calling or something like that. And it was long after I left home, actually, before I realized that not everybody's that way. Not everybody wants to hear your views. So I, particularly around my in-laws, they're very conservative of Southern Ohio, raised during the Depression, in a depressed area. So I learned, my mother-in-law took any time you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her. So I just learned not to say anything. Yeah. My father-in-law wasn't that way, but my mother-in-law was. 

Recording: (6005/ 9621) 
 Very different. There's been a lot of innovations. 

Recording: (6006/ 9621) 
 Um, I mean, fact of the matter is, if being gay is a genetic disorder, then that should have no effect on the kids because they should still be, uh, normal, I guess, or whatever you want to say. 

Recording: (6007/ 9621) 
 I hate life. 

Recording: (6008/ 9621) 
 Um, well, because my cousins and, uh, they all have a, they're very, you know, well-educated and they're more affluent. And I think that, uh, maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there. 

Recording: (6009/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6010/ 9621) 
 He found out he could just move. Yeah, so he always got away from that. 

Recording: (6011/ 9621) 
 Oh, you have to nowadays, you know. I don't understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife still does all the duties at home, plus has a full-time job. That just doesn't happen now. Now, you know, if your wife didn't work, you could expect these things, but she's doing 40 hours a week, too, so. It is. It's work, and it's a full-time job. They start, the seven-year- just brought it, here it is, the end of the year, second grade, she brings home this project, gonna have to have a book report, use three books of reference, you know, she's never done anything like this. It was the battle all weekend long, you know, getting this information out of her, you know, she had to pick an animal and do a whole report on it, she's gonna have to stand up in front of the class and make a box with a display in it, and I was still trying to figure out how to write it. already, that's all she writes in now. I mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe, might be learning something. Yeah, she's in fractions, she's doing fractions, she's doing percentages already in second grade. And I thought we were one plus one, two plus, you know in second grade it just seems like they're three years ahead. 

Recording: (6012/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6013/ 9621) 
 Later. Next. Afterward. 

Recording: (6014/ 9621) 
 So, I don't know, just lucky. 

Recording: (6015/ 9621) 
 And they end up okay anyway. That's good. 

Recording: (6016/ 9621) 
 아하... 

Recording: (6017/ 9621) 
 Well yeah, we got broke into I think twice and stuff got stolen. My truck's been broken into, my mom's car's been broken into, the gas siphon. Pretty much everybody around here's been criminalized one way or another. 

Recording: (6018/ 9621) 
 So it's kind of the mentality, if my parents did okay without it, then I don't need it. 

Recording: (6019/ 9621) 
 Hello. 

Recording: (6020/ 9621) 
 You know, how far they held responsible, I don't know. You'd have to go on a case-by-case basis. 

Recording: (6021/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6022/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6023/ 9621) 
 And I did have a very serious relationship in Florida. He was quite a bit younger than I was and I knew he wanted children and I never wanted children unfortunately. I love animals and things but I just never decided I never wanted children and I knew he eventually would. So I was engaged to him but I decided to 

Recording: (6024/ 9621) 
 Wow, I'm getting nervous. 

Recording: (6025/ 9621) 
 Uh-uh. 

Recording: (6026/ 9621) 
 The most part yeah, I mean obviously like they said they came out and said the Catholic Church Was against it, but at the same time like with research things like that where they're saying that it could be a mental disorder of some sorts Where I mean they couldn't can't so much really condemn it to to the point anymore that they used to 

Recording: (6027/ 9621) 
 But it's because most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage. So it's just that kind of thing. 

Recording: (6028/ 9621) 
 I don't know. Actually, probably if I went up there now, I would like it. But I don't like it as well as Columbus at all, mainly, I suppose, because of the university. 

Recording: (6029/ 9621) 
 Just, you know. 

Recording: (6030/ 9621) 
 but we really haven't talked about that. But my ex-wife's got family here, so she comes in about two or three weeks at least out of the summer. 

Recording: (6031/ 9621) 
 I heard about that, but the same principle applies. But I'm talking about just everyday things that people, you want to talk about children primarily, there is no penalty anymore. Parents are scared to death to pick one up and spank them, even with their bare hands, or to make them stand in a corner because they considered, and going back to the word, harassment, child abuse and harassment. Of consequence, and a penalty can be a very, very simple thing. A mother can simply look at Janie and say, Janie, you should not do that. 

Recording: (6032/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (6033/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, I think it's real important to really get a good feel for how you are and all your beliefs and all that. They have to really match. And if they don't, then it's not ever going to work because there's always going to be conflict and friction and all that kind of thing. So I think it's real important. And there's no age limit on that to when you really feel good about yourself and you really know what you want to do, then that's the only time that you can really commit and say, yeah, we do have a mutual thing. And young people, there's so many different infatuations to start with that they get blinded and they get off course and everything else. And then it doesn't stay the same. I mean, it's all exciting and all that. And then I think it's kind of, 

Recording: (6034/ 9621) 
 I blew a disc out. 

Recording: (6035/ 9621) 
 like not go out. Pretty much your TV's your entertainment for the year. 

Recording: (6036/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (6037/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (6038/ 9621) 
 when he died I was about 30. 

Recording: (6039/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6040/ 9621) 
 I know the valedictorian of Harvard, like in the junior class. 

Recording: (6041/ 9621) 
 Yeah, much too fast for me. 

Recording: (6042/ 9621) 
 connecting. Some wires are crossed up here or something. And so they become very distrustful of adults because all their life people have been saying, 

Recording: (6043/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6044/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6045/ 9621) 
 that encompasses the theory that all things happen for a reason. Even though it seems like it's chaos, even though it seems like it's an accident, there's a flow of spirit in this world. Things are moving at a pace that they're supposed to move at, and things happen. And death is part of life, physical death. And that's one of the things I also learned through this was that you don't die. You don't. Physically, maybe. You know, there's no denying that. But spiritually, not even physical death can break that. It won't. 

Recording: (6046/ 9621) 
 Friday nights are date night. 

Recording: (6047/ 9621) 
 And... 

Recording: (6048/ 9621) 
 Damn, what a problem. Don't you wish you had those kind of problems, huh? 

Recording: (6049/ 9621) 
 They had this little apartment. She's from India. 

Recording: (6050/ 9621) 
 And do you like that? 

Recording: (6051/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6052/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6053/ 9621) 
 He likes meat too. 

Recording: (6054/ 9621) 
 which could change. 

Recording: (6055/ 9621) 
 Just a job. That's an awesome job. 

Recording: (6056/ 9621) 
 I think it's fair. I think it should be that domestic partners should be covered. I think there should probably be some restrictions. There should be some level of 

Recording: (6057/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we had a, my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds. 

Recording: (6058/ 9621) 
 Did I think that we would be ready? 

Recording: (6059/ 9621) 
 You know, he had... 

Recording: (6060/ 9621) 
 And it's not. 

Recording: (6061/ 9621) 
 you know when he's up at night I have to do it. It's my responsibility now. And I mean people think that you know, oh you get a lot of help. No. They have their lives, I have mine. 

Recording: (6062/ 9621) 
 Didn't have it done through ceremony, nothing like that. And even the man that he followed for a while is sitting in a rest home over in South Dakota now, because he's old. He's on his way out. And he was a road man, gave his life for 89 tribes to help them find and re-find their connection with their spirituality that they'd lost because of the missionaries bringing Christianity. 

Recording: (6063/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my best friend lives outside Canberra and she has a lot of medical problems. 

Recording: (6064/ 9621) 
 I was exposed to a lot of men who were not brought up as I was, but there were a lot of them that were. 

Recording: (6065/ 9621) 
 names. I actually read a story in some book about this black lady that was having like her ninth and tenth kid and she didn't know what, she had twins and she didn't know what to name them and she'd run out of names that she liked so they brought her lunch in to her and the nurse jokingly said or the aide or something, well just pick a couple names off the menu. So she named them Limongelo and Arangelo, Lemongelo, Orangejello. She picked Lemongelo, Orangejello and turned them into Limongelo and Arangelo. Denise and Denefue. 

Recording: (6066/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6067/ 9621) 
 You know, technically there's insanity and there isn't insanity, but in my opinion, there is nobody who ever killed anybody who isn't insane. And just to knock them out is not appropriate. They need to be, we need to try to save them. I mean, not in the terms of a Christian saving, but to make them work that off and face it and come in their own mind to their own guilt. And so I've got two sides to that. One's they need to work because they did it, and the other side is if we keep, I believe in the reincarnation, the law of cause and effect, and if a person murders somebody, they will pay for that later. There's no question about that in the next life. But also I think that they should be made to face their guilt and what they've done, and a lot of them don't. They say that hardened criminals, real hard criminals, will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to, they need to. 

Recording: (6068/ 9621) 
 to get them thinking about it. Then they'll start to notice it in their real life and once they start noticing it, they'll start getting more and more into it. 

Recording: (6069/ 9621) 
 Don't say, oh well, your son's gonna be gay, he's two right now, let's, you know, change this so it doesn't come out to be a problem or whatever. But, I mean, I think they need to leave that to the decision of the people. 

Recording: (6070/ 9621) 
 is 

Recording: (6071/ 9621) 
 You can't be mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle. Life's too short. You can love them either way. It doesn't make any difference. 

Recording: (6072/ 9621) 
 Right, same way with kids. If you have a penalty for them, they'll learn their lesson. But it's also the parent that has to set the example. And there's too many older folks right now, I don't think, because of two people had to work outside the house. They get home, they're aggravated, they're upset. Somebody else had their kids all day. And it's terrible that the situation's got that way. But I do believe that the older people, including our people and everybody that's at the top has to set the example and stick with it. 

Recording: (6073/ 9621) 
 As he was speaking and as he started to speak, I realized too another thing that I really feel has a tremendous impression on how we as people are doing here, but how the politicians are, is because the world in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better. And all these other countries and us are just like, oh, one country anymore or something. And I think that's had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people. 

Recording: (6074/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (6075/ 9621) 
 Now that was up to age 18 too or there about too. I think that the, you said you get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten and so forth. Well, that's the family. I think that we, in our educational program, we really need to start teaching what I call the older values, but good values. I don't care whether they're old or new, but good values. And I think we really need to have that established within our educational system, starting in the elementary, right on up through college. I think there ought to be a number of courses that are devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and assist in teaching, but I think that many of the courses, other courses ought to have elements within them that are teaching value, family values. I could even go so far as to say in chemistry or botany or psychology, any one of those, those are specialized subjects, but I think there are elements that they can have within each one of those talking about family value, family value, and that will help then permeate the entire society. But it's got to start back here in the first, and I think 

Recording: (6076/ 9621) 
 And sooner or later, you know, all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service, I guarantee you, they went in it with the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference. But once they get in there, it's such a bureaucracy. 

Recording: (6077/ 9621) 
 And it's not just like one group of people. 

Recording: (6078/ 9621) 
 that that is what's making these kids think they can do it. I just really think. 

Recording: (6079/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6080/ 9621) 
 Oh, you do know? 

Recording: (6081/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6082/ 9621) 
 in English. 

Recording: (6083/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so I have experience in that and I'm thankful that it was always a peaceful sort of thing. Although, what's going on inside your head and your body isn't that peaceful. 

Recording: (6084/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (6085/ 9621) 
 for example, so you should name her Tamara. 

Recording: (6086/ 9621) 
 I have just the same opinion I think most people have as a TV. 

Recording: (6087/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (6088/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6089/ 9621) 
 WITH THAT BOY. 

Recording: (6090/ 9621) 
 Pots never been associated with any kind of a crime that were some violent crime. 

Recording: (6091/ 9621) 
 Right! 

Recording: (6092/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (6093/ 9621) 
 But then you have a choice there. You would not necessarily have, you should have had more self-control and not had the child. Don't expect me to pay for your lack of willpower. That is a selfish attitude. That's stealing as well. 

Recording: (6094/ 9621) 
 I see no. 

Recording: (6095/ 9621) 
 In a way, yeah, I think that would be good. Yeah, maybe a new name. 

Recording: (6096/ 9621) 
 Well, you know, the crime you can't really stop and other things that happen. Just, you know, too much partying around. I mean, that's why I left 12th Avenue, because I couldn't, you know. But, you know, just everybody, the neighbors being loud and everything. My mom's older, so she can't really put up with any of that. 

Recording: (6097/ 9621) 
 I'm just kind of appalled at what they put on the news anyway. It's not usually what I consider news. It's a lot of human interest stories and things like that, which... 

Recording: (6098/ 9621) 
 Really? And it's bizarre. 

Recording: (6099/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I mean I like Florida just because it's not cold and it's it's really nice, but it rains a lot I mean and I don't I mean I'd rather live out west because it's like a dry heat as opposed to being I mean It's nice that it's 90 degrees, but it's not nice. It's like 90% humidity. I mean that's kind of that kind of sucks, but It's just different to live in Florida and how you think of Florida being is real different. I like it because the drivers aren't so insane like they are here. People are a little bit more laid back just because, I don't know, in parts it is really insane, but sometimes people just like, because it's nice weather, people don't get so aggravated by like here It's like cold and gray and you just want to like Yell at people in their car and suffer something. I don't know. I don't know if you'll steal this I 

Recording: (6100/ 9621) 
 basically, because the plans which the utilities had for our location, they could not provide to us because of the divestiture ruling. So we had to go out and do our own surveys, become self-educated through courses, through ATT and through Purdue University it was, I think OU had some courses. And ultimately the university here now has I think a major in telecommunication group. But the project, basically, we were going from putting together a network itself. And we had, you think of a party line system, or they used to call it daisy chain in the industry. You had to wait and wait for your turn to get onto a data network. And we got down to the point where we went to a spoke network, where everyone had a dedicated pipe. 

Recording: (6101/ 9621) 
 Well, I've been, see I wasn't much, being here and my daughter being there, I didn't really have the time with her that I wish I would have had, you know, but her mother, you know, did her all right and everything, but I wish I would have been more involved in her growing up. And I think two people families are generally better, you know, for not necessarily living, being married and everything, 

Recording: (6102/ 9621) 
 Sean is in, yeah. We don't have enough saxophones. Sure, we could use you. 

Recording: (6103/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my brother, well, he's the oldest oldest, but two sisters pretty much all the ones I really care about. Two sisters and their husbands. 

Recording: (6104/ 9621) 
 well. 

Recording: (6105/ 9621) 
 Eh, it wasn't anything too huge. I think it had about 1,200 people in it or so. 

Recording: (6106/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like a lot of people, I don't know why a lot of people go, but with a lot of people I know it's like, go to hear really good music. And it's amazing what happens, you know, people together, people dancing together, you look out and everybody's dancing. And the music's really good and everybody's really into it and working. 

Recording: (6107/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6108/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6109/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6110/ 9621) 
 Most people I associate with in this and that are a lot more involved with their kids than say our parents were as kids. 

Recording: (6111/ 9621) 
 Ha! 

Recording: (6112/ 9621) 
 But you know that there and goes back to you know the quality of the quantity I mean obviously this poor kid you know apparently was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs in the basement to you know to figure out some way of reaching his Nirvana or whatever you know and then his parents didn't have a clue or if they did they didn't care you know 

Recording: (6113/ 9621) 
 but at the same time it's not like they had the intent to do it so I can't see anything too incredibly severe but I mean I almost think it should be considered basically child neglect, things like that basically the same penalties that you'd run into for that but I mean they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kid has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 

Recording: (6114/ 9621) 
 Oh yes, definitely in England too. 

Recording: (6115/ 9621) 
 to heat in. 

Recording: (6116/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so, and a lot of people turn 18 when they're in high school, so I'm sure they can go get one there. 

Recording: (6117/ 9621) 
 All right, let's begin. 

Recording: (6118/ 9621) 
 Yes, I do. But I try to visit at least every two years. Either we go to New York or we meet halfway. A couple years ago we met at Penn State. And so, you know, the older ones, they're all dying off though. 

Recording: (6119/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6120/ 9621) 
 Yeah, 84. 

Recording: (6121/ 9621) 
 Oh, it's just so, the environment of course is incredibly beautiful. And everybody is more, I think, more open or more receptive to relationships. And, you know, I think it's a much friendlier place. And then I just think the vibrations are higher out there. You just don't have poverty. Well, if anybody's in poverty in Oregon, it's because they've chosen to live a simple life. It's not because they can't get jobs and things like that. Although the economy in Oregon is not that great, but they say in Eugene that even the dishwashers have PhDs. Well, the level of the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country. 

Recording: (6122/ 9621) 
 Are there other important roles? Where would those nuns be? Where would your mother possibly have been if she went to Catholic school, I take it? Where would she have been if it weren't for the nuns? Why we put nuns down? Hey, they worked a lot less than your mother is even getting compensated for. And they had a very important role for your development, even though your generation is removed. 

Recording: (6123/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. And the funny thing about that is if I heard one of those songs once, I might not be that turned off by it. But if you're going to play it at me, you know, six times in three hours. 

Recording: (6124/ 9621) 
 I heard something the other day that really upset me. I was at this convention downtown, the convention center, and one of the ladies that was presenting one of the workshops is a college professor in English at one of the Ohio colleges, and she said when she started teaching in 1985, they would always, she teaches writing, technical writing for people to do when they get out into the industry world, reports and stuff. She said they used to say, gear your writing to a person who's in the eighth grade. 

Recording: (6125/ 9621) 
 That's great. 

Recording: (6126/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6127/ 9621) 
 Well, actually, I've picked up a part-time job just in the past month or two. So I'm working for a research firm just for the convenience of the hours. I want to go back into the nursing field, but right now I just can't take that much time away because it would be at least an eight-hour shift. And I don't think that we're ready for that yet. He's a teacher. He works at a high school, yeah. He teaches ninth and tenth graders 10 years, do you ever think my kids are experiencing. I didn't know about whatever until I was much, much older. I didn't worry about that when I was that age. It's kind of scary. 

Recording: (6128/ 9621) 
 And they're not the kind that would go out and just shoot an animal. They would use it for food. I know one time that they gave it to a family that didn't have any money and didn't have any food. They went and killed some animals and gave it to them. I don't have a problem with that. But my brother-in-law is very much opposed to any kind of gun control. He believes whatever Charlton Heston tells him. 

Recording: (6129/ 9621) 
 I think my grandpa goes to church. 

Recording: (6130/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6131/ 9621) 
 I mean. 

Recording: (6132/ 9621) 
 And he travels all over the state of Ohio. 

Recording: (6133/ 9621) 
 Ah, wow. 

Recording: (6134/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6135/ 9621) 
 And unfortunately, they didn't really prove anything except that death is final. 

Recording: (6136/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (6137/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6138/ 9621) 
 You, you, why are you be doing eight children? 

Recording: (6139/ 9621) 
 I think it would probably, I think it would be certainly interesting. 

Recording: (6140/ 9621) 
 Yes, and no like I said, I think the average person is pretty decent person. I mean, I don't think there's Anything violent or there's anything wrong with them? But at the same time it's just the media focuses on the ones that are out of control and makes a big deals of The ones that are out of control and I think that's sort of what people pick up the perception to be I mean they don't they don't show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school is like volunteering at like the local senior citizens home or something like that. 

Recording: (6141/ 9621) 
 but I mean like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience, you know, objective ways. 

Recording: (6142/ 9621) 
 Because I don't know, it just was like if I get pregnant, I get pregnant. You don't know of what you really have to go through of having a baby, you know? Because I guess I really didn't care. If I got pregnant, I got pregnant. It didn't really register in my mind that this will not ruin, but it will change your whole life. 

Recording: (6143/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6144/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6145/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and it just didn't work. 

Recording: (6146/ 9621) 
 It's in northern Ohio. It's near Illyria, which is west of Cleveland. 

Recording: (6147/ 9621) 
 I'm just gonna try with it. 

Recording: (6148/ 9621) 
 And I know that in my case, I'll use a personal case, I'll use Frank, my older son. The ones I'm speaking of, the boys going on 17, the one little girl just turned 11, the other one turned 8. Well, they go over to the one grandparent's house, and she has a habit of paying them for little jobs they do around the house. So consequently, when they come to my house, 

Recording: (6149/ 9621) 
 And the second tornado, it wasn't as bad. I mean, we was driving up after he ripped me off. And he said, well, I'm taking your sorry ass back to Columbus. And I said, OK, go for it. I'm just sitting there smiling all the way up, knowing what he didn't know. We get to Tennessee, and the weather's kind of bad there, too. I'm like, hey, man, slow down. You don't have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm. 

Recording: (6150/ 9621) 
 Girls, I've never seen them take a guy out of a bar. 

Recording: (6151/ 9621) 
 Heh heh heh heh heh. 

Recording: (6152/ 9621) 
 They more or less buy a dog for a token 

Recording: (6153/ 9621) 
 Well, I guess I'd have to say I don't necessarily like middle school. But see, when you get a special ed certificate, you're certified kindergarten through 12th. So I did several years in the high school when I was first out of college. I did high school first. Then I went to elementary while my kids were in elementary so I could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning, you know? And then six years ago I went to the middle school and I've decided that I'm too old to keep up with these kids. Not only are they learning disability and ADD, but they're middle schoolers and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies. You can't tell which is the hormones and which is the ADD and which is the learning disability. But like I said, I only have two more years to go, so I guess I can live through that. 

Recording: (6154/ 9621) 
 I think it's better probably if they don't have you say anything about it, you know. And most of the people, you know, like when you get to, I lived in the barracks all the time, but I mean, you know, a lot of people, you know, they get their own places off base, you know. Who cares what they, I mean, I don't care, you know. Like I say, I have gay friends that, you know, I don't care what they do. I mean, they're old enough to do whatever the heck they wanna do, you know. 

Recording: (6155/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (6156/ 9621) 
 Short North, it's in the Short North. But it's so much fun. It's absolutely so much fun because it's really weird. You normally don't get hit on by girls when you go to a regular dance club, but when you go to AXIS, you don't get hit on by girls, you get hit on by guys. I dance with Glowsticks, and I've had like seven guys come up to me in one night, and they're just like, can you do that for me? 

Recording: (6157/ 9621) 
 We have fun. 

Recording: (6158/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6159/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6160/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he wants to teach. He likes football and he wants to coach football, but you have to teach to do that. 

Recording: (6161/ 9621) 
 hear and now that's the most newsworthy story out there. So I think yeah, the press have a lot to do with it, the media. 

Recording: (6162/ 9621) 
 It's an ego trip, that's all it is, basically. It's like, look, I can do this. 

Recording: (6163/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (6164/ 9621) 
 Oh my gosh. It was just unbelievable. He got really sick after that rush week. Yeah, really sick. So they wanted him to move in the fraternity house. He can't really afford it. But they just sent me a really nice letter saying he's like in the top of their chapter academically and everything. So I'm thinking they might help him out a little bit. They want him in the house real bad. 

Recording: (6165/ 9621) 
 Basically, it's just the talk and stuff. It's not like, you know what I mean, I'm black, I'm better, or I'm white, I'm better. It's none of that. 

Recording: (6166/ 9621) 
 Yum. 

Recording: (6167/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's gone downhill a lot. 

Recording: (6168/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6169/ 9621) 
 And if you know any teenagers, the more strict you make it, the more they rebel. 

Recording: (6170/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6171/ 9621) 
 I, from my perspective, which is skewed of course, to me I think it just seems that way. I mean, we're only talking about 10 cases, that's not very many. I mean, you could by coincidence have them all be African American. If I were African American, I think I would have a different perspective. And I don't live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police. So I'm not in touch with that situation. 

Recording: (6172/ 9621) 
 So if you can bring any pets, but say if you had a dog, could you bring it back to the states? So you have to leave all those. 

Recording: (6173/ 9621) 
 Well, we went in at Naples. 

Recording: (6174/ 9621) 
 Nope. 

Recording: (6175/ 9621) 
 Oh, well, we really wants to go. He lived in California. That's where that family I told you about was. And when he was 14 or 16, and he really wants to go back. So we'll probably end up there sometime. But after I finish school and after he works for a little while and I work and so that we can have enough money. I mean, we don't need to have a ton, but we just should be at least a little out of debt. Yeah, something. 

Recording: (6176/ 9621) 
 It's just. 

Recording: (6177/ 9621) 
 So I'm like. 

Recording: (6178/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (6179/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (6180/ 9621) 
 We have definitely made some progress in that direction. I still think that there's considerable progression that needs to be made. I was just talking to someone a couple weeks ago who's a fellow history major, and her, and actually her brother's a fellow history major too, and a friend of mine, I don't know him all that well, but apparently her family, I mean, she's double major in history and chemistry. She plans to go to med school. Her parents, her family supports her in this, but they've made it painfully clear that she shouldn't plan on having a career because she's gonna have to raise children at some point, which is, that's not the way things should work, in my belief. And the fact that it's like the males telling the daughter, this is how things need to be. I think an individual should have the choice. But I feel, I'm concerned about this push to the right that's sort of going on, hoping it's sort of dying out. But I mean, it seemed a little scarier back in like 94, 95. But I think we've reached a point where, because not all of the advances have been 100% successful, the opposition is criticizing the advance 

Recording: (6181/ 9621) 
 But when he did have something to do with it, it was kind of strange. They'd go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that. 

Recording: (6182/ 9621) 
 The big things. 

Recording: (6183/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (6184/ 9621) 
 Yeah, pretty much. 

Recording: (6185/ 9621) 
 the 

Recording: (6186/ 9621) 
 Well the main thing is they never leave. They go, a lot of them, through their senior year and graduate. Ohio State has the lowest GPA of any college. 

Recording: (6187/ 9621) 
 So, but I had some really tough, challenging jobs. And yeah, if I knew now what I knew then, I probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of different, yeah, experience with sexual harassment. 

Recording: (6188/ 9621) 
 Oh, well, in Oregon, well, I was down in California for three months and I went to the produce stand and I took my umbrella and of course, it doesn't rain too much in California. And I said, oh, I'm from Oregon and I always think it's going to rain. And he said, well, I'm from Washington and I know it's going to rain. 

Recording: (6189/ 9621) 
 So if you want to give me two more minutes to play. Okay, now you got another leg. But the thing is, let me ask you a question. How does that impact you if you can't be a priest? Aren't there other important quote-unquote roles for women in the church? Aren't there other important roles? 

Recording: (6190/ 9621) 
 on the spur of the moment. I'd have to think about that. I really would. 

Recording: (6191/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (6192/ 9621) 
 It's like hitting me and I just, I'm not sure. You can tell me if it's not anywhere near my mouth. 

Recording: (6193/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (6194/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I want to. I just don't do it. 

Recording: (6195/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6196/ 9621) 
 Yeah. The media exposure. 

Recording: (6197/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (6198/ 9621) 
 Didn't like it, huh? 

Recording: (6199/ 9621) 
 It's like you're doing interviews. 

Recording: (6200/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6201/ 9621) 
 Right, right, right. 

Recording: (6202/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and then I'll show that son of a gun, I'll shoot him. Like the guys that were supposed to be picking him. I don't even know whether he even shot him then. But yeah, I think they kind of just thought, I'll prove to them that they can't push me around. 

Recording: (6203/ 9621) 
 But Northland Mall is where I do go shopping. 

Recording: (6204/ 9621) 
 What the hell am I doing here? 

Recording: (6205/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (6206/ 9621) 
 I think I would say the same thing because of course we had the benefit of having a mother who was very giving. I mean I think I learned a lot from her selflessness. 

Recording: (6207/ 9621) 
 Why is that? 

Recording: (6208/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6209/ 9621) 
 In what way? 

Recording: (6210/ 9621) 
 No. What really, when AIDS started, I had a, one of my best friend's brother had died of it. And that really, after that I like, you know, was like, I have to wear condoms. Because I was scared to death to get AIDS. You know, so I did wear condoms, you know, probably after a few years of having sex without condoms. 

Recording: (6211/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6212/ 9621) 
 I've been playing video games since I was two. 

Recording: (6213/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (6214/ 9621) 
 It's magnified and or yeah, they have that choice. They can say well listen You don't understand and blah blah blah and I've tried that But the best I can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen I hear what you're saying, but I'm trying to show you that and tell you how I work best so as long as you can try not to dictate to me and allow me some freedom and Give me goals of what you want to accomplish and give me the freedom to accomplish in the way that I can do it Not by quotas and deadlines and crap like that I can show you what to do and that's's the struggle I'm having right now, trying to find employment where people will cut me some slack. And I wanted to do some driving, but, you know, because at least out on the road, I don't have to put up with anyone's crap. But long drive and long distances is not good for me, focusing, concentrating. And I've had several accidents, several tickets. So, I mean, I've even had two other head injuries. 

Recording: (6215/ 9621) 
 No, that's true. 

Recording: (6216/ 9621) 
 But I can certainly see that. I think that a lot of people feel like too, he's one of us. He's like we are. Well, Michigan, it's a 10 year mandatory jail time sentence if you get caught with any cocaine at all. 

Recording: (6217/ 9621) 
 And that's pretty much the way I felt the whole day, because I was just smiling on the inside. 

Recording: (6218/ 9621) 
 Ehh? 

Recording: (6219/ 9621) 
 I am. 

Recording: (6220/ 9621) 
 Bye! 

Recording: (6221/ 9621) 
 and the battle at Fallen Timbers. Here's my rough draft. Would you fix it for me before I make my final copy so I'll get a good grade? See, I tell them. I say, that's what I'm here for. You know, I'm here to help you. Use me to help you get better grades. Use me to run interference. If you think you know the science, but you're getting marked down because you can't spell the words, let me know. I'll go talk to your science teacher. Tell her not to count your spelling or not, you know, not to make you take the test without the little spell checker thing that's in your book bag to let you use that. I mean, I do a lot of what I call advocating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that don't understand. I go in and I say, well, you know, this is kind of a long test. Could he maybe take half today and half tomorrow? Or would you mind if he came out to my room ninth period during study hall? Because I have a free period and I could like kind of monitor it and read the words he doesn't know so that he's actually answering what the question really says instead of what he thinks it says. So that you won't be testing his reading ability, but you'll really be testing whether he knows about magnetism. 

Recording: (6222/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure if I'm paying attention. 

Recording: (6223/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6224/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6225/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6226/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and then I went to work before that. I had to walk from Hilliard one day through, matter of fact, through this 12th Avenue stretch right there. 

Recording: (6227/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6228/ 9621) 
 to get them to do what they do to even help blind people or to help people that have other physical disabilities. You can tell from the way the dog is in terms of the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability that they've been trained for. You can tell whether they've been trained the right way or whatever. So I thought about that, but you know, I haven't given them much more than just a thought, but I looked at a veterinary assistant and I went in there and it wasn't, I was there just for a half a day and they were telling me about some of these people out there that, you know, I don't understand the law again, but, you know, there's people out there that'll go out and they'll buy a dog, you know, a nice dog, because they don't want to make the time to train it and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time and discipline and love and care just like a child. 

Recording: (6229/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (6230/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Of course, you know, babies tend not to be on time. 

Recording: (6231/ 9621) 
 It's still on, but I don't know. 

Recording: (6232/ 9621) 
 And then she's the one that I'll be hearing, you know, you don't know what they're like, black ass and all this, you know, they're prejudiced. And all she's doing is yelling about being prejudiced, their prejudice against her. Because, boy, she don't understand, that's her damn job. 

Recording: (6233/ 9621) 
 You're much bigger and you can control the thing and keep it away from her. Yeah, but I don't want somebody else telling me what they can watch and not watch. That's my job. But I don't know how, I mean, the media, supposedly, I mean, this may be the way it works. The media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it or whatever, they don't. But it's when it's like the constant barrage that this is what you get, the Monica Lewinsky stuff. Every day there was a new twist on this story that, or the news was that there wasn't a news twist. Yeah, I don't care. But you couldn't turn it off because that's all that was on. 

Recording: (6234/ 9621) 
 and started playing MP3s. 

Recording: (6235/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. And the university knows that's going on. 

Recording: (6236/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (6237/ 9621) 
 It got out of control. 

Recording: (6238/ 9621) 
 Ah, it's good. 

Recording: (6239/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6240/ 9621) 
マスク 

Recording: (6241/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (6242/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6243/ 9621) 
 two years. 

Recording: (6244/ 9621) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (6245/ 9621) 
 the city just could not believe. 

Recording: (6246/ 9621) 
 And, you know, it's, oh, you've got art? We're open to that, you know. 

Recording: (6247/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6248/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it worked out fine for us. 

Recording: (6249/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's really not something you see in Worthington. 

Recording: (6250/ 9621) 
 But see his father lived right around the corner and never even had nothing to do with them. 

Recording: (6251/ 9621) 
 I mean, soon, like, FedEx and all that's probably going to be, there's probably going to be no one working there. They're probably going to make it all machinery, you know. 

Recording: (6252/ 9621) 
 which is pretty well to the south end of Italy. We went up through the mountains. We didn't see—well, we went up to—let's see now. Well, we went about halfway up to between Naples and Rome. 

Recording: (6253/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (6254/ 9621) 
 I don't know anything about it, but he lived in Lompoc, which is, I think it's near Santa Barbara, but we've talked about LA. I don't know anything. I've heard terrible things about it. 

Recording: (6255/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (6256/ 9621) 
 At this point, I blame it on the administration. And the citizens of Columbus haven't, I mean, two years ago or was it three years ago now, they defeated a levy. You should never defeat a school levy. 

Recording: (6257/ 9621) 
 That makes it hard if you got a family. You want to spend a night out on the town with your family man. That kind of blows your whole budget for the year. 

Recording: (6258/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they'll just take one scripture and they'll expand it. And they'll just run with that one scripture. And then there are also churches that will just delete, in their minds, they'll delete certain sections of the scripture that they don't like. First Corinthians chapter 12 talks about spiritual gifts. And that's one of the big things that I'm into down here in Columbus, and the fact that they still exist, like healing people and spiritual gifts like healing people and the extremely taboo religious topic among a lot of churches is the gift of tongues. Whether it's dead, whether it's not, whether it's inspired, whether it's not inspired, yada yada, blah blah. Well, I hadn't even heard about it until I got to Columbus because, and I know the Bible pretty well, and I hadn't even heard about it until I got to Columbus. And I get to Columbus and I'm like, okay this is pretty cool. I went home and I'm talking to some people in my parents church and they're like, oh yeah, we just don't really talk about that very often. And I'm just 

Recording: (6259/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they'd just kick him to the hallway. He was either in the hallway or in the office. And the nuns would say, oh, we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions. 

Recording: (6260/ 9621) 
 And I couldn't walk at all. 

Recording: (6261/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (6262/ 9621) 
 If you can't play, you won't learn. You'll just sit there and follow my directions and that's dumb. 

Recording: (6263/ 9621) 
 He cleans his. 

Recording: (6264/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we had any, not really, just modest dresses. You couldn't wear pants. And dresses couldn't be ankle length. They couldn't be at the knee. It had to be mid-knee, or whatever that is, calf. And that was certain restrictions. But yeah, I mean, basically just modest, whatever. I mean, I wear boots with the dress in Russia. 

Recording: (6265/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6266/ 9621) 
 Oh, there always has been. There always has been. I think a lot of people feel that kids, a lot of kids are on medication today that shouldn't be. But I think that's the fault of the school or the parents or some doctor that, like for example, when we refer kids in Worthington to a doctor, we have a list of three doctors that we work with. And we know that they won't just give this kid a pill if he doesn't have eight out of the 12 symptoms or whatever. So we refer them to those doctors. And then if this doctor, those doctors are pretty conservative too. And if they put them on meds, it's usually just for the school day, not during the summer, not over vacation, not after five o'clock, not on the weekends. And it's just to help them focus. And then these doctors also ask for reports back from the teachers. And if you don't see any appreciable difference in two or three weeks, then you take the kid off and you try something else. And some kids, medication is like the difference between night and day. You go back in, observe the kid, you can't believe it's the same kid. Other kids, dead and face them, they might as well be drinking a glass of water. Well, since they have side effects, like they stunt your growth and they subdue your appetite and some of the other, you know, some kids get headaches from dexedrine and Adderall. So I say, you know, if it works, use it. If it doesn't work, just forget it. But, you know, a lot of people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because they're maybe just not able to pay attention a little bit, but they're not really ADD, and the parents are taking them in and going, Johnny's not getting straight A's. Put him on something. So, I guess 

Recording: (6267/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (6268/ 9621) 
 I like it. I've only lived in the northern end. I've lived in Dublin and Old Worthington and now Hilliard, which is kind of around the side. But I like it because it has its own little, well, especially Worthington, its own little city within a city. 

Recording: (6269/ 9621) 
 20 years ago. 

Recording: (6270/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6271/ 9621) 
 Well he uses it when he has like car problems or something he tends to like to drive his own car. You know they have to park so far away. 

Recording: (6272/ 9621) 
 It's not going to work. 

Recording: (6273/ 9621) 
 Yeah, probably, because we have some public systems. Most of them are for the librarians, but there's some for public too. 

Recording: (6274/ 9621) 
 I love you. 

Recording: (6275/ 9621) 
 I think when you have two or more pets, you have to make a little bit more effort. 

Recording: (6276/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was pretty much upper middle class. 

Recording: (6277/ 9621) 
 I wonder if that's also a socialized medicine there. It is socialized, isn't it? 

Recording: (6278/ 9621) 
 which was a going thing. 

Recording: (6279/ 9621) 
 I have a class at high school that is called grads and it's like all the kids in there are people that have kids. 

Recording: (6280/ 9621) 
 I've got nothing against Christianity, but I got something against the way it was brought here. 

Recording: (6281/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. 

Recording: (6282/ 9621) 
 Well, they needed to strike, don't get me wrong. That's not the stupid part. But the part was, the majority of them saying that they were here for 10 years and they ain't making that much money. Most people would move on. 

Recording: (6283/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well, the white man would probably win, but the black man also has a better chance than the woman, I think. 

Recording: (6284/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6285/ 9621) 
 them. 

Recording: (6286/ 9621) 
 You know what, actually, I don't believe they have anything booked so far. A lot of times, I think this year people are more going out rather than having people come into their homes and things. I've usually, I've worked for different hotels where I've always worked on New Year's Eve. And my husband this year is like, you know, but we don't even have any plans. We were gonna maybe do something with some friends and they're going to California. So I'm not sure even exactly what I'm gonna do. But right now there's not an event scheduled. 

Recording: (6287/ 9621) 
 No, no, really, I mean, different cultures and everything. I went to school with blacks, so I mean, that wasn't that big a thing, except for the influx of the, you know, I didn't realize how many were being drafted or being enlisted into the service at the time and everything, or how many actually were even in the country, you know. 

Recording: (6288/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6289/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6290/ 9621) 
 And I mean, yeah, if they find the cause of it, whatever, that's good. But at the same time, the cause of it doesn't really matter. I mean, the fact of the matter is it's there. They have to deal with it. 

Recording: (6291/ 9621) 
 Media has a lot of control over people, but I believe that sometimes people just need a kick like that. 

Recording: (6292/ 9621) 
 They did. 

Recording: (6293/ 9621) 
 See, the thing is, ideally, I would rather, if I were gonna buy houses in Clintonville, to hold them and rent them. My problem is, I don't have any money, so that down payment has to be 10% down. And so that means that I would have that tied up while I was being rented. Like, we bought a couple condos over on Bethel Road for my kids to live in. So my oldest girl, when she was getting ready to move out, she was like 24, and they couldn't find any place to live that I felt was safe and that was acceptable. So I finally decided, well, we'll find something and I'll buy it and I'll be your landlady, and then it'll be nice. And so I bought that one, and then my other daughter was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school and changed her mind, so I just rented that one. But the bottom line is, I just got a second mortgage and I have a guy that I work with that helped me buy those without any money. I didn't have a down payment, I had nothing. So it's like I can afford to hang on to those because the rent just makes the payment. But the other, you would be fine, you'd be running, you wouldn't buy anything that you didn't think you could rent and come out even with. 

Recording: (6294/ 9621) 
 You know, I just got out of it. 

Recording: (6295/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and immigration from different countries. And those people come in and they've got their input. And I think that it's just a mixture of everything. 

Recording: (6296/ 9621) 
 and don't insult us anymore or we'll go to trial. So my attorney jumped it back up to $125,000. I couldn't take sitting there, these guys going back and forth of what they felt I was worth. Even the arbitrator was an asshole. But that's the way that system works. 

Recording: (6297/ 9621) 
 Okay, my name is, I am an undergrad, double major in German and history, currently working on a senior honors thesis in history. I will be graduating next quarter after a grand total of six years as an undergrad, an impressive, somewhat disturbing six years as an undergrad. I live in German Village. I like it here, grew up here, like it here. I think of it as a big city. Having been to other big cities it feels more like that than small towns which I've also been to of course and 

Recording: (6298/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6299/ 9621) 
 And there are no computer manuals for it, so you have to figure it out totally on your own. I'm thinking I may get into that. 

Recording: (6300/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm just learning the area, but I like it so far. It seems really nice. It seems like there's a lot more to do in Columbus, obviously. 

Recording: (6301/ 9621) 
 Uh. 

Recording: (6302/ 9621) 
 Dezêmino. 

Recording: (6303/ 9621) 
 There's just too much diversity. 

Recording: (6304/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (6305/ 9621) 
 Well, I lived on 12th maybe about four or five years ago. Probably longer, but that was just for a summer thing. You know, after I saw the couches being burned, I said, shoo. No way. 

Recording: (6306/ 9621) 
 That was a lot of old thinking. 

Recording: (6307/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6308/ 9621) 
 I've seen this a thousand times now, people fighting, killing, this murdered, that murdered. It's like the same thing over and over and over. We just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it. 

Recording: (6309/ 9621) 
 39 

Recording: (6310/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6311/ 9621) 
 The first year they made it in-state only. The second class that they're going to be starting, they have some people from Michigan, I think. 

Recording: (6312/ 9621) 
 I mean he was a funny guy, he was a really nice guy, but it took him a while to catch on to things. 

Recording: (6313/ 9621) 
 I remember it being a pretty positive thing for me. I was never upset about the fact that they weren't together because they both gave me a lot of attention. I think I was maybe five or six when my mom moved into an apartment in German Village. 

Recording: (6314/ 9621) 
 Like, I don't know. It's like it's really serious and it's really not serious. Like, it's everything I guess. 

Recording: (6315/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (6316/ 9621) 
 So I think that part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends, you know, they're kind of lost. They don't know exactly what they're doing. Where like I said, I've already done all the stuff that we're doing now and know how to go about it. 

Recording: (6317/ 9621) 
 Oh, that's good. That's good. 

Recording: (6318/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (6319/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I have a brother and two sisters. 

Recording: (6320/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha 

Recording: (6321/ 9621) 
 all by yourself. 

Recording: (6322/ 9621) 
 a little bit faster. But, and then when I get out of the service, like at 22, you know, I was kind of like behind everybody, you know, as far as my age group and stuff. That didn't have to go. And so I had a lot of good times as far as that goes and, you know, cleanliness and extra godliness and all that stuff, you know, I mean, a lot of people don't, there's just a lot of lax stuff goes on today, in my opinion. 

Recording: (6323/ 9621) 
 Like, you mean sexual relationships and what? Probably the bad things about it, yeah. But just coming from my Christian beliefs and whatnot, the best thing, and I know it, even though I didn't partake in it when I was a teenager and I wasn't promiscuous at all, but I still had sex before marriage, just to be, it'd be nice if they teach you how to be confident in yourself. and I don't mean like self-esteem, but you know like we said if You know you come from a situation like that that doesn't mean you have to be like that. Do you know what I mean kind of? 

Recording: (6324/ 9621) 
 And our engineers, they're not engineers per se, but they are techies that are really into this. They enjoy their work and it's in the forefront of Ohio government. Along with the technology, there has to also be the paperwork. Now I don't realize we have a paperless environment, quote unquote. 

Recording: (6325/ 9621) 
 I was in more North Florida, Tallahassee around Tallahassee. So that's that's a little different. I mean, that's that's not That's more southern, Georgia, basically I Mean yeah, it's not so touristy and They're the thing where you couldn't have any buildings bigger than the state capital because they didn't want it to be like Orlando or Miami like Miami, especially So I was really interesting. It was a different type of town. Like not so many palm trees, more big oak trees and stuff like that. Yeah. It's real. It's more not all of us centralized downtown. It's more of us like spreading out. 

Recording: (6326/ 9621) 
 Even my mother, she said if Nixon were running today, she'd vote for him. She's that much of a conservative. Agrees with what's happened. But most people will say the same thing. There should have been another way to get him out of there. But at this point, I don't think there really was. A few months ago, yeah. 

Recording: (6327/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure, I don't know. His dad found it and told me about it because I wasn't working at the time. And we were trying to get an extra income to come in. And his dad made it actually like $25 or something. I would think he'd make more than that, because the man, every time we go over there, he's up on the computer doing something. And I'm I'm on there, you know, just, I look up baby stuff, get coupons and stuff, you know, like reading about things that happen to people, like their kid spitting up in their face or something. 

Recording: (6328/ 9621) 
 Wouldn't you like him to see that? You know, look. 

Recording: (6329/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6330/ 9621) 
 I don't know, I saw it in the paper. Some kid was suspended because he had a paper. He drew a picture of a gun and cut it out. 

Recording: (6331/ 9621) 
 it's just out of your control. And I mean, like I said, I mean, that's sort of kids for you. I mean, they just, obviously they're going to be curious about things. And the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it. But I don't know to what degree that they should go with it. 

Recording: (6332/ 9621) 
 I mean if I would have chosen to do that conflict? Oh God, my husband's a lot better at these type of questions, because he was Methodist and he chose to join Catholic when we got married. And his perception of the Methodist religion and the Catholic religion, and the more I was exposed to his, it's like, boy, these really are similar, but yours is a lot looser than mine. And, you know, it was, you know, just teaching him to be honest and open and being able to talk about sex and drugs and being there and open and keeping the lines of communication open. And then it goes back to the family being available and doing meaningful things with the children. 

Recording: (6333/ 9621) 
 It's a lot cheaper than the US because the Australian dollar is a lot weaker than the American dollar. 

Recording: (6334/ 9621) 
 You can't see it in a day. 

Recording: (6335/ 9621) 
 or anything like that. I do smack his hands. 

Recording: (6336/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6337/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6338/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but you put up with that anywhere. It's not just Ohio State. It'd be anywhere you go, you know. It's just like I said, you get, excuse me, you get assholes in. 

Recording: (6339/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (6340/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (6341/ 9621) 
 I don't know about that. He hasn't shown that period yet. I don't know if he's supposed to be showing it now or not. Because, I mean, when he goes to his Aunt Amy's, you know, bye, Mom. Look up, okay, bye. That's it. 

Recording: (6342/ 9621) 
 She's doing alright as far as I know. She's going to St. Louis University. Don't ask me why. 

Recording: (6343/ 9621) 
 But one time I read somewhere that a Mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby, and they put the little band on and they wrote female, and then they wrote her last name. She said to her husband when he came over to see her, well they've already named her, look, Femali. 

Recording: (6344/ 9621) 
 Nah. 

Recording: (6345/ 9621) 
 Well, unfortunately I don't think it's fair, but I think in the long run, it doesn't have to be a college education because most of those people probably wouldn't want a college education, but like a trade or a skill or something that'll give them a little bit of hope if they do want to choose to get a job instead of robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did, they have that choice. It's's up in their head, okay I can either go become a welder or I can have a gun I mean if they want a college education Yeah, it's it's not fair but For for you growing up and going into a lifestyle. I would prefer Having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens than somebody robbing me someday because they didn't get an education. I mean, that's a broad spectrum, and I know it's not all that cut and dried. Yeah, it would upset me, but hopefully I'd step back from it a little bit and go, well, maybe it is for the best. Yeah. 

Recording: (6346/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6347/ 9621) 
 Well, I'll take for one thing when I was overseas if we wanted to do something we'd wait till sergeant went and shed and we just put a padlock on the door so he couldn't get out. 

Recording: (6348/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (6349/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6350/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's been glamorized and they don't, they don't value human life either. I don't think because there's so much violence. You know, you can't watch TV and not seeing somebody get shot or something. And it's just like it's not really real. Because it's, you know, you turn the channel and then you see the same actor doing something else. You're like, see, it wasn't real. And I don't think they, I think, I don't know. 

Recording: (6351/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and it has the least amount of people, which is kind of neat as far as tourism. So. 

Recording: (6352/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they like they really like this town. She was from Kentucky Appalachia. 

Recording: (6353/ 9621) 
 No, I don't go to Mass every day, but I go on Sunday. 

Recording: (6354/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6355/ 9621) 
 Um, no English. 

Recording: (6356/ 9621) 
 But when you can't grow much of anything on it, it's... 

Recording: (6357/ 9621) 
 No, not really. I mean, I would have preferred it, of course. And I would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as the rest of the children did. But no, I'm very happy and content with her decision. And all of your grandchildren, have they been raised? Yeah, very much so. As a matter of fact, ironically, Julie, the Tulsa, she and her husband, both Baptist, they have both their children in a Catholic prep school. And yeah, kindergarten and preschool, and it's a, yes, it's a Catholic school environment. So it'll be interesting to see what evolves from the children's attention to the Roman Catholic side of religion as compared to the Baptists. 

Recording: (6358/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6359/ 9621) 
 Oh well. 

Recording: (6360/ 9621) 
 This is a game we play every weekend. It's an okay game. Monday night, I usually come up with something dumb that needs to occur. 

Recording: (6361/ 9621) 
 we send them in and then the kids, let's see the eighth graders take them in March and then we get the pay, the scores back in May sometime. And some of my kids, well I have a group of kids that I had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated. 

Recording: (6362/ 9621) 
 I really hate that. And like affirmative action stuff totally burns me up. The idea is wonderful, but it's just executed very poorly. I mean, I saw like during high school how easy it was for me to get into places. I mean, Citadel was begging me to come. 

Recording: (6363/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6364/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, it's huge. 

Recording: (6365/ 9621) 
 Well, when I was growing up, there wasn't that much violence. And I could go in the end, and I have done it. My name ain't on this report, so you can't do nothing about it. 

Recording: (6366/ 9621) 
 like that. 

Recording: (6367/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6368/ 9621) 
 Why would you want to leave? You said you were in third world country. Why would you want to leave the third world country? I've been, I wouldn't want to, this country has a lot of problems. It's just like, my family has a lot of problems. Why would I want to leave a family? Why would I want to leave the country? Why not work with it and correct it? Because when I run away from it, you know what I'm doing? I'm running into another chaos at the other end. Someone else coming the other direction and they haven't resolved things. And that's been happening in our society. We haven't sat down to learn and understand one another. 

Recording: (6369/ 9621) 
 Oh, that would be awesome. 

Recording: (6370/ 9621) 
 Um 

Recording: (6371/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6372/ 9621) 
 Just different stuff. It's different every day. That's why I like it. Just like with you talking to people, it's different every day. 

Recording: (6373/ 9621) 
 That's pretty extreme. 

Recording: (6374/ 9621) 
 but it fixed it. 

Recording: (6375/ 9621) 
 figures. 

Recording: (6376/ 9621) 
 It's available, it's just whether they go and put forth the efforts. 

Recording: (6377/ 9621) 
 And so, as soon as my shop found out that I could draw that, a whole $90 a month. 

Recording: (6378/ 9621) 
 Was it hard? 

Recording: (6379/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6380/ 9621) 
 I was born in New York. 

Recording: (6381/ 9621) 
 and I'm saying I could take that route, but it would cost me a lot of money that I don't have to get the legal defense. And it'd be just best for me to take the responsibility like I have. And I sold the car that I had to my sister. I'm going to pay back the apartment complex that I signed a lease for, but I'm gonna make them come after me. I already went to court once. Even with the evidence being in my favor, I mean I was only at this place three months. I didn't do any damage to it. The walls did not need painted. I wasn't there long enough to make them dirty. But their own person even went through on a first run through after I moved out. And my mother and I cleaned that thing spotless, top and bottom bathrooms, washed the floors and mopped the floors and everything. And their own person came through and said it rated the paint an A, which meant according to their system, A meant no 

Recording: (6382/ 9621) 
 Those are the formative years of a child. 

Recording: (6383/ 9621) 
 I think it has changed drastically and I think it is changing and I think it will also be changing in the future. Going all the way back, finances were not a consideration in, oh I'd say probably my first 30, maybe 40 years. There was some, there was influence, but I think the influence was not financial. It was influence from the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people and sway them with his, and I want to use the word opinion, but I know that's not right. He swayed them with a position that he had developed. Now that's not necessarily his opinion, so I'm trying to make a point there. But he would sway them based upon the influences that he had had from various people within his community, whether you're talking about a township or a county, state, whatever it may be. And yes, then slowly, then I think the finances came into play. And finances have come to a horrible, horrible situation as of today. And I'll leave out the last two years, because it's rather specific right now. But going back to two years or four years ago, finances were still a very, very heavy consideration. And not just on the national level, but I'm saying even on local levels. I know within the immediate community, there are people out there, hey, come on, we'll go to dinner, we'll go to this and we'll do this and do this, just barely, barely breaking the barrier, but not breaking the law. So yes very definitely progressively has changed. 

Recording: (6384/ 9621) 
 Right! 

Recording: (6385/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha! 

Recording: (6386/ 9621) 
 I don't think anyone really affected anyone too much as far as that goes. 

Recording: (6387/ 9621) 
 in a strange city. I know. Oh my God. 

Recording: (6388/ 9621) 
 That was so funny. 

Recording: (6389/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (6390/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, it used to be when I first started teaching, even up to sixth grade, kids were pretty respectful. 

Recording: (6391/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6392/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're okay. They're parents. They're in their 70s now. I take what I need and leave the rest because they've got their own opinions that are a lot different than mine. 

Recording: (6393/ 9621) 
 You know, they don't understand the concept, so they don't know any different of, you know, why didn't we get to stay home? They may later when they grow older, but. Yeah, but I still think, you know, they benefited a lot from it. 

Recording: (6394/ 9621) 
 I ever would have before. 

Recording: (6395/ 9621) 
 What's the point of staying married and being miserable? I think it's better to get a divorce than 

Recording: (6396/ 9621) 
 family experiences. 

Recording: (6397/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, I want to see how the season ends out. It's just a lot of the ones this season to me have just been disappointing. I mean, I think every show sort of has a peak. Some shows peak towards the end, some at the beginning and sort of level off. The Simpsons had a stretch from like their third year through like their seventh where things were just like unbelievably funny. And then they had writing changes I think and this this season it's just it's been completely outrageous storylines and like the jokes aren't as integrated into the story 

Recording: (6398/ 9621) 
 Like a girlfriend's mind. 

Recording: (6399/ 9621) 
 Well, they are now in a sense. It's easier to go somewhere else, I think, in the web. On TV, if you have four local news channels and they're all saying the same thing and emphasizing the same things, there's no choice there. If you want the news, you're going to get it one way or the other. But on the web, you can. And you know, major newspapers are all over the web. You can pick and choose and you can see different perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and I think you get a wider view. 

Recording: (6400/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6401/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6402/ 9621) 
 Years ago, there was a citizen, I don't know if you were, what your background is, whether you were here or not, but Citizen Journal was a daily paper, and it was, it was the opposite of the Dispatch. It was much more liberal. They used this, it was a morning paper, and the Dispatch was an afternoon paper, evening paper. And they shared the same facilities, the same printing presses and everything, and then Dispatch, when their lease expired, wouldn't renew their lease. 

Recording: (6403/ 9621) 
 You're right. 

Recording: (6404/ 9621) 
 Scripture and God and stuff like that. 

Recording: (6405/ 9621) 
 I'm telling you man, they wouldn't cut me slack for nothing 

Recording: (6406/ 9621) 
 Yeah. I know. Oh, it gives me goosebumps. It's such a shame. 

Recording: (6407/ 9621) 
 I don't think they should. I don't have any, you know, people are gay or, you know, that's their business. But I don't think, that's not how this world was, they wasn't put, you know, it was a man and a woman to start out with. I don't think they should encourage that. You know, maybe, that's a hard topic for me to talk about because I don't know. Because I'm sure there are gay boys that are not knowing what's going on with themselves that are in school. And I've never really understood. I never really understood if they were born like that or I just never really understood that to tell you the truth. So I wouldn't, you know, I would just, if I was a teacher I would just talk to them and you know, tell them to do whatever they feel, I mean, if they feel comfortable with being like that, that's fine. But I don't know. I don't know if I would talk about the... But maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they're like, well, what should I do? 

Recording: (6408/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6409/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6410/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6411/ 9621) 
 I like playing in that band mostly because the director is... His dad teaches trumpet here at Ohio State and he is... He likes to challenge us. And it's not so much in the summer. In the summer we end up playing marches and stuff that popular favorites 

Recording: (6412/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6413/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my one sister, my older sister, she's got one son. He's... 

Recording: (6414/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6415/ 9621) 
 No, no, I think with five of them it's just more constant. 

Recording: (6416/ 9621) 
 Uh, you know, I don't think I have, no. 

Recording: (6417/ 9621) 
 than it is 

Recording: (6418/ 9621) 
 and that the people who most face that lie are the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation. So, I mean, civil rights was an important step, but once that step was made, it was stopped. And now, I believe today, there are, I see a growing movement of people who want to, who curtail the advances that were made in the 60s. And it's not our generation who's curtailing it, it's still our parents' generation. 

Recording: (6419/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (6420/ 9621) 
 His brother and sister, they're fine. 

Recording: (6421/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (6422/ 9621) 
 Well, I think a few of them have. 

Recording: (6423/ 9621) 
 Yes, I mean, that probably, the circles I move in is what's coloring my whole view of Columbus. I mean, there's a lot, I'm sure there's a lot I don't know. 

Recording: (6424/ 9621) 
 Well the thing is in Lamaze they show you those, I'm sure you guys took those classes, they're horrible. They take 17 hours of labor, they put it into 6 minutes and you think, oh my god I'm gonna die. You know these women are like, I just want to die. You know, and you're like, why are you showing me this? 

Recording: (6425/ 9621) 
 I have no idea. I remember where I was too in the Columbine shooting because my friends and I were sitting around drinking a few beers and we're channel surfing. And we see that kid fall out of the window and we're like, oh my God, what is going on? So we just left it on. It was quite disturbing because I was recently out of high school myself and sure, there were fights and stuff, but it was always like you could avoid them or you know what I mean? 

Recording: (6426/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6427/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6428/ 9621) 
 He picks up toys, he'll vacuum, he puts dishes in the dishwasher and he can put clothes, take clothes out of the dryer and put clothes away. 

Recording: (6429/ 9621) 
 I, at one time, I kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything, but of course, that would have been, I'm 49, so I would have been probably what, about 24, so I would have about 25 years in, so I'd be getting ready to get the heck out anyway. 

Recording: (6430/ 9621) 
 Just say how you feel. 

Recording: (6431/ 9621) 
 She's real good. Yeah, yeah, everything's healthy and great. And then my daughter, I mean, I think she's just going to be a real good influence. She's a single mom. And the father is in another relationship and probably on his way to be getting married. And, you know, it doesn't look like he's going to be in the picture that much. And she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him to be too. So, could you? 

Recording: (6432/ 9621) 
 My opinion, well, my opinion changes from day to day on who's fault it is. Actually, at this point in time, I don't know who's fault it is. I think it's the fault of evolution. Well, it could have been prevented, but we didn't know it was going to happen that our society was going to change so intensely. And we kind of hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were, and they haven't. Everybody's changing, especially the younger people. And we weren't ready, and we didn't change fast enough. We didn't get ready for the change that was coming. 

Recording: (6433/ 9621) 
 I talk to all my family, my brothers and sisters every day. 

Recording: (6434/ 9621) 
 Back to bed rest, really. 

Recording: (6435/ 9621) 
 Not specifically, no. Sometimes little groups, sometimes if there's a college in a community, when I was running a school levy campaign, we would try to get them either registered and active in a campaign, but it was very difficult. Sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park active in voting. There's certain little blocks of people. And on school levies, the people who voted no, which were senior citizens, I mean, they went to the polls in droves. You didn't have to, you know, the hope there was that they wouldn't go to vote on the school levy. But actually trying to get college kids involved, I haven't really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself. It might be a little pocket of a campaign, but nothing big. 

Recording: (6436/ 9621) 
 No, no, they didn't. They didn't pay for grading or preparing your classes or researching anything. So, right, but still, even though it was a real, very much underpaid job, I liked it when I did it. I liked the introduction to the arts class because I had to develop my own curriculum for it. Right. They had a, when they told me I, they would hire me to teach this class, they gave me a book that was about this thick and it was only about painting. 

Recording: (6437/ 9621) 
 A lot of pool actually. We go to a bar called the Outer Inn because it's cheap and it's fun there. 

Recording: (6438/ 9621) 
 And as I say, we went to church fairly regularly, but to tell you the truth, I can't remember too much that I was taught then, but I was exposed to it anyway, and I'm sure that some of it rubbed off on me. 

Recording: (6439/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (6440/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6441/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6442/ 9621) 
 And they actually offered an early retirement because the funds, you may not remember, about three years ago, four years ago, the federal government was not gonna pass a budget and all this stuff, so when that doesn't happen on budget, cuts in at 75% of what the previous year budget was or something like that, which was actually more money than they were gonna give us before that. So they were either gonna lay off people or offer retirement. So I took the retirement. Because I was not happy there anyway. Then took a couple months off and did some consulting. I worked on a consulting project at Borden's for about six months. And then when that project ended, just at the same time it ended, my father-in-law was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer and he needed daily treatments here in Columbus and they were from Chillicothe. So I became his caregiver for about three months until he died. And then took a couple months off and started working part-time at the symphony. I have been since then. 

Recording: (6443/ 9621) 
 Expelling. 

Recording: (6444/ 9621) 
 Right. Yeah, we don't have a web browser version. That's what we're working on now. That's what I've been working on. 

Recording: (6445/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6446/ 9621) 
 Like the people in Japan do, they're cheaper flying in than doing it at home. Oh my gosh. 

Recording: (6447/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6448/ 9621) 
 I mean I was very good in math. Very good in math. I mean I did pretty good in all of the subjects. 

Recording: (6449/ 9621) 
 Well, I'd assume you'd be running it that whole time. 

Recording: (6450/ 9621) 
 My thing is you try to do your best on earth, do the attributes you have. Whether it's supposed to be a missionary, fine. Can you see a missionary working in the office? There's need for missionary work in the offices around us, on the campus every day. You're talking about diversity here? All you gotta do is just sit down. It's not a numbers game. It's not a numbers game at all. Just learn about one another and you're gonna find out. You know what? I think they said the colorblind society. That's what we got to do. When you're in a coma or when you're, let's say you're out, you can't see anything and you're doing surgery on you, are you going to qualify, well I want this surgeon to be this and that and that? 

Recording: (6451/ 9621) 
 So it's kind of hard, you know what I mean, to do a lot of things. 

Recording: (6452/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6453/ 9621) 
 affected me and I can't say that 

Recording: (6454/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and everybody has it, right? 

Recording: (6455/ 9621) 
 So I tighten this good. It's like it's falling. Oh, there it can go. Cool. Perfect. 

Recording: (6456/ 9621) 
 Right, but still, my oldest daughter, for a long time she was in theater, and people would say, how do you feel about that? And I said, what do you mean how I feel about that? She can always wait tables as long as she can support herself, what do I care? And then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology, and now as it turns out, she's going to, she just started back, she's the one that's having the baby though, she just started back to get certified to teach elementary school. Because we've talked so much about where would she do well? And she would just do so well. She's really good, she's such a kid herself. She's really good with kids maybe second, third grade. She's so into animals and so into science and understands different kids so that you know I think she would be fabulous there and so she's kind of decided but if that if she ends up not doing that I won't care either. 

Recording: (6457/ 9621) 
 The, yeah. 

Recording: (6458/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you may be right. Could be. Could be. 

Recording: (6459/ 9621) 
 He was having problems with his adopted mother and he was in a an all night restaurant. And he was bragging you know that he met this man and the man took him home. You know he slept at the man's place. And I was told Do you know how dangerous that you know that could have been for you. And he thought it was cool. You know. So you know just things like that. 

Recording: (6460/ 9621) 
 I think they've tried to bring the layman into more of the duties of the priest, but there's like the consecration of the bread and wine, none of that has been sanctioned. They don't perform, they are not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism, confirmation, holy, well they do holy communion, but extramunction, matrimony, none of those have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest. But I still think that it's a good, I do think the involvement of the layman is very important. But I don't have any, I mean that doesn't bother me a bit about women. 

Recording: (6461/ 9621) 
 If we ran sports, I mean the game of sports, not the administration. The administration of sports is just as unethical as the business world. It is unethical and it's one of the biggest problems we have in our society because we've emphasized sports along with a theater as being, oh, the way to go, and the poorest benchmarks you could have in terms of financial appreciation. Sure, the thing is, the market demands the dollar, that type of thing. Well, yeah, go ahead and do it. But the thing is, it gets almost to be like a lawsuit case. We are crazy, insane people. Again, it gets back to ethics. Do you think I'm worth $30 million? Let me ask you a question. Why in the hell are you coming and asking for $30 million? Don't you think you're uncouth? 

Recording: (6462/ 9621) 
 Except for last year. No, I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (6463/ 9621) 
 Yeah, actually, they just posted something on the email today. They have these old machines that used to be called 3B2s, and AT&T used to run on them. 

Recording: (6464/ 9621) 
 the one that's 18 now, I thought he was going to be left handed up until he was like four. Because his dad's left handed, my sister's left handed, I have one left handed parent. Well, all of a sudden one day he picked up a thing with the right hand and he's been with his right hand ever since. So you really can't tell. Because they're pretty much either or until they're about five. 

Recording: (6465/ 9621) 
 My mother's go in, get what you want, get the heck out. 

Recording: (6466/ 9621) 
 I do because they weren't in their children's lives enough. They weren't talking about things, being open about things, at dinner, finding out about school. You can't blame them for having a slide on the internet. Not too many parents would know that, that their kids, you know. But no, I think I put the blame on the parents. 

Recording: (6467/ 9621) 
 That's like a big thing. You know, they're saying when Northland shopping center closed down and all that. If you go up where I'm at, they got so many of them strip malls like you're talking about with stores out of them. 

Recording: (6468/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6469/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's really a tough one. Because I think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer. I don't think it's violence on TV. I don't think it's working parents. I don't know what it is. It seems to be something more pervasive than could be solved easily. I don't know, it's a tough one. I mean your daughter, his daughter is still young so you had to deal with it, but it is scary. You send your kids to school and you hear these things and it's just no matter where it is in the country or world you hear of it, you know, it really worries you. 

Recording: (6470/ 9621) 
 Freshman, sophomore year, yes. After that I quit wrestling and I just kind of found myself being myself instead of trying to be someone else. Sports is definitely part of a clique. You try to be part of the team and the team tries to do everything the same. 

Recording: (6471/ 9621) 
 Oh, the Japanese come too. 

Recording: (6472/ 9621) 
 And she goes, well, after I read the book, I asked them a lot of questions. So maybe they didn't give it to you. You know, like, we don't want to go through this again. Because she's a little older than me. I thought that was hilarious. 

Recording: (6473/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6474/ 9621) 
 I like computers. 

Recording: (6475/ 9621) 
 He was recovered. He was about 34 years old. 

Recording: (6476/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but see that was coming from his friends more than him. 

Recording: (6477/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah, it's definitely weird. 

Recording: (6478/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't do a whole lot of it, but I like to travel. 

Recording: (6479/ 9621) 
 me out. 

Recording: (6480/ 9621) 
 Yeah. The second thing would be the cultural activities that we have. Wexner Center would be one of my primary ones because there's so much going on down there, but the art museum and, oh, right, that Cultural Arts Center and Columbus Music Hall. I mean, there's just a million things. 

Recording: (6481/ 9621) 
 I don't really like it very much because it's just a big city and I don't think it's a very interesting place to me actually. It, well at least you're honest about it, you know? Is that right? Everything had grape upon. That's fantastic. And all the way backwards, okay Yeah, did it did it that doesn't try to do the tourist thing. She's always really rushed. Really? Why is that? Just because of the wall? Go visit a wall. I think I remember that when they took down the wall, the Brandenburg Gates or something like that. Okay, I remember hearing that. Say hi. 

Recording: (6482/ 9621) 
 There should have been in class. 

Recording: (6483/ 9621) 
 Just, I think it's to reflect the beliefs that we're trying to carry. Because I think if someone showed up and looking like, I mean I'm not saying that it's terrible, but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff, then somebody might not believe that they have anything credible to say. And a lot of times if you're dressed more respectfully, that to, you know, I mean, most of the people will accept you if you're dressed in a dress. Whereas, I mean, even a person in a nose ring will respect you, but then you're at a disadvantage if you don't dress in a certain way. 

Recording: (6484/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6485/ 9621) 
 But the more time I have offering, no. 

Recording: (6486/ 9621) 
 Well right now I think he knows enough. I'm just letting him be creative. He loves playing with his Legos and building things. I'm pretty, I'm like wow, I can't even build the stuff that he builds. He makes ships and cars and rockets and. 

Recording: (6487/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6488/ 9621) 
 They definitely struggle. I think to be that high up, obviously you're going to come in contact with powerful people, rich people, and things like that. But I think at least even if the Democrats do have that same thing, they seem to keep more in mind the... I don't think they represent working class, you know, guy either, but at least more so than the Republicans. So like I said, best out of a bad bunch, I'd probably... 

Recording: (6489/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6490/ 9621) 
 You should be real attentive to what's happening in his school situation his or her. 

Recording: (6491/ 9621) 
 So she's, and hopefully they'll get married soon. They've been together for over a year and a half. 

Recording: (6492/ 9621) 
 You know why? 

Recording: (6493/ 9621) 
 Oh, lots of people travel all over. Lots of people do. They do shows on Christmas if they had them, but I do 10, 12 a year. 

Recording: (6494/ 9621) 
 And neither one of these folks could answer yes or no. And they're going, just answer yes or no. That's all you, well, I think I stated my point very clearly when I was, no, the answer is yes, it was health care for live-in partners. It's a simple question, yes or no. How do you stand on this issue? And it just drives me nuts that, and I know that from want to, you don't want to shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like that. Dammit. You know, if you're running for office, you should just, just be upfront. 

Recording: (6495/ 9621) 
 I'm not saying that it's not right for some people, but you know it wasn't right for my son. 

Recording: (6496/ 9621) 
 Oh, they do? Like what? 

Recording: (6497/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (6498/ 9621) 
 Too much? 

Recording: (6499/ 9621) 
 It really is great. 

Recording: (6500/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (6501/ 9621) 
 And I looked at it and I thought, introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader than that. So I ended up coming up with a class that was, it was only nine weeks, it was only nine classes. So it was about a two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks. And I ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting mostly and visual art. And for the second three weeks we talked about music and the development of music, various aspects. And for the last three weeks we talked about theater. Actually for the two of the last three weeks we talked about theater. And for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera. So for a lot of these kids, you know, from it was an introduction to a lot of things that they might not have been exposed to. Yeah. 

Recording: (6502/ 9621) 
 Outer in is over. I don't even know like 

Recording: (6503/ 9621) 
 LSU. 

Recording: (6504/ 9621) 
 But I'm using me as an example because I've seen a lot of other people do the same thing. Don't get me wrong. 

Recording: (6505/ 9621) 
 I think that the 

Recording: (6506/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6507/ 9621) 
 It's beautiful and we like going to see the ski resorts and everything. I don't really ski. 

Recording: (6508/ 9621) 
 Catholic schools. 

Recording: (6509/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, but let's face it, people that have the real good guns are the people that shouldn't have the guns, meaning crime and whatnot. I don't have a problem with people having guns, but we don't need 60 guns per person or whatever the ratio is. It's something ungodly like that. And they keep making them. I mean, yeah, there was a time it was a part of our culture we did need to hunt to eat I have friends that bow and arrow hunt I'm not real big into hunting but at least they're they have to do something besides sit there and 

Recording: (6510/ 9621) 
 My husband lived in a town, a small town in Southern Ohio, where the dentists in town were three brothers and they were named Payne, Payne, and Payne dentists and it was spelled P-A-Y-N. There's some funny name stories out there, boy. But people just go nuts with their kids' names. I just like, would you wanna, why'd you do that to that kid? Carol Harold. 

Recording: (6511/ 9621) 
 Well, I... 

Recording: (6512/ 9621) 
 Where you're from you say? 

Recording: (6513/ 9621) 
 I said, yep. I said, you caught mommy saying a bad word and you got soap in your mouth? Yep. So I go in the bathroom. Now what I always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and I just put a little bit of soap on the end of their tongue. Well, now I've been, I've had false teeth since I was about 32. Needless to say, I had false teeth when this kid did this. She's only about five years old. Go in the bathroom. I sit down on that toilet stool and I sit there. I stick out my tongue. She takes that cake of soap, she doesn't rub my tongue, she twists it. It got on my teeth and it took me almost two weeks to get that soap taste off my teeth, no matter how I scrub. Needless to say, if I begin to get impatient after that and I'm ready to say something, I'm looking around to see if there's anything. 

Recording: (6514/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6515/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6516/ 9621) 
 Ah, okay, okay, it's part of growing up. I've been there, done that too, but still, you have to know there's respect out there to be warranted and expected and not just demand it. You have to work to show respect and then you should get respect for it. But then they saw the interaction with the elderly people, the school he went to, there's a lot of public involvement, public service required. The teachers, I often ask the teachers, I've gone to sporting events and there are teachers that are there, ticket takers, monitoring the crowd, wherever the kids, I ask them, I said, do you guys ever go home? They said, no. Oh yeah. But they're always there. They're not there just teaching a class. They're not there preparing a class. They're there after the class. They're there for the student. And they make the student feel part of the family. That is a continuation of my philosophy at home. We interact. The school is great. You have people that are on the clock, whoop, time to quit, they're gone. Those people don't know the meaning of life. They will never know the meaning of life. But if they stay around, try to extend themselves a little more with somebody that's having problems at work, and are willing to work with that person, I say willing to work, not knowing they're going to be compensated because they'll be compensated not necessarily materialistically. They'll be then when they're expected they'll be recompensated somewhere. But the thing is to lend an open hand not knowing well gee what's what's in it for me or what's in it for you is intangible. Are you willing. 

Recording: (6517/ 9621) 
 I never thought of that. 

Recording: (6518/ 9621) 
 But I think kids in high school and stuff, some of them, like my brother-in-law's gay. And when I met him, I knew he was. He was the type, some of them you can't tell. It doesn't matter what they look like. But my husband said all through growing up, he liked men. He didn't like girls. He looked at magazines, all this stuff. And I thought that's so funny, because growing up, didn't know anybody that was. But, you know, he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning. And she was from Germany, which made it a little tough because, you know, they didn't talk about those things over there at all for a long time. But then she became very open with him and everybody knew. And that was in the 80s. And, you know, if some kids know it when they're young and growing up, you know, I don't know if it's best to not say it or to, you know, be open, but if they're open to their parents about it, then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better than if they wait later on in their life, you know. But sometimes I guess they change, you know. Most of the men I knew right off the bat. It was all through their life. It wasn t as though they just said, Oh, I m going to be gay. 

Recording: (6519/ 9621) 
 really weird is where I live at I live right by right I don't even have city water and sewer I'm the only one on my side of the street 

Recording: (6520/ 9621) 
 Boy is this kindergarten teacher gonna have fun with this 

Recording: (6521/ 9621) 
 So... 

Recording: (6522/ 9621) 
 Yeah, oh gosh seems like incredible. I used to not understand what the right click on Windows was That was like when I moved in and now all of a sudden like I can't I installed my own DVD player in my computer like tore the case off and did it 

Recording: (6523/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (6524/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6525/ 9621) 
 I should have some other thing to exchange for money. I would much rather exchange ideas for money, or previously done work for money, or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money. I'm in favor of that. I come up with a good system by which to do things, I sell it to you, you go do those things, I sit around and make money off of your efforts. Yay, that. 

Recording: (6526/ 9621) 
 But as I said I went to summer school too and. 

Recording: (6527/ 9621) 
 It's alright. 

Recording: (6528/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Well, I think chiropractors would be more popular for the same type of reason. Yeah. 

Recording: (6529/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (6530/ 9621) 
 laughter 

Recording: (6531/ 9621) 
 It's good money, yeah. One idea that I just had recently is medical informaticist, which is a person who has an MD and does computers. Since those are my two main interests, I thought doing both would be really cool. 

Recording: (6532/ 9621) 
 No, no, no, it's just a small independent. 

Recording: (6533/ 9621) 
 I was trying to avoid that question. Rewind. No, but I thought, you know, just get a little insight on what's going on out there in Delaware and, you know, maybe possibly find someone to be with. 

Recording: (6534/ 9621) 
 I know there's somebody who says, well, you can even go to Vietnam now. I'm like, but why would I? It's like, yeah, you can go now to Cuba, but why would you? It's still... It's so beautiful. It's so... It's not industrialized. It's still really... It's like a pastime. It's like going back in time. It can be a bad thing conveniences, you know, like toilets and the hot water, you know, oh Really no, they don't have like your basic amenities amenities really where's it in? Are they like, aren't they like, aren't the hostels supposed to be like dormitories or you know, just you know, they just provide your basics, but they're supposed to be like at least,, you know, I mean, you get what you pay for. Okay. Okay. But it's more of the, that was more the exception than the norm. So where in Europe did you go? Where would you, well actually where would you not recommend going? Okay. 

Recording: (6535/ 9621) 
 you know, and they, some of them spoke out where they should speak out. 

Recording: (6536/ 9621) 
 Yeah, no. 

Recording: (6537/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6538/ 9621) 
 Right. Kind of the USA today syndrome. 

Recording: (6539/ 9621) 
 Like the continent. 

Recording: (6540/ 9621) 
 And as long as the wind wasn't too high, well, they could do it. I mean, they fogged it up to where you could hardly see your hand out here. 

Recording: (6541/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6542/ 9621) 
 I've lived in Columbus my entire life, 34 years, born and raised on the west side of Columbus. 

Recording: (6543/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6544/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (6545/ 9621) 
 and I think that the morals being, you know, especially at a young age, you know, abstinence is the best policy. So many people, I think they are turning to, they're not going to have anything, do anything before they're married, but in today's life, once you get into college and stuff, it's a little hard to, but I think a lot more kids are going that route, because my parents never talked to me about sex. We all learned it from our friends. My mother was very open. But I think in today's world, because really there wasn't that many diseases. I mean, you know, there was, but you just didn't hear about it. 

Recording: (6546/ 9621) 
 People are more scared of you than you are of them. 

Recording: (6547/ 9621) 
 Are they really? 

Recording: (6548/ 9621) 
 The exercise I do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so 

Recording: (6549/ 9621) 
 That's true. 

Recording: (6550/ 9621) 
 this was something that I would have done on Monday night. 

Recording: (6551/ 9621) 
 Not that valuable. But that's what they thought, though. You get it for free, and then you prove up on it, as they say. You build buildings, a house and barn, so that you can live on it. And I think, I don't know, I suppose farm a certain amount of it. I mean, put in wheat or whatever. And then after five years, you get a title to it, it's yours. So they thought, well, gee, you know, free land to a farmer. So they went out there, but Dad said in the 11 years that they were out there, they only raised three or four crops. 

Recording: (6552/ 9621) 
 Oh, did you really? 

Recording: (6553/ 9621) 
 Oh, I take the little ladies. I take the church. 

Recording: (6554/ 9621) 
 the shot. 

Recording: (6555/ 9621) 
 So how do they... 

Recording: (6556/ 9621) 
 We haven't done that much yet because his family lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

Recording: (6557/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6558/ 9621) 
 The Catholic Church is the first Christian church. And all the others are fragments. They want to be. They still tie back to it. But then it's like the commitment I was telling you. Well, I'd like to, but could you make a little extra... Give me two more minutes to make that field goal. Oh, yeah, we'll give you a little... Okay, then we'll start our own league up here. And we'll recognize all this stuff, but then we're going to to two extra minutes in our rules, okay? We'll get a league this way and so forth so we we develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish beings not to the sacrifice of what we should be doing and We're all mortal and we're all gonna be in that and I'm not saying no one makes those errors, makes errors, it's always there. The problem is to try to stay focused on that, not to jump ship. You know they say in this country, oh you don't like it, leave it. 

Recording: (6559/ 9621) 
 then have it executed as it is now. 

Recording: (6560/ 9621) 
 No more than five because there's a specific, it's called the five paragraph essay. The first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea. So I'm teaching all my kids right 

Recording: (6561/ 9621) 
 What? 

Recording: (6562/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6563/ 9621) 
 And he said that he had a health plan. And I said, what is that? And he said he had insurance, life insurance. And I go, what is that? So he goes, you know, we really need to get you over here. So that's how I went and took the test and started that way. 

Recording: (6564/ 9621) 
 I don't think they get the attention they need. 

Recording: (6565/ 9621) 
 Well, they had the GI Bill of Rights. 

Recording: (6566/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (6567/ 9621) 
 It's my baby and then, oh, you're having a baby. 

Recording: (6568/ 9621) 
 Locked in now, so, you know, I'll be 48 when I retire from here and I'll be able to go out in the workplace and feel like I've gotten good education and work skills from working here for this long. And, you know, they've definitely paid for classes for me, so I don't know what their big gripe is for education when they're striking and all this, because I've never had a problem. If you want to take a class, we get classes. We can take anything we want, so. 

Recording: (6569/ 9621) 
 Shouldn't you have a little more knowledge, a little more support around you? Educating, knowing, self-discipline? And what's really crazy is when you have multiple fathers and the children don't know the dads. 

Recording: (6570/ 9621) 
 I do all of our own taxes. I keep thinking I must be doing it wrong because it's not that hard. Everybody acts like all this is such a big deal. 

Recording: (6571/ 9621) 
 Well, when he's telling my friends that their grandparents went to hell because they're of a different religion. 

Recording: (6572/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we have talked about some things that are, you know, the Pope says this is what is and knowing full well that this is not what we think at home. Abortion and homosexuals and we're much more liberal than that. 

Recording: (6573/ 9621) 
 Which is kinda nice, I can turn the radio on. 

Recording: (6574/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. 

Recording: (6575/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (6576/ 9621) 
 before they overrun the place. 

Recording: (6577/ 9621) 
 They do, they really, okay. 

Recording: (6578/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (6579/ 9621) 
 Right, right. There I studied music and chemistry and ended up with a double major, bachelor's degree there. Not doing really the same time. 

Recording: (6580/ 9621) 
 Yeah, oh yeah. And I always use it as a decoration on the bed. But I think that that is a lot of the main problem, really. 

Recording: (6581/ 9621) 
 this will be and and the guy came back the next time and he said yeah I had a real good weekend you know it's a good idea and it's true if you show each other over and over that they're really you're really value them it just keeps coming back to you 

Recording: (6582/ 9621) 
 Now we're busy. 

Recording: (6583/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6584/ 9621) 
 Oh my gosh. 

Recording: (6585/ 9621) 
 You know, they talk about drinking from the fountain. Now they're only gargling. They're not drinking much. By the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade, they're pretty savvy these days. They're not too scared to tell you where to go and what to do. 

Recording: (6586/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's really expensive, but that's why I went there for now. I wouldn't go there. It was actually my last choice for universities, but I went there because the price. 

Recording: (6587/ 9621) 
 There are things about my dad that I wouldn't want to live with. He's great and he's wonderful to me. My dad is really wonderful to me. But things like when my mom had me, he didn't pick her up from the hospital. It's that kind of stuff that you think, what the hell were you thinking? 

Recording: (6588/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6589/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I was really glad that my son, you know, was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because, you know, the guys are real, real nice. You know, very, it's very, you know, he's always kind of been like real standoffish when it comes to 

Recording: (6590/ 9621) 
 I like that aspect. I don't pay attention to who the writers are. So maybe the writing has changed. 

Recording: (6591/ 9621) 
 Yeah, aw yeah. 

Recording: (6592/ 9621) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (6593/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so. 

Recording: (6594/ 9621) 
 You know, it's, you know. 

Recording: (6595/ 9621) 
 I was a little bit on the piss side, yeah. 

Recording: (6596/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't know, the people that I see around, you know, they're grownups. 

Recording: (6597/ 9621) 
 middle. 

Recording: (6598/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm. 

Recording: (6599/ 9621) 
 Right, which is what we look like. 

Recording: (6600/ 9621) 
 You 

Recording: (6601/ 9621) 
 Okay, good, because I don't think I'd know that one. Whatever looks pretty when it comes out. 

Recording: (6602/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6603/ 9621) 
 Hehehehe 

Recording: (6604/ 9621) 
 Yeah, which cracks me up because if you've ever looked at the parents of models, they're not necessarily all that attractive. Yeah. 

Recording: (6605/ 9621) 
 It 

Recording: (6606/ 9621) 
 I know, that's why you have to get it recorded. It would be nice to have more than one concert, but they just, they're on a shoestring, they really are. They get most of their money, I think, by, well, probably if you count in-kind contribution. Otterbein College pays for our rehearsal space, our performance space, and the salary of the conductor. So that's a huge amount of money that they put into it. And what we have to give them in return is an opportunity for people to play in an orchestra. So sometimes we have college students play in the orchestra, especially string players, because they don't have a college orchestra. But once in a while we'll get wind players play in it also. And sometimes it leads to a little bit of friction when they get to play something you wanted to play. 

Recording: (6607/ 9621) 
 No, she still lives down here. My other sister has two, niece and my nephew. 

Recording: (6608/ 9621) 
 right 

Recording: (6609/ 9621) 
 That is an embarrassment for a college this size. 

Recording: (6610/ 9621) 
 I am and they are. My wife wasn't. 

Recording: (6611/ 9621) 
 It's all up to that human being if they want to change. If they got their mindset on they don't want to be with their other sex, I don't think you can change them. That's all up to that person, I think. 

Recording: (6612/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6613/ 9621) 
 I've made them time out. Well, now for two minutes. 

Recording: (6614/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6615/ 9621) 
 I'm a mean kid. 

Recording: (6616/ 9621) 
 I don't know because I haven't kept in contact with them. I know of a couple that have. 

Recording: (6617/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6618/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6619/ 9621) 
 Not really. He's kind of between the West and the South, Southwest. 

Recording: (6620/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6621/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, ever. Authority figures at all. You know, she's really strong about that though because she doesn't look at anybody being, you know, maybe more wise or experienced in things, but you know, certainly she doesn't trust anybody. 

Recording: (6622/ 9621) 
 Yes, but you know what, his parents are going to, you know, really going to let people know that 

Recording: (6623/ 9621) 
 What are the taxes? Are they high or? 

Recording: (6624/ 9621) 
 and you said divorce is more acceptable. Divorce should never be acceptable. 

Recording: (6625/ 9621) 
 kids because they're only little ones. That's what I tell myself when I get really really frustrated. They're only little ones and they will be grown up before I know it because 

Recording: (6626/ 9621) 
 I didn't need to, so I didn't want to. 

Recording: (6627/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (6628/ 9621) 
 And I do have a brother.

 Aren't you holding it?

 and just get out there and have fun. And then we lift probably four days a week. I know I don't look like it, but I go with them and have a good time. 

Recording: (6631/ 9621) 
 Really? That's awesome. 

Recording: (6632/ 9621) 
 do it the hard way or the easy way. Well, I think everybody should have to do it the hard way. I mean, frankly, I think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it.

 He is a picky eater, which he, yeah, he doesn't like everything.

 computers that figured it out just zip zip. And then we had to locate our positions on a map. 

Recording: (6635/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (6636/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6637/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6638/ 9621) 
 um... well as far as my mom issues realm of the catholic faith and i mean she made me always go to church and things like that 

Recording: (6639/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6640/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6641/ 9621) 
 you will. 

Recording: (6642/ 9621) 
 I'd say we do at least an hour or more a day. Something like that. 

Recording: (6643/ 9621) 
 You know you have to, you know you don't have a choice, but at the same time you don't want them to suffer, but you want to keep them. It is. Whoops. Oops. I hope I didn't move. 

Recording: (6644/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6645/ 9621) 
 Or like the art shows in Worthington or the crafts or even the Irish Festival in Dublin, which can be free on certain days and things like that. The concerts on the river or on the Worthington Green, really anything like that. 

Recording: (6646/ 9621) 
 if they hold enough of my views. I'm not gonna vote for a woman just because they're a woman. And I'm not gonna vote for a Democrat just because they're a Democrat. They better have at least, and I don't need 100% agreement with my views, but I'd like to be it in the 90 to 95% range. But I don't tend to vote straight party line either. As I said, I've moderated from when I was in college to today, part of the aging process and also partly because I've noticed that to get things done, you have to have a center and it's the center that tends to rule. When I was in college, we had a bumper sticker that said America, fix it or forget it. And some of the construction people in Dayton came out with one that said, America, love it or leave it. And today I realize that both of those positions are wrong. It's America, love it and fix it. Just like with your kids, you love your kids, but you don't let them have bad manners at the table and you don't let them run around with the wrong kids and you want them to behave well. That's how I see America now. And America's become more centrist. And when it deviates from that either way, that's when people become upset. So I just think it's important. I remember when, who was the other president that I voted for that won? Carter. Black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they'd come out and hold this press conference and complain about he didn't do this for blacks and he didn't do that enough for blacks and he didn't do this and he didn't do that. And I used to say to some of my black friends, don't you see what you're doing? Don't you see the greater implications of this? Oh no, we need to have him move faster. I said, you know, that'd be great in an ideal world. This isn't an ideal world. You have to take it a step at a time whether you like it or not. I said, what you're going to do is you're going to make it look like he is so bad on all the issues, you're going to give people a reason to vote against him. Then if any big issue comes up, that's just going to be added to everything else. I said, what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he's doing a good job and that we're moving along steadily. And I don't think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means. I made that mistake when I was president of the Dayton Education Association. We were trying to get a levy passed. So we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school, all of the leaking, you know, ceilings, all of the peeling floors, all of the bad chalkboards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff. And it had the opposite effect of what we thought. People thought the schools were so bad, they said, we're not gonna support those. And they voted no. So the next time we did an opposite check, we went in and we said, 18 months later when the board put another levy on the ballot, we said, these are great schools, we have great teachers, look at this kid, he's learning to read, he's made six months improvement in three months and all that kind of, it was image, and we were saying the same thing, we wanna continue this, we wanna make even this better. We learn to say the negatives in a positive way and that's important, you know, and you need to get that, you need to appeal to the center. Americans don't like extreme liberals, they don't like extreme conservatives, you know, they want, they want peace. 

Recording: (6647/ 9621) 
 Oh gosh. 

Recording: (6648/ 9621) 
 And union's not going to do that. 

Recording: (6649/ 9621) 
 It was on national news. You see I'm not that informed on that. 

Recording: (6650/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6651/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, I want to... 

Recording: (6652/ 9621) 
 Definitely. Yeah. Like I said, I don't have parts, no different. 

Recording: (6653/ 9621) 
 I'm trying to figure out what else to tell you. I worked here at the university 24 years. 

Recording: (6654/ 9621) 
 It definitely did because I would sleep probably the eight hours right after practice until I woke up in the morning. 

Recording: (6655/ 9621) 
 And then there's Columbus. 

Recording: (6656/ 9621) 
 I've never known of him. 

Recording: (6657/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6658/ 9621) 
 Yep. Well, for so long I ate peanuts and I loved them and peanut butter. And then two years ago I started getting a reaction from it. And finally I did go to the doctor because I was so ill from it. And he said, you're allergic. Mainly it was the skins on like Spanish peanuts and things. And I never, but my body must have built up this reaction to it because I was always fine eating them. And then they really turned on me. So now I can't even eat any peanut products or the oil, because everybody's like, well, you can eat natural peanut butter. I'm like, no, it's the oil in there. They grind up the peanuts, and it's the oil. But I probably had it for a long time. And I was getting sick and thinking I had the flu or something. 

Recording: (6659/ 9621) 
 Well, I think a little bit safer idea than eliminating guns, because you know there's always going to be weapons out there. Instead of eliminating the problem, you know, more centralize it. Make it a national law that you have to be a certain age, give a certain time period for your background checks and whatever else kind of record finding they need Make sure you're you know not going to just go out and blow somebody's head off for no reason you're keeping it for you know just either security reasons hunting reasons or practice you know, but 

Recording: (6660/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay.

 Yeah.

 He had hip fusion is what it was called back then they had no artificial hips He had one leg three inches short of the other and you had no hip joint whatsoever. It was just

 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6665/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6666/ 9621) 
 Well, right now I work third shift at a menswear catalog. 

Recording: (6667/ 9621) 
 You should have all your errors corrected, even if you have to rewrite it six times. I mean, it just blows their mind when I say to them, well, the other day I wrote a letter to a senator and I had to write it six times. I wrote the letter and rewrote it until it was perfect. And every time I rewrote it, it got better. And I wrote it six times. And I'm an English teacher. 

Recording: (6668/ 9621) 
 Yeah, the other way around is probably even harder. 

Recording: (6669/ 9621) 
 I'm just saying the honors would be better just because of the smaller class size. I have like 400 in my class right now. 

Recording: (6670/ 9621) 
 No, you know I should. I really should. I do that with the dog without even realizing it, but I haven't just because I've ran for so many years. Or jogged, excuse me. I don't run. I'm too slow. Get the correct terminology there. Yeah. 

Recording: (6671/ 9621) 
 I don't think it hurt me not knowing it. 

Recording: (6672/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6673/ 9621) 
 She is four months, almost five.

 Oh, okay. 

Recording: (6675/ 9621) 
 I never heard a thing about it all the time I was in the service. 

Recording: (6676/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm.

 Well...

 You know what I mean? You can't do this, you can't do that.

 Dope. 

Recording: (6680/ 9621) 
 Beethoven, I think it was Beethoven that didn't talk until he was like seven. They thought he was retarded. But you see these people just, their brains wire differently than ours is and you just, you can't ever expect them to approach any problem like you would because they won't. It just doesn't seem logical to them. They're usually real good at puzzles. They're usually real good at, you know, things that, manipulatives, things that don't take words, things that you just have to solve by just manipulating things around, yeah. 

Recording: (6681/ 9621) 
 When I say I don't like the way it's heading, they're cramming so many houses and everything, and apartments and stuff. 

Recording: (6682/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm.

 The only time I ever did.

 and dug out the dirt under it.

 so he's not so crazy. She was doing this thing where if he did a good job on something she would give him like a fake coin and he'd put it in his bank and at the end of the week or something he could cash in and get a video or a video game or something you know that shows responsibility too. But 

Recording: (6697/ 9621) 
 and it's not fair to her or the other people. 

Recording: (6698/ 9621) 
 And then we'd know where to shift from there to another target. 

Recording: (6699/ 9621) 
 And I haven't heard the rest of the story, but what I've heard, I mean, in court, he wouldn't have a chance, a snowball's chance, if ever. 

Recording: (6700/ 9621) 
 Do they have like these big lecture halls over there too? 

Recording: (6701/ 9621) 
 And then I got here, I'm like, I don't care. 

Recording: (6702/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6703/ 9621) 
 You're gonna get a lot of dates. 

Recording: (6704/ 9621) 
 And it's just like cocaine and stuff like that. You know, your laws are different. Crack cocaine's one. The powder cocaine's another. You know, and what they're saying on that is that's a prejudice thing is what they're saying because they're saying more blacks do crack cocaine than powder cocaine because of the prison thing. I'm sure you read the paper. The way I look at it, I've had four heart attacks. Every time I have a heart attack, they swear up and down I do cocaine. 

Recording: (6705/ 9621) 
 That's why they have such sharp claws, I guess, so they can lock in. Even when those hit your head, that would hurt. Kamikaze koalas. 

Recording: (6706/ 9621) 
 Oh, they have religion. They have a religion class. They have religion every day, but some of it is just starting with prayer and Bible stories, and some of it is more the values. A lot of the teachers aren't Catholic, which I was surprised to hear that. In fact, the religion teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade, she had a religion class every day, wasn't Catholic. 

Recording: (6707/ 9621) 
 Whereas, I don't know, Lutheran is a little bit more open to

 You're intelligent.

 What do you think his reaction on life? It was just so bad that his mom couldn't take care of him and his siblings. So he was pretty much on his own, but he was taken in by a family that was members of the Mormon Church. 

Recording: (6711/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6712/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6713/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6714/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because they're more, you always hear about my black ass, my, you know what I mean, stuff like this. I could give a shit. 

Recording: (6715/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I met a lot of different people in there, a lot of interesting people. 

Recording: (6716/ 9621) 
 Um, 

Recording: (6717/ 9621) 
 They just set up on a flatbed truck on Wall Street in New York and do a concert there. 

Recording: (6718/ 9621) 
 when they drove by us. 

Recording: (6719/ 9621) 
 Compared to you, you'll have more loyalty I would think and at the same time those people won't be thinking about being hungry while they're on the line working for you. 

Recording: (6720/ 9621) 
 But you know when he first came here he said that you couldn't went here because he had too many slow white guys so 

Recording: (6721/ 9621) 
 uh... spiky skill almost five years couple months 

Recording: (6722/ 9621) 
 So she did, I don't know whether it was more than a year or not, for I think it was $40 a month. And of course that was $40 more than they had otherwise. And then I think, let's see, she went out there when Bernice was going to school, because Bernice went to, my older sister went to, I don't know, first or maybe second grade out there. So she really thought that Mom was the best teacher she ever had in grade school. But then they hired a girl to come in as a hired girl and about the second or third day she was there, she wasn't feeling very good. 

Recording: (6723/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6724/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6725/ 9621) 
 If I'd grown up with them, maybe they'd have that thing going on that my sister has, which is a bunch of shared mutual experiences. But as it stands, they're just weird. 

Recording: (6726/ 9621) 
 Yeah, make their job earlier and faster. You know, libraries like so many other places, especially universities, are facing budget problems. And subscriptions for periodicals are just outrageous.

 And the administrators for telecommunications for the state of Ohio are working with us as observers because they don't have staff.

 No, they don't actually.

 and you uh... it's just like the game battleship pretty much you know a four a two a seven and uh... well off a three dollar one i've won probably four out of five i haven't bought that many of them but in that race right there four out of five is not too bad. I got my mom one on her birthday she got $15 and the other times I get them I either win my $3 back or I won $9. Hmm 

Recording: (6731/ 9621) 
 with people who want them. 

Recording: (6732/ 9621) 
 It hasn't gone as far as loan sharking, but the thing of it is, it's fun when you win, and it's still fun when you lose. 

Recording: (6733/ 9621) 
 and just, you know, sort of doing the same old, same old every day. There was always something different. I have to be outside. And it was just a lot easier to do. 

Recording: (6734/ 9621) 
 It's more our society than the guns, I believe. It's more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself.

 Um, I, when I was growing up, I had a whole glare of cats. 

Recording: (6739/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6740/ 9621) 
 If not, you just get there. The regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff, but it's interesting because the way they advertise it, they make it sound like there's this huge place and you're going to get that no matter what and this and that. But when you actually go and look around, it kind of 

Recording: (6741/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6742/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6743/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I wouldn't do that if I had no children. 

Recording: (6744/ 9621) 
 So, you know, it's pretty busy there, but it's spread out over the 16 hours, whereas Port Columbus, sometimes you have like maybe 75, 80 airplanes in an hour's time. 

Recording: (6745/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6746/ 9621) 
 And they're like, wow, let's do this too. We can make school let out for a little bit. They might not be doing it to.

 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다. 

Recording: (6748/ 9621) 
 Boy, you know, not having kids, not being that close to it, it's hard to know. I mean, I've always thought that what their friends did and what they were exposed to at home had as much influence as anything that the school could do. But I know the school is a very powerful force in a kid's life. You know, I mean, it is a kid's life. 

Recording: (6749/ 9621) 
 Well, it's kind of hard. See, he's got two other kids. And one kid he had while we was together that he does not see at all. 

Recording: (6750/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6751/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6752/ 9621) 
 Well, how he felt and knowing that we weren't neglecting him are two different things. We've always emphasized that knowing what's right or knowing that what's just is one thing is dealing with the emotions is another one. 

Recording: (6753/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6754/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6755/ 9621) 
 No, not at all. I would have rather voted for McCain over Bush. Because Bush, he comes from a political family, which I'm not saying is wrong, because the Kennedys were a big political family. But I'm saying, like, Bush was, he just seems like he didn't really, like everything's been handed to him in life. And the issue of whether he did drugs, not that that's a big issue, but I don't like the way he addressed it. That to me, if you did drugs, okay, everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake, but the way he's handling it, saying, I'm not even going to dignify that question over and over and over. If he didn't do it, he might as well just be like, no, I didn't do it. 

Recording: (6756/ 9621) 
 No, actually I was going to get my GED after that. 

Recording: (6757/ 9621) 
 Yeah, with all the controversy about that and Polaris. I don't know. Northland is such a good location for all the people around there, and it's certainly not a neighborhood that people don't need the shopping. So I didn't see the difference of having both. I mean, there's Lazarus everywhere. There's Sears everywhere, why not have it both places? I mean I wouldn't particularly go up to Polaris if they take Northland but we're not planning on staying there anyway so I didn't yeah we'll probably move within the year.

 Which meant she'd never get the nomination because of who controls the Republican Party.

 We're still working those problems out. Yeah. 

Recording: (6761/ 9621) 
 again gets back to being in the home. Did your mother give you everything you wanted? Then she failed you, didn't she? 

Recording: (6762/ 9621) 
 And of course, I think too, as in America, the farm families, you know, they wanted, that was more labors for the vineyards, so to speak. So I think that might have influenced a lot of that. But over the years, it just made sense to me. In fact, it looks like in my family that the children are going to be mostly in twos, you know, not even going to three or four. I mean, it's not over yet, but my girls are 42 and 41, soon to be 41. So I think that their childbearing years are over. 

Recording: (6763/ 9621) 
 I know I wish I knew how to sew. I can do buttons, that's about it.

 No.

 Right, right. He would go for weeks. He would get mad at me and not speak to me when I was growing up for a week or two at a time. My mother would say, please, Nancy. I changed my name when I went to college. I just decided I'm out of here. Everything's gone. And so she would say, Nancy, please just talk to your father. Just for my sake, please talk. And I would think, I'm the child here. I shouldn't have to be the one to make peace in this family if he doesn't want to talk to me. I don't need him. I don't have to talk to him.

 Attention deficit hyperactive disorder. 

Recording: (6767/ 9621) 
 Now there's a lot of people good at church that aren't worth anything too, you know, so I don't really believe that going to church, you know, makes you a better human being than another human being. I believe that most people's basic structure in life, if it's based similar to the Bible, or you could say Buddhism or whatever, you know, that you'll tend to have a better life than you will if you practice non-quote-unquote religious ways. But I don't believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person, because there's a lot of hypocrites that go to church. These kids, I think more, just more than anything else, I mean, one thing I remember hearing a lot about too was what they were picked on. 

Recording: (6768/ 9621) 
 and subsequently lost my job after that and things got difficult, more and more difficult. I was unable to work full time. I'm doing some part time work right now, working with people with mental illness. But it's, you know, the thing I'm running into out there is that nobody wants to pay you to do anything. I don't understand that. And then when they do want you to do something, they abuse the hell out of you. You know, they give you a pager, a cell phone, and they want to know where you are morning, noon, and night, seven days a week, and it's none of their business. So the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and how I operate and will give me freedom to do what I can do. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Communications but it's been more of a problem than it's been an asset. Interviewing for jobs, people that were doing the interviewing had just a high school education. And they're not gonna hire me when after a year I'd be their boss. So a lot of that is out there regardless of what people say. I'm not trying to be pessimistic or negative. It's just been my experience. Unfortunately, I hope it gets better. But like I said, I haven't been ever told that my degree matters by any employer. Contrary to what the news tells you and what people will tell you, oh, go get that college degree. People told me as soon as I got out of college that I needed a master's. And then they said, and after you get your master's, you'll definitely need your doctorate. Well, you know, the people saying this are college people. College is a business. And it takes a while to realize that. If you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships, that's good. But then even now, being a person with a semi-disability from a brain injury, I mean, I don't even like to call it a disability. I have different abilities now, same abilities I used to do, but I have to do them a different way. Just because my brain functions on a different level and I can't explain that to anybody and I shouldn't have to, but I'm always forced to. But trying to find a job, you know, resulting from this has been difficult. And I'm not giving up hope or nothing like that. I'm just trying to cut through and see what I can do. And there's just, it's very limited out there you know and your education is an asset but like I said even as a person now going through BVR I'm discriminated against in my opinion because I have a bachelor's. In other words, Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation which is a government funded organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work. And because I already have a bachelor's, they won't pay for school. Now if I were stupid, you know, if I just had a basic, just got out of grade school and didn't even have my GED, boy, they'd pay for my high school, my college and everything. You know, even living expenses, you know, but because I have a bachelor's, nothing, you know.

 I liked it. There's an episode, I think it was in the third season, where they were stuck on an island. 

Recording: (6770/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6771/ 9621) 
 போ அருண் 

Recording: (6772/ 9621) 
 so that he got down in an area under that concrete floor. The concrete was about so deep, which 

Recording: (6773/ 9621) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (6774/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6775/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6776/ 9621) 
 Whatever you need. 

Recording: (6777/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6778/ 9621) 
 I'm a professor, I'm doing studies here. 

Recording: (6779/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (6780/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6781/ 9621) 
 Playing around with my Linux, you know? 

Recording: (6782/ 9621) 
 for the concert on the river. We don't tend to take her to things like the art festival or it's just too crowded. 

Recording: (6783/ 9621) 
 And what we'd do sometimes when we'd get into an area and we'd know that we'd had a field out here we'd be shooting to, we would adjust on a target out there. 

Recording: (6784/ 9621) 
 No, I don't think they did. 

Recording: (6785/ 9621) 
 They get better and better and better. 

Recording: (6786/ 9621) 
 it kind of yeah well I've seen worse so um so and they're doing this I think it's called sit and reach where he's got to sit on the floor and he's got to raise his feet up just so and and he's got to take his hands and reach towards his toes and they do that for you know like five minutes first time and they increase it and he really hates it 

Recording: (6787/ 9621) 
 And he paid for it when he got to college. It was rough for him to start out because he was behind then. 

Recording: (6788/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think every college does. 

Recording: (6789/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6790/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6791/ 9621) 
 I've seen more people violent on liquor. Like I said, I worked in bars. 

Recording: (6792/ 9621) 
 you know, you left that part out. 

Recording: (6793/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (6794/ 9621) 
 I went to Brookhaven, which is up on Carl Road near North Le Mans. 

Recording: (6795/ 9621) 
 But that's a sign that not only are we doing the dumbing down of jobs, 

Recording: (6796/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah He loved to hate him or love him one day I think he's a great coach I think he does some stupid things, but we're all do you know 

Recording: (6797/ 9621) 
 We couldn't have class and in addition they were like trying to tip over buses and throwing stones at them. 

Recording: (6798/ 9621) 
 And that split second I was like, okay, he's gonna do this to me, he's gonna do this to my kids. 

Recording: (6799/ 9621) 
 Well, I work with around mostly black people and it's a weird situation. I heard more prejudiced than I've noticed now than when I only worked around a couple of them. 

Recording: (6800/ 9621) 
 I just, I can't believe there's that many people that need the service all the time. 

Recording: (6801/ 9621) 
 There are some foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding classes. 

Recording: (6802/ 9621) 
 Well, my oldest one is really odd because the school she goes to it's sort of like thrift store chic and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and I told I said, you know, we are not in the poorhouse. You're not buying clothes at the thrift store. So she basically went through my closet and took everything that was old of mine and wore it. And I thought, oh my gosh, you know, because she just looks like a bum, I think. And you know, when it was time for like a dance or something, she would go out and buy a dress, you know, at Penny's or someplace at the mall, you know, and maybe spend like $80 for a dress. And the same thing would happen every time she would go and come home. I'd go, what did they say, you know, about your dress? And she goes, Jelena, is that you? And I go, see, you clean up really nice. I said, you know, you have the best shape you're ever going to have in your life. And what do you do? You wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants. I said, you know, when you get in your 50s and you've got a gut and a big ass, you know, you could do that. 

Recording: (6803/ 9621) 
 And so. 

Recording: (6804/ 9621) 
 And then, like people who work go back until like, you know, maybe two to six. The kids are done with school for the day at like 12 or one. 

Recording: (6805/ 9621) 
 in the elementary school library. We focus on sex so much in our society, I think. And part of family life, so sex is such a small part of family life. You know, I mean, especially with the elementary school kids. I mean, it's just, is there milk and cookies after school? 

Recording: (6806/ 9621) 
 But we go out and look at we do it differently in sports, but we do this differently in the secular world. 

Recording: (6807/ 9621) 
 Some of those triple every year. 

Recording: (6808/ 9621) 
 That's where my father's from. 

Recording: (6809/ 9621) 
 um... at the same time to at the same time uh... that my mother my dad split up i was just about to start my second year at worthington high school so i'm about to start my sophomore year and for the first time in something like three years i'm at the school for two years in a row and so i was like i just finally made. There's no way in hell I'm leaving the friends I just finally succeeded in making. My father and I always understood each other. Noise! Stop whining. So my father and I, I'm going to start getting phone calls here in a little bit. I'll just postpone. So my father and I always, for the third time, understood each other much better than my mother and I did. We were able to communicate in very similar fashions. We didn't always agree, and in fact I'm probably more diametrically opposed to him than anybody else I ever got to play with, but at least he understood what was going on from one moment to the next. And so it was kind of a no-brainer. I was like, all my friends and somebody who understands 

Recording: (6810/ 9621) 
 I'm working here, but work-studying. 

Recording: (6811/ 9621) 
 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 

Recording: (6812/ 9621) 
 The only people out there other than homesteaders were seaporters. 

Recording: (6813/ 9621) 
 Packing, just working to mend the warehouse, packing stuff, and then the BVA, just kind of do what needs to be done, you know, to help people out. So you were in the military at the time that you said you were in there, especially you were in Vietnam, right? No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but I was in during that time. 

Recording: (6814/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I do. Because some boys might not wear them because they don't know how to put them on. I don't know. I'm not sure because I'm not a boy. Maybe some boys would experience with it before they originally use it. But I don't think it's encouraging them at all. At the same time, they should be telling them they shouldn't have sex till they're married. 

Recording: (6815/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (6816/ 9621) 
 No, no, I'm, whoa. Too many wires here, got it. No, it's basically 8-5, you know, Monday through Friday. I traveled some, and so I had to travel on a weekend, so I got, you know, comp time. 

Recording: (6817/ 9621) 
 Well, in law enforcement, you'd start out and you'd do exercises for like two hours. 

Recording: (6818/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6819/ 9621) 
 We were just talking about that last night, my wife and I, and thinking another five years we might want to get out of here. 

Recording: (6820/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6821/ 9621) 
 little different. 

Recording: (6822/ 9621) 
 as youth. 

Recording: (6823/ 9621) 
 I mean nothing's happened to him and I mean like I said the getting high part of it isn't so much of the problem it's just what goes into it. 

Recording: (6824/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6825/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6826/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (6827/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6828/ 9621) 
 well, like a million miles down to the South End or something like that. But you just punch in your numbers always. You just talk with numbers. 

Recording: (6829/ 9621) 
 But if you get to the point where there isn't, then you just have to, I don't know, I think you have to be in the situation. In my situation, I think for my parents, it's better that they split up because they're both very happy now. 

Recording: (6830/ 9621) 
 cause any harm but 

Recording: (6831/ 9621) 
 here. 

Recording: (6832/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6833/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my husband was one of those. 

Recording: (6834/ 9621) 
 Northland Mall. 

Recording: (6835/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6836/ 9621) 
 You would think, but I don't know. There has to be something. The first state that does it. I mean, after one, I'm sure others would follow suit after they see the benefits of it. But that first one, I don't know. 

Recording: (6837/ 9621) 
 I paint Sesame Street or something. I don't paint Sesame Street. There's something from childhood that I paint, and now it's somewhat mainstream, so it sounds a little funny. I've painted a couple of portraits I'm pretty happy with of some friends. I've done a self-portrait, that kind of thing. 

Recording: (6838/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6839/ 9621) 
 grounding it there so they can go forward. 

Recording: (6840/ 9621) 
 You learn a heck of a lot from that aging person. A heck of a lot more than you would through interviewing me, really. 

Recording: (6841/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6842/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (6843/ 9621) 
 Yeah. So. 

Recording: (6844/ 9621) 
 they can 

Recording: (6845/ 9621) 
 Wittenberg. 

Recording: (6846/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but, you know. 

Recording: (6847/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I was. And because I was working at a recruiting firm, and we had a lot of business before. And I was pretty sick during the morning and afternoon part. And basically, we talked about it, and I just decided to go ahead and just take some time off. And I don't know. I also went back to school then, too. So I figured I'd take that time off, and I'm going to Otterbein to get my master's in education. 

Recording: (6848/ 9621) 
 I'm 52. 

Recording: (6849/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, it's fun. 

Recording: (6850/ 9621) 
 By the way. 

Recording: (6851/ 9621) 
 So I mean, he was just one of those people, I guess. I mean, there was really no hope for. 

Recording: (6852/ 9621) 
 To me if you're going to enforce the gun laws and make them stricter what you ought to do is put a limit on the barrel length and stuff on guns. If you get caught with a gun with a barrel smaller than eight inches you go to jail. 

Recording: (6853/ 9621) 
 that kind of stuff. So it was mostly like what we would do is we would talk about, we'd talk about like medication, like as far as why you're in labor. 

Recording: (6854/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6855/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (6856/ 9621) 
 You're right. I never went back home. 

Recording: (6857/ 9621) 
 Think it gave her the I was saying they were getting mad I've gotten mad at Devin quite a few times, you know, because I didn't like to some of the things that she would either say or or that she would do or But you know, I try to let her live her life, you know, I think there's a Nobody can teach you anything unless you learn it 

Recording: (6858/ 9621) 
 No, not as we was driving. I told him I need this money for this thing and you know, it's pretty much payday. I want to go out, get some food, go out and have a drink and you know, just save up some of my money so I can get a car. Didn't seem that way to him. He, you know, F you and all this stuff. He flapped off at the gums a lot and I didn't like that, so I went up there to the pay phone. I called two places. I called my mom first. And I told her I'm on my way up. And then called the IRS in Cincinnati and told them that he owns a business, he's got this and this and this. And he paid me and this other guy under the table this much. and you're technically only allowed to have so many hours a day to be doing free jobs or tax-free jobs and I was agreeing with it until he got on my bad side. 

Recording: (6859/ 9621) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (6860/ 9621) 
 While they were here, there were many people that were bad eggs, man. 

Recording: (6861/ 9621) 
 Yeah, plus a lot of work stress that she's had and stuff. 

Recording: (6862/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his own understanding of phonics. And yeah, I've been pretty impressed. I'm like, wow, you got that really, really close to being the right spelling. 

Recording: (6863/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6864/ 9621) 
 I have. 

Recording: (6865/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6866/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6867/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (6868/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well she stayed with us for the first week and then she was done. She was like ready to go. So, and that was okay. But her apartment lease was up the week that she was in the hospital having the baby. So I had to move her. And my husband's family was visiting at the time. And so his mom stayed, she lives in Florida, and she stayed with me and helped me pack her whole apartment and get her into her new apartment and that was just you know. 

Recording: (6869/ 9621) 
 minimum hundred days. 

Recording: (6870/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6871/ 9621) 
 We were talking to her almost daily on the phone, in her office. And the last week, she said, there's only one week of school left. She said, well, I better do my work. And he sat down and did it. 

Recording: (6872/ 9621) 
 No, unfortunately not. 

Recording: (6873/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6874/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6875/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6876/ 9621) 
 So we'd be like a waitress or clerical. 

Recording: (6877/ 9621) 
 dehydration. 

Recording: (6878/ 9621) 
 I know that they changed it. I know that it used to just be one day, I guess, because of the health care, something like that. I feel like a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me. I mean, unless there's some type of complications, I would be perfectly ready to go home, you know, unless there's something extra that they could do for me there. 

Recording: (6879/ 9621) 
 I used to fish and stuff like that, but I've had skin cancer, I've had poor heart attacks, and if you look at my skin now, you see all the blisters and stuff on it. 

Recording: (6880/ 9621) 
 you're in there flying and you're turning and you're putting your flaps down and I go, 698 Juliet, say your altitude and you're like, did they call me? Because you have a lot of things going on. And I'm Mr. Laid Back in that area. A lot of people go, I don't see how you can be so calm. But I always look at it, though, as I can scare you to death and you'll never come back to Columbus or any airport that has a tower. Or I can be nice to you and you can go out and spread the word that there are some people there that are pretty 

Recording: (6881/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. You know, even within marriage, it's just like... Taboo, yeah. 

Recording: (6882/ 9621) 
 I don't really care. Why should I? Yeah, but you still just think, well, because I'm thinking too. So what happens when they die? Am I going to be feeling bad that this, and I, but I can't, my sister said, look, you know, you're not going to change. And I'm not. The reason he won't come to my house is because when he goes to their house, everything changes. They have to have dinner at 10 o'clock in the morning. We're not doing that. We're going to compromise and we'll do it at one o'clock. We'll do it at noon. We have dinner at 7 o'clock at night, right? We'll do it at noon. I'm not doing it at 10 o'clock in the morning. I don't care. And there's no compromise with him. You have to compromise. 

Recording: (6883/ 9621) 
 Really? Okay. I didn't know there was like a ripple effect for a stir. I thought, you know, being so remote, you know. 

Recording: (6884/ 9621) 
 But I'm mainly an artist. I work in pen and ink and colored pencil and do mainly humorous sort of things, cartoony things. 

Recording: (6885/ 9621) 
 It does. 

Recording: (6886/ 9621) 
 A lot of my kids do much better with writing on the computer because they know that they can go back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they can even get grammar help or they can maybe even get syntax help if it says this is awkward or something, turn the sentence around. So my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the computer than if they are asked to do it pencil and paper. So that's what I make them do. They're webbing. You know what a webbing is, don't you? Where you web out an idea, 

Recording: (6887/ 9621) 
 Historically, you know, my dad's people were Democrats, but then they turned Republican because they thought they were supposed to turn Republican, I guess. But, you know, there's some of the conservative values that are very important to me, you know, but then there's some social things that are real important, too. 

Recording: (6888/ 9621) 
 You can go anywhere, get something to drink. 

Recording: (6889/ 9621) 
 ground up bone. So my mom was working and it's going to sound sickening. I was 12 years old. I'd even have to come home from school and stick suppositories up on 

Recording: (6890/ 9621) 
 You just get sent wherever. 

Recording: (6891/ 9621) 
 She was, Mary's mother was a kind of a free-thinking, not a liberal, but, well, she went out when she was in her early 20s, went out to north or south Dakota, one or the other, in Homestead. 

Recording: (6892/ 9621) 
 You're here for a reason. And you're here in the United States for a reason. Of all the beatitudes you have here. Don't you think it's time to share some of those things? The talent? And to not necessarily be recognized for those things, but some personalities require personalities, it's the way it is, but to do things without expecting something in return. That would be so nice to see that written on magazine fronts. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, what's good in life, you know? If we can teach people to think the way you're trying to tell me, well, businesses tell us we should do it, then why doesn't business take a more social correctiveness, not political correctness Yeah, they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the deduction allowances because even when we reduced deductions it went down too. Yeah. 

Recording: (6893/ 9621) 
 I moved to Louisville, Kentucky. 

Recording: (6894/ 9621) 
 I was marathon training and I only got up to about 9 miles and I have unfortunately about 50 pounds of extra weight on me but even like I said when I was skinnier. I have like a bum knee on distance. I'm okay to run the lower but 

Recording: (6895/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they do. Let's see. You have to complete either a thesis or a contract, which consists of taking lots of honors classes. 

Recording: (6896/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6897/ 9621) 
 I'd like to move to Mount Sterling or something like that. 

Recording: (6898/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't think that though. You know, women need to work and most families do need two incomes. And plus, when kids go into high school, you know, you have to worry about them, but you know, you have to let them experience some of life on their own. 

Recording: (6899/ 9621) 
 I got one sister. 

Recording: (6900/ 9621) 
 Well, that basically is there, you know, as your influx of people move out of city limits and everything, you know, then, you know, you've got to have places for them to shop and everything. And basically, the Northland Mall's been there forever. Jacob, who owned Indians, owned it. He never did anything to it, you know, so. You got your Lazarus, your Penny's, and Mainstay places that generally moved there because of the years ago because it was Something well, it was right there with a lot of people population and everything and then like I say if you're gonna be good basically the people moving out to get away from the Traffic and all that stuff, you know, not that they're moving away from it. They're still getting into it, but Just your perspective on Then you have to if you build it they will come they say, you know, and I guess he's still gonna build it so 

Recording: (6901/ 9621) 
 Some of them are pretty good at that. Some of them aren't too. Some of them, like when you have them copy, like from this box down to this box, these little shapes in a certain amount of time. If their visual perception is messed up, they screw that all up. They, you know, the form goes this way, they draw it this way. Their brain flips it around on them. That's why they have trouble with N's and U's and B's and D's. And they're reversing, you know. Normal kids that goes away about age eight. My kids, they're still doing it. You know, they're still, or they might make an eight from the bottom up instead of from the top down or a six from the bottom up. I even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up. You could tell by watching them write that their brain didn't work like yours did. 

Recording: (6902/ 9621) 
 I just like it because it's smaller. 

Recording: (6903/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6904/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. People say things like, oh, I wish I had a job where I got three months off every summer. And I'm just, I hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store, and I just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say, yeah, and yesterday while you were watching the football game, I was grading papers at the kitchen table, you know. And if I go out of town on the weekend, I have to take my school bag and all my work with me. It never ends. You know, I put in about 70 hours a week during the time of the year when I do teach, and by the way, it's not three months anymore. You work for a week after the kids get out of school in June, which usually puts you at about the 12th to the 15th of June. School starts back the 23rd of August, at least in Worthington it did, and you have to be back a week before that, so they've shaved both ends of that off until it's like 10 days in June and maybe 15 days in August and all of July. So, and then you spend some of that time going to seminars and upgrading your certificate

 I mean, in some ways I think competition is a bad thing because in our society it's usually not fair. Someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further. But I mean, I like the fact that we've got this super high tech tape recorder, not a big reel to reel thing. I like the fact that I could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a computer internet rather than going to the card catalog, finding out that there are books that are not in our library, and then where do I go from there? I like being able to look, oh, Library of Congress has it. I'll just drive out to Washington or have them send it here. That, I think, is a major contribution of the past generation. 

Recording: (6906/ 9621) 
 which is nice. We've got a lot of support from everybody. It gets good. Kind of confusing on holidays. 

Recording: (6907/ 9621) 
 Isn't it unbelievable? 

Recording: (6908/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, Archie Bunker meets Fred Flintstone. There you go. I can't really put him in the category of Forrest Gump because Forrest Gump was a great guy. 

Recording: (6909/ 9621) 
 Yep, I graduated from Brookhaven. 

Recording: (6910/ 9621) 
 The only thing you can do is beat my rear end, you know. 

Recording: (6911/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6912/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly! 

Recording: (6913/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6914/ 9621) 
 Really classy. 

Recording: (6915/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I've lived with my mom since then. 

Recording: (6916/ 9621) 
 I was. 

Recording: (6917/ 9621) 
 yeah i could be in the something really like multimedia like that it's like uh... how they designed it 

Recording: (6918/ 9621) 
 Makes it difficult. It's an adjustment. 

Recording: (6919/ 9621) 
 Yeah, most of them do. And then pretty much the rest of them just hang out, go to school. 

Recording: (6920/ 9621) 
 See, that's how my husband was. He didn't have a pet growing up. 

Recording: (6921/ 9621) 
 Well, I know with myself when we had Pete always says that if it wasn't for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is really involved. He likes what he's doing. He has tremendous responsibility and but he loves it. But the thing is when the kids were little too, you know, I was always having to pull him back and say don't forget, you know, they're going to grow up fast if you if you don't spend this time and now I mean, like I said, the youngest is 13, and so he's been at this for all these years, and I don't have to do that anymore. I mean, someplace along the way about 10 years ago, he got so involved in their lives. But when they're little, 

Recording: (6922/ 9621) 
 Let's see. You usually go out to lunch at some fast food place, and then we get together and cook dinner. 

Recording: (6923/ 9621) 
 So we lower the standards to meet that. 

Recording: (6924/ 9621) 
 the sheepherders, and they were not very desirable specimens other than for herding sheep. And we'd come in dirty as an old sheepherder. 

Recording: (6925/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6926/ 9621) 
 So... 

Recording: (6927/ 9621) 
 You know, do I feel safe? Is this a place I can go? Is there somebody who always takes care of me? And I think left to their own devices. 

Recording: (6928/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6929/ 9621) 
 Mm hmm. Yeah, because they think they're grown. They think they're grown and they're like 12 and 13 and they've been having sex since they were 10. And it's just like, and yeah, and they're having babies earlier and earlier. And it's just really scary. 

Recording: (6930/ 9621) 
 Right. I have a neighbor that's that way. 

Recording: (6931/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (6932/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (6933/ 9621) 
 Right. Well, not just one. My older brother would have been two and a half or three. 

Recording: (6934/ 9621) 
 No, I just think that typically you see a lot of places that are under construction, not very many people working there. 

Recording: (6935/ 9621) 
 Coastside is going to be opening up on the 6th. Looking forward to doing that. We had a season's pass to Wyandotte Lake. Spent a lot of time at the pools. Different swim centers, Hunter, different rec centers. The Y programs are excellent. Even here at Ohio State, they've got the recreational sports on Sunday afternoons where they can go. We go to the zoo a lot. Libraries have story times, reading hours, those type of things. Just all kinds of community things. Easter egg hunts at the rec centers. 

Recording: (6936/ 9621) 
 Uh... 

Recording: (6937/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (6938/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (6939/ 9621) 
 I think so. 

Recording: (6940/ 9621) 
 disciplined, I would be screamed at, may get jumped on the floor to do push-ups. I mean, it was it was just 

Recording: (6941/ 9621) 
 do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it's like six and seven hours a day at the computer and I just don't want to do it. 

Recording: (6942/ 9621) 
 retire him. 

Recording: (6943/ 9621) 
 That was all on air. 

Recording: (6944/ 9621) 
 That's exactly how I am. When you said, what would I do? I might do a house. I might go to school some. I used to own a gallery. I might do something like that again. There's just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen. 

Recording: (6945/ 9621) 
 It's just the spiritual aspect, there is a realm, even Einstein, the most brilliant man, supposedly mathematically of our time, even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has. Yeah, but nobody has taken the time or made the time to challenge his theory. 

Recording: (6946/ 9621) 
 That would probably affect my decision a little bit. 

Recording: (6947/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's spring break. A couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids. 

Recording: (6948/ 9621) 
 What goes on nationally, especially interested in this presidential election. 

Recording: (6949/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6950/ 9621) 
 Don't you think? 

Recording: (6951/ 9621) 
 but then they have one injury and then what are they going to do? And they got to think of that. They have a free education and they just don't think of it that way. You know, they think they can make enough money but, you know, 

Recording: (6952/ 9621) 
 and also at the Show of Hands galleries. 

Recording: (6953/ 9621) 
 Dude. 

Recording: (6954/ 9621) 
 You don't think it's growing too fast? They should try to bring people back into the city more. Right. I would say lack of notice in any other city in the United States. Why in the world do they have to work on all the roads all at the same time? I don't understand. They have to, they're working on 315, 270, 70, 71, 670 all at the same time. Why? Why? I don't planning going on there. Apparently not. Anyway, okay, our time is about up, unless you have anything burning to say. Not really. I think we covered most of the topics I usually cover, and some that I only occasionally cover. 

Recording: (6955/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. I was stationed, permanent duty station was in North Carolina. 

Recording: (6956/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they could afford to go there, so they did. 

Recording: (6957/ 9621) 
 And there you go. 

Recording: (6958/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6959/ 9621) 
 OK. Yeah, sure. No, it's OK. 

Recording: (6960/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (6961/ 9621) 
 I could fire them because they're gay. I could care less. 

Recording: (6962/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (6963/ 9621) 
 So however this works out, you know, I don't know. I'm just like, okay. She just says, I just want to get it over with. And see, now she, you know. 

Recording: (6964/ 9621) 
 Well, her major is communications. It didn't start out that, but my daughter wants to write books. OK? Well. 

Recording: (6965/ 9621) 
 No, I'm living, yeah, that's my bro call. 

Recording: (6966/ 9621) 
 haha 

Recording: (6967/ 9621) 
 Her and her mother went and seen it and everything. We were divorced at the time. Then I went and bought the movie. 

Recording: (6968/ 9621) 
 And then how satisfying is that to them? When you have a chance to talk to them? That's where we need to learn more from, interview, have more meaningful interviews with these people so that we can learn from them. I put them on spotlight, but we somehow, we just don't wanna, I guess, flood them with the, we don't wanna get the negative answer because, oh, it might hurt the image of the university. Oh, gee, no. Who is it? Katzenmoyer or something? Well, hey, we realize that the university only wants players who are to draw gate money. That's all they want to do. They're not here for academics. They don't talk about academics when they're coming to Ohio State. 

Recording: (6969/ 9621) 
 The teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital. Those things happen. 

Recording: (6970/ 9621) 
 It was. 

Recording: (6971/ 9621) 
 Stay off. 

Recording: (6972/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6973/ 9621) 
 A lot of people have switched from being like the really quiet, more reserved people to the party animal. 

Recording: (6974/ 9621) 
 I would tend to say most people I know are at least fairly ethical. I mean, there's no more sinister group than the other that I know. 

Recording: (6975/ 9621) 
 Eventually. 

Recording: (6976/ 9621) 
 He works. 

Recording: (6977/ 9621) 
 I think so. I think partial birth isn't such a big issue because I mean it hardly ever comes up. But I, with so many things, it's like a, it's a foot in the door. If we can do that, then we can say, well, you know, maybe not in the third trimester. And then we can say, well, not in the second trimester. 

Recording: (6978/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (6979/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6980/ 9621) 
 I've almost been hit, I don't know how many times, people talking on telephones. I see people turning with no turn signals. 

Recording: (6981/ 9621) 
 There is a web access to some of our systems, but not all of them. We're putting more uniform on it for everything. And I don't, it may be, OSU has its own system, but they can also connect to our system for things they don't have in their system. And it's, so I'm not sure what system you're talking about. 

Recording: (6982/ 9621) 
 I'm gonna cry. 

Recording: (6983/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (6984/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (6985/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (6986/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you can't ignore it. Because, you know, because that's something else. When I was in high school, I don't think I knew the word. But now everybody knows. Anybody who's a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot. And so it's better if you can diffuse that. But I, boy, I wouldn't know how to approach it. I mean, I think it should be approached, but, ooh, I wouldn't have a clue. 

Recording: (6987/ 9621) 
 Like, yeah, like 500 people in a lecture hall, yeah. 

Recording: (6988/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm 235. 

Recording: (6989/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (6990/ 9621) 
 The United States knows about it. They can sit there and they'll pay the welfare. They won't do nothing to him. 

Recording: (6991/ 9621) 
 Real war. 

Recording: (6992/ 9621) 
 Right. And it's all the bucks. Because people I work with, you know, there are some people I work with that have house payments. One guy, he has the biggest, $2,200 a month. And a lot of them have like $1,500 and up. And you know, I bought my house years and years ago, and it's like $485. And I wouldn't dare tell him that, but it's like, you know, because they're always, you know, there are people there that make a lot more money than I do and they're always like broke. But yet, you know, like when they go do something, they've got to have the best of everything, the best of, it's like, you know, you know, to me, you just have to kind of think about things a little bit. And it's like, you know, do I, do I really need to go to, what would I say, TGI Fridays for lunch and spend $12 or can I go to Taco Bell and spend like three and use the other part for maybe like a book for my kid or you know they have like my daughters in swimming I need the money for a swimsuit well why don't I use it for that you know so it's 

Recording: (6993/ 9621) 
 because it's more open and you couch it in terms of civil rights. My boyfriend thinks it's wrong morally but doesn't think we ought to be discriminating against. He thinks it's a sin, therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through talking to them religion-wise. I don't think it's a sin. I think that your sexuality is genetic-based and that you can no more change your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair. You may put a dye on it or you may put a different whatever those eye pieces are, contacts. I don't wear glasses so I can never remember those terms. But that's just cosmetic and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation, that's cosmetic too. And again, my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business, not mine. So I don't know that anyone could change it. What was your question again? 

Recording: (6994/ 9621) 
 wander around, look at things. 

Recording: (6995/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6996/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (6997/ 9621) 
 Well, it's gotta come from the top. I just found there was just a total lack of interest in the student from every direction. So I would say, you know, it's an organizational problem and no, you know, no motivation, you know, to do their job, you know, properly. Now, I live down the street from what they call Cause. It's Columbus Alternative High School. And you get there through a lottery system, and they have the best reputation of all the Columbus schools. And those kids leave there getting full scholarships. My son went there one year. It was a disaster for him. 

Recording: (6998/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're pro-strike. We're getting money on Buck IDs, but, you know. 

Recording: (6999/ 9621) 
 a bad one or a good one. 

Recording: (7000/ 9621) 
 So there's been a lot of pressure there. 

Recording: (7001/ 9621) 
 and a disease that affected her mind. And of course, you know, back then I didn't really know that, but there was a lot of conflict. 

Recording: (7002/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was interesting. 

Recording: (7003/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7004/ 9621) 
 That flipped me out. 

Recording: (7005/ 9621) 
 How can you do that? 

Recording: (7006/ 9621) 
 I mean, I didn't have the greatest childhood. I don't think any of us ever really had the best, you know, but But I wouldn't talk to my kid the way some of these people talk to them But one today, you know, she got on the bus and a little girl one set over here she's probably about Eight maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here mommy So she made her set with her which is cool and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid is trying to study her homework you know for I don't know was you up all night partying or was you up all night working you know or what the hell is your problem? 

Recording: (7007/ 9621) 
 I don't really see anybody. I was totally ready to vote for Elizabeth Dole and then she opened her mouth and things came out. She had the best chance out of any woman that's ever run for president. And she was in a major party, which hasn't happened before. And it would have been really funny to see what happened to Bob Dole over it. You know, be the first man after having run for the office. 

Recording: (7008/ 9621) 
 But then in the very next breath, they said, well, in two weeks, we're going to California to visit Paul. Now, anyhow, I was telling each of my children, because I was upset, and I was telling them this, and they're all going, oh, mom, my older girls are going, oh, you know. And my daughter, who's 13, is fabulous. She is so blunt. She's just so out there and so different from so many other children. And she said, well, do you actually care if he comes here? You don't care, do you? And I said, well, I don't care, but it makes me feel bad. It hurts my feelings. 

Recording: (7009/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7010/ 9621) 
 My personal belief is that they should be allowed to, because I believe they should have the male gender as well as the female gender for a proper bringing of them. 

Recording: (7011/ 9621) 
 You know, I think a lot of it depends on, I don't know if it's different parts of the country, but cultures and everything. Because you know, it just seems in some parts of the Midwest, but maybe Kentucky and West Virginia, it seems girls down there, a lot of them get married so young, that's just what they want to do. But they're not thinking of any future or wanting to go to college or anything like that. I have to cough, is it okay? I'm sorry. I didn't want to be like. 

Recording: (7012/ 9621) 
 That's why I'm here. 

Recording: (7013/ 9621) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (7014/ 9621) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (7015/ 9621) 
 or something like that, just for something to do. 

Recording: (7016/ 9621) 
 It happened sometime probably my freshman year in high school. We were just walking down high street and I guess we were in the wrong place at the wrong time and some people were like yelling stuff and we couldn't make out what they were saying. 

Recording: (7017/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh. 

Recording: (7018/ 9621) 
 First grade, the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed, but the principal wouldn't let her give it to him. He had to do what everybody else in the class was doing. He was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade. And at the last grading period, every day she'd give him a math paper to work on. He said, I showed you how to do this. I'm not doing it. 

Recording: (7019/ 9621) 
 Just things like a waste of legislation, money. 

Recording: (7020/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7021/ 9621) 
 You wanna know where I was born? 

Recording: (7022/ 9621) 
 And she's just like, yeah, the minute we walk in the door, it's like, you guys, clock out. 

Recording: (7023/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7024/ 9621) 
 As it was, Jake had sold the Northland Mall anyway, so it's probably gonna be like a strip mall more or less. 

Recording: (7025/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she lives over by Riverside Hospital. 

Recording: (7026/ 9621) 
 to marry him and she moved over and 

Recording: (7027/ 9621) 
 I mean as old as I am I still got that against him and that's what I want my son to keep. I want him to know his father and be around him even though he's not the best of person. 

Recording: (7028/ 9621) 
 Oh 

Recording: (7029/ 9621) 
 right 

Recording: (7030/ 9621) 
 We see that's not proved out by the the approval ratings He still has higher approval rating than Reagan had in his last 18 months So, you know people still like what he what he's done. I think that that That you know people don't like all the crap that went with him is the pundits on TV You know, they say that and they're they're still trying to get him I mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him which is what they would have done to Elizabeth Dole They wouldn't have been able to attack on the issue, so they'd find other things to get Iran, so they started bringing out all these women and all that stuff on. And most people didn't care about it. They didn't care about it before the election, they didn't care about it during his campaign, they didn't care about it during his presidency. It was some Republican right-wing, I don't know what, who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing. It was not Watergate. He may have been a cad, but she was 21. It's not like it was someone who couldn't make up her own mind what she wanted to do. And he may have been stupid and a cad, but I didn't want to know about it. On day one, when it hit the news, I didn't want to know about it. And on the end, when he was, you know, not impeached, I didn't want to know about it. And in between, I didn't want to know about it. And they just kept angering me because there were other things I wanted the government to do. And this Congress is the worst I've ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to be on the pulse of where America is on such issues as gun control and women's rights and things that are important to people. You know, they've tried to make pseudo issues out of Clinton and then they try to make a pseudo issue out of, you know, giving a tax cut. People don't want a tax cut when it's going to affect their social security or affect, you know, the deficit. 

Recording: (7031/ 9621) 
 I talked about this with my husband, like I said I don't have any kids yet and he keeps saying you don't want to just be worried that I roll over on the, or the people roll over on their babies, I don't see how you could roll over on anything that size and not know it. Unless you were on drugs or drunk or whatever. You know what I mean? 

Recording: (7032/ 9621) 
 I would like to teach. The field is particularly saturated right now, so I'm not holding out hopes for a teaching job. I mean, I'd like to think that I could distinguish myself within the field and get a job, but I mean, right now those jobs simply are not available. So I'm approaching things like whatever happens, happens. I'm gonna pursue my my interests and then go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about career plans after I finish my schooling. 

Recording: (7033/ 9621) 
 That's awfully young, but again, he's got this baby, yet they didn't talk about how this baby, how you make a baby, or everything associated, and I don't know if they should be talking about that yet, but here he is with this baby, and it's just like, okay. 

Recording: (7034/ 9621) 
 They're there. 

Recording: (7035/ 9621) 
 Definitely. I definitely the way I feel the death penalty is wrong but uh I Don't know people are always like oh, you know if your mother if your mother was killed God forbid But like you would want the death money, but honestly, I don't think I would I really like I'd feel anger towards that person but killing them it doesn't help me with my maybe the family say it helps with closure and everything, but I that me is, it's displacing my anger in a way that actually I don't think my victim that was so close to me would want me to do, you know? So. 

Recording: (7036/ 9621) 
 And then while she was out there, she met a cowboy who was also from Ohio. And they were married while they were out there, I guess. But she was, as my son used to say, she was a piece of work. She had definite ideas about it, putting her everything. 

Recording: (7037/ 9621) 
 Oh, why? And here I come from, this is a gentleman that's dark skinned. I don't know if he's black or colored. I'm still confused as to what the difference between black and colored is. But he says, my brothers probably came to these islands, to the Continental. They come down here and they're getting all, they're swaying themselves, They're acting cocky to me and so forth I say We don't do that here And I said, well I know this, you know There's a lot of black population here Creole mix and that type of thing Which I would consider colored not black To me black black is black. If you have anything mixed in it, it's colored. But he said we don't do that. He said the problem in the States, guys you guys, daddy wants, kid wants a car, get him a car. Down here, John when he comes from school, I gave him a dinner by asking him to sleep off the front porch. Now I'll still give him his dinner, but I ask him please, did you do your sleep off the front porch? May not sound much, but at least I'm trying to teach him something. And you saw a lot of that down there in the people where we were down in Frederikberg. But it's just those things, you learn, and then there's other times I was down in Jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw very impoverished areas. 

Recording: (7038/ 9621) 
 Secretarial administrative assistant type work. 

Recording: (7039/ 9621) 
 It's 

Recording: (7040/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you know, I've just come to, I always prefer for my children and myself, I mean, if there's anything Disney, I usually go and watch it, you know, at the movie theater. And after a while, it's like, I think Beauty and the Beast is where it really came through to me. It's like, that's a wonderful story, but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle, right in the middle of it? 

Recording: (7041/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that was it. That's hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again. You're just like, wow, wait, what were those people thinking? 

Recording: (7042/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7043/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7044/ 9621) 
 There has been some serious consideration, but no, there was some a lot someone took up a petition and was urging him to do it But he's decided he did not want to Oprah is one of them. And all those other people, it's just like her. And of course, they get into the smut and everything else and what they've done and all that malarkey. And I think he decided he had to do the same thing on his program, or for him to keep his ratings up. So, and see, that's what you mean by getting into what this person does over here. And that's another thing we need to teach our kids, because John Doe, Jane Doe is doing it, does have farmers, we have politicians. What else we got in there? We have professors. 

Recording: (7045/ 9621) 
 I think he's. 

Recording: (7046/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7047/ 9621) 
 It's much fun as it was the first time. I just not. 

Recording: (7048/ 9621) 
 It's crazy because everybody wants to buy us everything. And I've got, oh my gosh, they're like, just give me a list. And somebody's like, I want to get this, and I want to get that. So it's just been something else, which is good, though, because our families are pretty similar, and they're all 

Recording: (7049/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7050/ 9621) 
 civil rights only went so far. They haven't corrected the wrongs in the past. They haven't created a sense in our society that anyone can achieve. Like the American dream, in my opinion, is an absolute lie. 

Recording: (7051/ 9621) 
 And they were just wild, you know. I just ran every minute. And I took it as a substitute and didn't know from day to day, you know, whether it's going to keep it. I finally had to say, I can't do this. Twenty-seven kindergartens. I'm sorry, I can't do this by myself. 

Recording: (7052/ 9621) 
 Really? So is it, is that so like the economy's pretty good right now? Well, right now. It's shaky? Okay. Not too many dot coms apparently over there. 

Recording: (7053/ 9621) 
 Well, I'm gonna speak from my relationship. My dad was out of town quite a bit when we were growing up. So from a maternal aspect, you know, mom was there all the time. And a lot of times she filled both the male and the female, the mother and the father role, you know, as far as punishment and everything like that. But it just would depend depend I know in my respect it would have been a lot better I think for myself and everything, you know, I mean for you know, we would have been able to had Joint custody with her and everything, you know when she was growing up because from or by her being out there I mean, you know, you can just imagine she's, and being a girl, not saying anything bad about girls, but being my daughter, you know, worried about things in school and weekends and stuff like that. So, or if I was closer to her, I wouldn't worry so much about it. 

Recording: (7054/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7055/ 9621) 
 And it got broken into. And, you know, he's paying rent on this apartment and he's back home. Because the police said that this apartment has been hit many times. So it's just a big mess right now, you know. He had a nice, you know, his better clothes stolen, his jewelry, a few other minor things. But he didn't want his TV and VCR and those kind of things to get stolen, so he moved them back home. And then he started worrying about something else, and that moves back. Then he's worried about his car because somebody down the street got their car stolen. So it's just going to be a matter of rearranging. He's applying for another scholarship. He gets some already. So if he would get this other scholarship, I think it would help him be able to move into the fraternity. I think he can get out of the apartment by subleasing it. But he has to get the $75 to give to the landlord. They charge $75 to do that, to advertise and screen. 

Recording: (7056/ 9621) 
 I mean obviously everyone has their dark side, but I'd say in general people are pretty good people. 

Recording: (7057/ 9621) 
 아... 

Recording: (7058/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (7059/ 9621) 
 I moved into the dorms late September, last fall. 

Recording: (7060/ 9621) 
 with 

Recording: (7061/ 9621) 
 why I wouldn't push it on him. Because that's almost made me be resentful towards being Catholic, just the fact that I had it forced on me. 

Recording: (7062/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (7063/ 9621) 
 Well, the Wolf family and the McConnells have been around forever, you know, Worthington Industries and the Wolf family, as close as dispatch. Then you got, I think it's Rizzuti, who's like a, what is it, construction guy. So, they've been around forever and everything, and they can get their ways through political arenas and everything. But I think most of the money was was private money, but they were given like tax incentives and things of that nature 

Recording: (7064/ 9621) 
 It's pretty much a ritzy place. 

Recording: (7065/ 9621) 
 And yeah, I would never want to go back to the old way, never. 

Recording: (7066/ 9621) 
 And field artillery is really interesting, I found it really interesting because when you get into figuring firing data, 

Recording: (7067/ 9621) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (7068/ 9621) 
 I said that and he's like. 

Recording: (7069/ 9621) 
 What it is is most people don't want kids to live in reality. 

Recording: (7070/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7071/ 9621) 
 And no legal sanctions are going to make any particular difference to the attitude you have going into it. 

Recording: (7072/ 9621) 
 That's a roundabout way of getting there. 

Recording: (7073/ 9621) 
 I wouldn't doubt it. I hope they vote against it, but I don't think they will. 

Recording: (7074/ 9621) 
 It's kind of hard when you've got your limited choices here. Some of the issues I thought were kind of important, but when you're looking at the mayoral candidates... Did you watch that debate? 

Recording: (7075/ 9621) 
 because it stops your heart right away. 

Recording: (7076/ 9621) 
 No, I don't think so. 

Recording: (7077/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7078/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7079/ 9621) 
 And 

Recording: (7080/ 9621) 
 But there's things that are difficult like there is that where we go we we have a temple too and They can't go in the temple well, they can but they have to Fit certain criteria. They have to be baptized and not and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and but that's not what they're interested in doing so and that's hard, I think. And going on a mission, they didn't understand that. My dad was like, do they know how small you are? They're sending you to Siberia. 

Recording: (7081/ 9621) 
 Well, when you think about the different generations and things, we certainly didn't have the things to worry about that people do now. When I was in elementary and junior high, we would have never dreamed of anybody having a good gun, or even let alone a knife. I mean, that's violence, and that goes back to kids and how much time and effort you put into them. Kids are ignored and pushed aside, and they're in the way, and there's so many people that don't even want them. And then they get into school and they get violent and they take it out and everybody's surprised. I'm not because I know there's a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids. And going to school is going to be so dangerous, I think, because you have so many of them in one little room and they're coming from so many different backgrounds. And if you take each one of their situations, I can bet the statistics as time goes on that they're not going to have one caring parent, you know, maybe not even one of the parents, you know, they might have a foster family or, you know, somebody that wants to pretend like they care. There's a lot of people that are foster families that only want the money. And there's all that. So it's really scary and I think that something has to be done real fast. I don't know what. I think it starts from what we teach them and as adults what we allow to be out there. The computers, I mean, oh my gosh, I didn't even get a computer because I was so afraid of what they could be able to access. There was nothing barred at all when they first came out. Yeah. And you know, where are all those software people? They're not responsible for Y2K, they're not responsible for all this internet access to all this stuff. So it's really hard. 

Recording: (7082/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7083/ 9621) 
 I swear it's possessed. If I could figure out how to work FDisk and format in DOS, I might be able to figure out what my problem is. Because I started running Windows 2000 about three months ago. That was a dumb mistake. One of the guys in my house is a software pirate and he got me a copy of 2000. He was like, dude, your computer will run 2000. Let's put it on your computer. 

Recording: (7084/ 9621) 
 older kids. 

Recording: (7085/ 9621) 
 Well, you have to try some different things, like put on headphones with music that doesn't have any words and try to read somewhere. 

Recording: (7086/ 9621) 
 Never I used to Have an office out there that business all the time, but I've never been out there to she actually lives in Kirkwood which is a suburb 

Recording: (7087/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (7088/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (7089/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (7090/ 9621) 
 Hahahahaha 

Recording: (7091/ 9621) 
 Hmm? 

Recording: (7092/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's mainly what happens is you get all the out of town bad stuff. I mean, it just kind of absorbs like a sponge. 

Recording: (7093/ 9621) 
 Well, I believe it's quality, not quantity. Ideally, one parent would be there, be it male or female, you know, man or wife, man or lady. But, you know, your quality time is more important. You know, if you come home and all you want to do is sit down and start watching TV or drinking beer or whatever, you know, not spending any time with your child, it doesn't matter whether you're there all day or whether you're there for two hours. 

Recording: (7094/ 9621) 
 It's just bazooka! 

Recording: (7095/ 9621) 
 I have no idea. It's kind of like picking the least of evils. 

Recording: (7096/ 9621) 
 lol 

Recording: (7097/ 9621) 
 mhm 

Recording: (7098/ 9621) 
 And my mother was always there for me. I would just call my mom, like, what can I do? And she's just like, calm down, Rachel, just calm down. 

Recording: (7099/ 9621) 
 Go, go, go. So it's tough. 

Recording: (7100/ 9621) 
 Well, it's not how it's put into effect, the law. It's how it's enforced. You don't just say, well, little Johnny stuck his finger in a pie and you can't do that anymore. The more security you're going to have over that pie, the more he's going to want it. And going into the gun thing, it's pretty much nobody's winning game. I mean, you make stricter laws, you're gonna get, you know, even more and more people, you know, struggling to get a gun and shoot somebody's head off. So, the school thing pretty much says itself, metal detectors and police at the schools. It's come down to that nowadays. Any gun you get from criminals should, I mean, they already melt them at Buckeye Steel, but there's a little bit more you can do with those than burn them. You know, you could set them up in some kind of top secret lab, you know, out in DC somewhere. The Pentagon just have rooms and rooms stacked full of guns and I mean, hell, in case we have to do have to go to war, you know, just keep that little reserve. 

Recording: (7101/ 9621) 
 Damn it. 

Recording: (7102/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (7103/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's difficult. 

Recording: (7104/ 9621) 
 And. 

Recording: (7105/ 9621) 
 Not really, I mean, yeah, there's some little flaws, but. 

Recording: (7106/ 9621) 
 just like premarital sex. I mean, there was no way I would ever discuss anything like that ever with her. I mean, that was just something that you didn't 

Recording: (7107/ 9621) 
 We don't know who's in the airplane, but there are seaplanes that do come in and out of there. 

Recording: (7108/ 9621) 
 They probably would have been about seniors in high school or so. 

Recording: (7109/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (7110/ 9621) 
 They just pretty much deliver papers, go to class, wrestling, sleep. 

Recording: (7111/ 9621) 
 Desert. 

Recording: (7112/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (7113/ 9621) 
 And they're not willing to do that for gifted students. 

Recording: (7114/ 9621) 
 Absolutely. 

Recording: (7115/ 9621) 
 And I'd been there three, four days, and finally at breakfast one morning, Henry said, well, you haven't talked about Clinton and the impeachment yet. And I said, Henry, because he's the Republican, I said, I don't even want to go there. I said, I don't even think we want to get involved in that conversation. He said, well, I can understand you saying that, but I want to tell you where I am. He said, when this whole thing started, I sat down and wrote every one of my New Jersey representatives, all of my senators, and all of the Congress people New Jersey and told them that I will never ever in my life vote Republican again because of the way this has played out. I mean this was a Republican, a lifelong Republican. He says I will always now vote Democrat because this was just so stupid and such a waste of my time, the country's time, the country's money when there are better things to be dealing with. And a lot of Republicans felt that way. You've got to be really extreme right wing to feel other than that. Except here in Central Ohio. 

Recording: (7116/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7117/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7118/ 9621) 
 I think it would help. I do. I am against religion in school. I just don't think they should push that on people. 

Recording: (7119/ 9621) 
 Originally Northside. 

Recording: (7120/ 9621) 
 People that just really want to teach as opposed to like, I don't know why other people want to like even went into teaching at all, you know, but I think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal, not so this is, you know, you do this to get this certain grade. It's like you do this to learn this because it's interesting as opposed to like, and I don't know. I think it's like there's a lot of things that it's more Compulsory education is weird like being forced to take this class like I think that if I I mean it's good to being forced to take abroad like a liberal arts thing because like you don't know what you want to do so it's like if like you hate math and you don't take it at all, but then you decide you want to do something in math and you're like screwed like can't go back and 

Recording: (7121/ 9621) 
 I don't know that much detail, but most times it comes down to a lack of knowing your children, how they're going to react to certain things. I don't know the details of the thing other than the fact that there seems like a lot of envy going on with them. I think that's part of the problem we have in our life. It would be very difficult, I think, in traveling if you say you say okay I'm going to give up this life here and go to the third world and live. Or let's do, let's reverse busing. Hey okay Upper Arlington you live on the northwest side why don't you go down and live on the east side. 

Recording: (7122/ 9621) 
 77. 

Recording: (7123/ 9621) 
 So there was a couple people that went, but probably two out of 500, nobody wanted to move. So I stayed here. 

Recording: (7124/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (7125/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (7126/ 9621) 
 Hehe, oh yeah! 

Recording: (7127/ 9621) 
 You could argue both of those too, but I mean personally I'd say that's just teaching them more than what they need to know. I think that's a little bit too much. 

Recording: (7128/ 9621) 
 Wow, it's not every Sunday anymore, but it was for a long time. It was for a long time. 

Recording: (7129/ 9621) 
 I think he's in prison and he has no driver's license privileges for life. And it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff. 

Recording: (7130/ 9621) 
 I don't whether I've ever pointed out this this out to you But he happened to be one of my fellow students out of Ohio University Now how he happened to learn all these things like he did I don't know I didn't Chris he started out he I think the very first thing he was a township trustee like Paul was and then he ultimately became the mayor of Cincinnati and he was a very effective, oh yeah, he was very, very effective. He was well liked. 

Recording: (7131/ 9621) 
 Heh. 

Recording: (7132/ 9621) 
 She's been very mature about it. And she has, they are working out an arrangement with the 

Recording: (7133/ 9621) 
 It's always been my feeling and I try to be fair in the way I grade. I try to be as objective as I can. Sometimes, because I think it's important that people learn how to write, I would ask all my classes to write an essay or a short 

Recording: (7134/ 9621) 
 for more. 

Recording: (7135/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7136/ 9621) 
 It wasn't at the time, but you live in. 

Recording: (7137/ 9621) 
 Columbus 

Recording: (7138/ 9621) 
 I'll go ahead if you. 

Recording: (7139/ 9621) 
 Just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness, forgiveness is granted, whatever. 

Recording: (7140/ 9621) 
 Um, it would a little bit, but at the same time, I mean, it was obviously a long time ago. I mean, I don't know how, how far in the past you have to go for things to be considered a problem with something coming up again. Um, I mean, as long as he's not, didn't have any history of being like an addicted user or anything like that. I mean, I, I can't say it really bothers me too much. 

Recording: (7141/ 9621) 
 My husband is black. 

Recording: (7142/ 9621) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (7143/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7144/ 9621) 
 He said he's gonna kick my you know what and everything. I said, well, I'll be outside, you know. 

Recording: (7145/ 9621) 
 go to right right right well i started going to sunday school when i was five or six years old 

Recording: (7146/ 9621) 
 I thought this was something like maybe unique to the States. 

Recording: (7147/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he was up there too. The old guy with the beard and the tweed jacket. It was pretty cool. And they said most of the students are not even from Delaware. 

Recording: (7148/ 9621) 
 They have this thing about, the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breastfed have higher IQs. 

Recording: (7149/ 9621) 
 Just getting over there. 

Recording: (7150/ 9621) 
 My dad is remarried. 

Recording: (7151/ 9621) 
 We're finished. 

Recording: (7152/ 9621) 
 Excuse me. 

Recording: (7153/ 9621) 
 or put you in peak or something, if there's any problems between students. I don't think they never would sit down with the students and have them talk it out. They might send them to peak or something. 

Recording: (7154/ 9621) 
 Like. 

Recording: (7155/ 9621) 
 Well, you have to. 

Recording: (7156/ 9621) 
 So there's, from what I hear, one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it. 

Recording: (7157/ 9621) 
 Oh, they're very good. Like, you call. I usually just call and I walk down and by the time I get there, the subs are ready. 

Recording: (7158/ 9621) 
 The problem is lack of commitment. Lack of commitment and not saying, hey, there's a niche for you. You can't be a male. Oh, yeah, you want to do the operation? I can't be female. Yeah, you want to do it. Well, why not be happy what you are? God made you what you are. Why not make you the complete person you are and not strive for something you can't be? 

Recording: (7159/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7160/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (7161/ 9621) 
 It's a real different thing. I mean, you can understand why it'd be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours when, you know, you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on. But he used to always, he would come home from work and then go back to work after they were in bed so that I wouldn't have to deal with it the whole time. 

Recording: (7162/ 9621) 
 What's embarrassing? 

Recording: (7163/ 9621) 
 Um, 

Recording: (7164/ 9621) 
 It is. 

Recording: (7165/ 9621) 
 I'd like to see that implemented, something like that in the United States. That'd be a neat thing, you know, because like I know like Iron Foundry's and some like, like the lower paying jobs, like they hire people that are illiterate and things like that and they can't like give paychecks out on Thursdays because everyone will call off on Fridays because they all go out and get drunk or I don't know what they do with their paychecks. I know that's a big, big problem. 

Recording: (7166/ 9621) 
 You know, when I hear about kids 12, 13, luckily I wasn't that early, but I think once they start, you know, like sixth grade, they really should relate to them. 

Recording: (7167/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (7168/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7169/ 9621) 
 And it's kind of weird because when I went from middle school to high school, it was like a big growing up period. And I see them like, what are you doing that for? 

Recording: (7170/ 9621) 
 Right, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, every night. 

Recording: (7171/ 9621) 
 Now they are. Well, my mom feeds them very well. She probably thinks, oh, they're like her green kids. 

Recording: (7172/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's one of the drawbacks. 

Recording: (7173/ 9621) 
 No, I knew I wouldn't change my mind on that either. I'm pretty strong-willed about things. 

Recording: (7174/ 9621) 
 But everybody in my family is mechanically inclined. 

Recording: (7175/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7176/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7177/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7178/ 9621) 
 I'd get more people asking me for that. And I mean, it turns out pretty nice. I'm making about 10 or 11 bucks an hour. 

Recording: (7179/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't think I could vote for a violent president. I could vote for a president that made some mistakes with their personal life. 

Recording: (7180/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (7181/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7182/ 9621) 
 Well, I thought it went the way it was supposed to go. 

Recording: (7183/ 9621) 
 I hope your father doesn't drink. 

Recording: (7184/ 9621) 
 and he could see, assume he's educated and not stupid, otherwise he wouldn't be a magistrate, could see that that person did that. 

Recording: (7185/ 9621) 
 Um, about six, yeah. Did we get her? We've had her for two years. Yeah, we did. About six months. We went to Hawaii and got his brother married. And then we came back. We knew that would be the last long trip. And we were going to wait until the spring, but we couldn't. So we went to a rescue service and got her. Yeah. 

Recording: (7186/ 9621) 
 I mean, most men are dogs, yeah. 

Recording: (7187/ 9621) 
 But that's kind of, you know, it kind of came through where they were like, when I was growing up, we had the, you know, you had your jocks and everything, of course, and you had your, we were called duds, you know. And I was kind of like in the middle, you know. I played a little bit of sport, you know, but I also associated with them, and they were basically potheads, you know everything so So I could say I you know, I was kind of associated with both of them but then the football players, you know, some of them were pretty Pretty much asses, you know No other way to put especially if they were got scholarships and stuff, you know, they were and they could be real Nasty but I Just can't sign a knife. Thank me. I look at it back. It's like oh I've got into arguments with a few of them and seen him later on, you know, and It's like a man, you know I buy a beer, you know, whatever, you know, sorry about what happened. We were Five years ago, you know, I didn't buy you a beer or whatever. Sorry about what happened. It should have happened five years ago. I try to forget things. My mind's got enough to absorb without worrying about, which I do worry quite a bit about things, but stupid stuff like that. Somebody gets mad at you because you're You're not a jock or you know, you're you're you're you're this or you're that you know, everybody trying to label people and stuff 

Recording: (7188/ 9621) 
 I think 

Recording: (7189/ 9621) 
 They think everything they say is hilarious. Oh, it's just middle school. I think it's transitioning from childhood to adulthood is a tough time. And when you have all the other things going on, like you can't read and you can't write and you can't spell, then it's just even worse. It's exacerbated even more. So I get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class. 

Recording: (7190/ 9621) 
 I think outside of the honors program a lot of it is, but within the honors program I think there's some really, really exceptional things going on. 

Recording: (7191/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, yep. 

Recording: (7192/ 9621) 
 And it's very hard on my wife, I don't know. But we'll get through it. 

Recording: (7193/ 9621) 
 Yeah, imagine you learned it in a hurry. 

Recording: (7194/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and they're all so different, but he deals real well with people. So he's really, and he's even thinking of going into business for himself. Yeah, he almost did that this year, and then he thought, no, I don't want all the headaches. So he's like the top guy of the people that he works for. 

Recording: (7195/ 9621) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (7196/ 9621) 
 So I do hope that she does, she is a good writer, I do hope that someday she can be able to do that. 

Recording: (7197/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (7198/ 9621) 
 and people don't. 

Recording: (7199/ 9621) 
 Yeah and I was really young when I met my husband I was 14 in high school so we kind of grew up together I didn't know anything else and just two complete different people you know different needs and everything else so 

Recording: (7200/ 9621) 
 Are you dead? 

Recording: (7201/ 9621) 
 God, do what? 

Recording: (7202/ 9621) 
 And he's very opinionated. And it's interesting when he talks about anything. He loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing. You can tell that he's thought about it and has clearly formulated what his stance is on it. And he's very articulate about it. Sometimes his responses are immature, but he's 19. 

Recording: (7203/ 9621) 
 Selling time for money, yes. 

Recording: (7204/ 9621) 
 Well, obviously I sort of surmounted that because I've been, you know, I've spent a lot of time there since then. I think had I only studied there for a semester or a quarter, I would have come back with a completely different attitude. But I was there for a whole year, so the first few months were a little bit difficult. But then, you know, after that, you know, you just sort of, you know, get to the point where you just kind of, you know, laugh it off and just think, oh, here we go again. 

Recording: (7205/ 9621) 
 some ideas about it. I figured it's something I should know about. 

Recording: (7206/ 9621) 
 It's not necessarily because of necessity. More often than not, maybe even today it's less than that. It doesn't depend because of a loss of a parent or inability of a parent or parents being able to handle those children. So yes, those things do exist and they will always have some, but that's a very him go down the drain. And I think that that's what adoption is and you're really accepting this responsibility and that's love. And when you're trying and willing to have, well some people probably argue about this, but I'm sorry if God did not mean that I can conceive and have my own child, why should I try to implant somebody else's inside of me and produce it? I mean, I would rather go out and see this other child that really needs help and adopt that baby. Because you can see them and you can help them and you're already aware to a certain extent of what genes they might have inherited and what problems you might be getting. Sometimes you don't. Later on you'll find out. But still, you can go back and you can find the parent and I don't know whether they're going to be able to trace these genes back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you're having and Find out well, what did they inherit over here? But if you've adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

Recording: (7207/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7208/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7209/ 9621) 
 He knows, they show a picture, oh that's who man chewers. 

Recording: (7210/ 9621) 
 Well, we don't want to know. She's the only one that wants to know. Her boyfriend, he doesn't want to know either. So Sarah decided that she could not go and find out the sex of it because she couldn't keep a secret. So anyhow, we just don't know. 

Recording: (7211/ 9621) 
 Wow. I don't know if there could be, there are certain programs, different community-based programs, getting, but again, those are my values. As I say, steering the kids into a church-based program if they can't be there, putting them with families and friends that you know and trust to look after them, giving them the guidance that they need. The YMCA programs are wonderful. They give them a structured activity to do where they're supervised. But again, those programs a lot of times cost money that the families don't have, and it may not be their values to put them in those type of programs.

Recording: (7213/ 9621) 
 I don't think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries. It's just too long. People start tuning out and there's only so much you can say. And it's like the candidates 

Recording: (7214/ 9621) 
 And I don't agree with that either. 

Recording: (7215/ 9621) 
 I thought I would expect that from dogs. I mean, yeah, a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff, but in broad daylight... 

Recording: (7216/ 9621) 
 I know, I know, I know. I mean, I started. 

Recording: (7217/ 9621) 
 Well I had a driver down here last time so I'm going to bring her back. If she doesn't come back I might as well come with her. I'm just kidding we went to get something to eat and I dropped her off and she took the bus home. 

Recording: (7218/ 9621) 
 My dad, like... 

Recording: (7219/ 9621) 
 When in the 50s and 60s you very seldom saw black people on TV and then you start seeing a couple of black people on TV and then there was the Jeffersons and although I found the Jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and made fun of black people, in many ways in retrospect it was trend setting. And what it did, and even in putting blacks in advertisements on TV, young kids saw them and saw those ads and saw those TV programs and so it became a part of everyday life. And the more you see something, the more it becomes more acceptable. So maybe that is having an effect. Maybe 50 years from now we'll look back on those TV programs and think they were trendsetting instead of stereotypical. But I'm sure it does have some influence because I think it did. It wasn't the only thing that had an influence, but it was one of the little pieces of the puzzle that helps. I think Matthew Shepard helped also. 

Recording: (7220/ 9621) 
 Right. I think teaching band might be fun because I think you only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there, whether you were well behaved, yeah, and whether you're trying to play your instrument. I don't think we ever got A's, B's, and C's. Yeah. 

Recording: (7221/ 9621) 
 I haven't been anywhere except for Canada and Niagara Falls. I was about three years old. That's when my dad died while we was up there no less. 

Recording: (7222/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (7223/ 9621) 
 And... 

Recording: (7224/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7225/ 9621) 
 you know, somebody lied to you buddy. He said they were just looking at him like, you know, no way. They were like, nah. 

Recording: (7226/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (7227/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7228/ 9621) 
 violence. 

Recording: (7229/ 9621) 
 I don't think it's necessarily that. I think it comes back to the lack of self-discipline. 

Recording: (7230/ 9621) 
 at cosi. 

Recording: (7231/ 9621) 
 The reason that it was one of the best years of my life is it's an incredibly beautiful setting and the people that came to participate in that were very, very high people. And it was mostly, of course, young people, but they were incredibly idealistic and incredibly searching for answers in, I mean, their questions and their conversations. Talk about opinions. As a matter of fact, that's the only thing I felt difficult about living there was they would be asking all these incredible questions and I would be trying to do the dishes or something mundane like that. It's like I don't want to do the dishes, I just want to answer the questions. 

Recording: (7232/ 9621) 
 They're supposed to be not physically possible. It goes against the first law of physics. But I saw it happen. 

Recording: (7233/ 9621) 
 So that works out pretty well. 

Recording: (7234/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7235/ 9621) 
 the beginning of the end. Yep, I grew up in Upper Arlington. Yeah, really, those five miles make such a difference though. Yeah, because I live on campus. 

Recording: (7236/ 9621) 
 Those things are hard as hell to scratch. 

Recording: (7237/ 9621) 
 you know. So unfortunately, you know, and I guess I never thought of it, a lot more pressure is put on schools and education now. 

Recording: (7238/ 9621) 
 where they can go every day, the way I look at it. Also, too, when I was a kid, like I said, I started working two jobs when I was 14. You can't even find a job unless you're 16 nowadays. 

Recording: (7239/ 9621) 
 It's considered urban, but because it's north of Akron, we play like a lot of like the inner city like in Akron schools. But in my opinion, it's suburbia like, but we have the we have the big city problems like there's a lot of drugs. And I think that's just because the building is old, so no one really takes pride in it. And then it's 2,000 people. 

Recording: (7240/ 9621) 
 Well, when he first started out. 

Recording: (7241/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (7242/ 9621) 
 graphic design in particular. After I quit wrestling I got really into computers so I pretty much live on my computer now. 

Recording: (7243/ 9621) 
 And my sister was here, like I said, and then moved out. Just came back a couple months ago. My grandfather just passed away, but he was here in a nursing home for about a year. 

Recording: (7244/ 9621) 
 Do you think that's because students are really sort of the dorms too and I really I really didn't like that like it was like I don't know it's like living in a hotel or something it was really weird and like 

Recording: (7245/ 9621) 
 I have sex. 

Recording: (7246/ 9621) 
 Because there's some people that actually can't work. 

Recording: (7247/ 9621) 
 Right. Yep. But $50 a week. 

Recording: (7248/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7249/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7250/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I hadn't thought about that. No, I don't get the impression that value says anything to do with what they're doing in this school. 

Recording: (7251/ 9621) 
 But... 

Recording: (7252/ 9621) 
 They'll also let them work 75% if they're sick. I had a heart attack, had to come back to work early because I was out of sick leave. And like I said, I've been here 25 years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it wasn't a good enough reason. 

Recording: (7253/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (7254/ 9621) 
 They always find some silly way to slain his words and make him look bad and it's really disgusting. 

Recording: (7255/ 9621) 
 I know that's a lot easier said than done because you fall in love every other week sometimes when you're young. But I don't think it encourages it. I just think, you know, they show so much on TV. It's all, you know, people are nude at 10 o'clock at night on these shows and these girls are watching it. I mean granted most of them are adults but on the soap operas and stuff it's a different story. So they're seeing it anyways. You just, I think if you're open enough with your children, these parents, and say, we want to give you this option. We prefer you don't do this. But if you decide to do it, we want you to be protected. 

Recording: (7256/ 9621) 
 Okay. I better go. 

Recording: (7257/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah 

Recording: (7258/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7259/ 9621) 
 There was snow or something. 

Recording: (7260/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7261/ 9621) 
 where they were going and he worked in a trailer out in the yards. 

Recording: (7262/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7263/ 9621) 
 Well, there was a house I didn't want it, so that was easy. 

Recording: (7264/ 9621) 
 Oh no. 

Recording: (7265/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (7266/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they're Russian Orthodox, same, basically the same thing. 

Recording: (7267/ 9621) 
 So we're talking an extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are, how they work. So class one was demystifying the computer. We took it apart, we labeled everything inside, I gave them all a piece, I said put it back together. We turned it on, we saw if it worked, we went back in, figured out why it didn't work, took it apart again. This wasn't so that they can do hardware, because hardware has no money in it. But it was so that they're not scared of the magic box. 

Recording: (7268/ 9621) 
 Okay, no, I haven't been following it really. 

Recording: (7269/ 9621) 
 That's what traveling does, it makes you appreciate what you got. Makes you realize all the things you do have and makes you feel like, wow. Actually, pretty much nowhere. That's why I want a book. Exactly. Not too much, not just studying. Like you realize, teaching and studying takes up a lot of time. 

Recording: (7270/ 9621) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (7271/ 9621) 
 And a damn thing they're scared of when I we were kids we used to make zip guns We take an ink pen take the pen piece out put a firecracker in 

Recording: (7272/ 9621) 
 That would be the closest mall to me is Northland. It's convenient for me. 

Recording: (7273/ 9621) 
 Yeah I just wear my glasses for more for you know reading. I can see far away. 

Recording: (7274/ 9621) 
 you know, when he can wrestle with them and all that. Right now he's just, he sits there and when he cries he goes, what does he want? Like I know, go down the list, hun, change his diaper. If he, it's been three hours since he's had a bottle, give him a bottle, you know. 

Recording: (7275/ 9621) 
 No, mom, we don't want to do that because they don't want to have to be responsible for them at school and wherever. 

Recording: (7276/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7277/ 9621) 
 here. 

Recording: (7278/ 9621) 
 I lived, I actually went there for interior design. I lived right off the street. 

Recording: (7279/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (7280/ 9621) 
 The more laid back. 

Recording: (7281/ 9621) 
 You're going to cross the street, you know, four-lane highway, and you're sitting there going, 

Recording: (7282/ 9621) 
 I really don't think we're incredibly racist. 

Recording: (7283/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7284/ 9621) 
 well. 

Recording: (7285/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7286/ 9621) 
 I can't wait till mine's crawling and or walking and all that and he can take you to places and you have to carry him you can hold his hand 

Recording: (7287/ 9621) 
 bring what's in your heart out. And sometimes you'll say stuff that doesn't even make sense, but you say it and it brings it out. And that's what it's for. So, I mean, it's a struggle understanding that. And I made it through all four rounds this time. And I even sat up, which was the first time It's a struggle but it's uh It's necessary for the way I follow if it didn't especially for men women have a purification every month 

Recording: (7288/ 9621) 
 at this point I stopped for a moment and I'm just like so nobody can think their divorce was so important that I need to sit down to deal with it because I obviously I have a curiosity that something whack is afoot. And so I'm like okay, I sit down. Your father killed himself this morning. And I said oh. And then there's like a sort of a white out period there. So you don't get like decent details on what occurred. I don't actually think anything exciting occurred. I think mostly it was me and my sister on my lap and me smelling my sister's wet, stinky hair, because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason. So wet, stinky hair, wet because I was crying into it, and then more time passes. So some indeterminate length of time later, I look over at the police officer who's standing on one side. And the cops are there basically to make sure I don't freak out. And that's finally sunk in. I was like, the cops are here so you don't freak. I'm like, well I'm not really in any danger of freaking out, am I? And then you look at the first officer and you're like, oh what would freaking out look like? You would never know. That's why the cops are here. Oh, okay. Well, that makes more sense. I was like, OK. So I looked over at the car. I said, I have a friend upstairs. And I wasn't able to put on anything more than that. And he didn't come out anywhere near that well. 

Recording: (7289/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7290/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7291/ 9621) 
 Um, just get away from my parents for a while. You know, it's kind of good for me just to be away. It's part of the experience. Like, learning to do my own laundry and stuff, I used to be so bad about it and now all of a sudden I don't care really. 

Recording: (7292/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7293/ 9621) 
 all this other stuff. 

Recording: (7294/ 9621) 
 I know. Well, you get to take advantage of it for layovers and stuff. 

Recording: (7295/ 9621) 
 their daycare? I don't know, it's tough. I think, really, I believe more in that large corporations need to have some kind of daycare offered. It's just there's not that many people anymore that can afford to have a one-income family. I mean, you know, we could do it, you know, but, you know, we wouldn't live as nice as we do. We wouldn't have as nice of cars as we do, you know, we'd struggle a little more. So, so it's a toss-up. It's a real 

Recording: (7296/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, he taught math. But they had a general curriculum. It was just like he taught seventh grade. They gave him math, science, supposedly social studies, all the stuff that, I mean, it was very poorly run to begin with. So we would go out and try and find books for the kids. And you heard that he hadn't bought them books. So we had to buy them. I mean, they got reimbursed, but it was just ridiculous. So they were trying to do anything they could just to keep their jobs and keep the school. 

Recording: (7297/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7298/ 9621) 
 Harry, yeah, I'm like, oh my God, what did we do? Like my grandmother's name was Olive. When I was born, my dad said, why, she looks just like your mother, to my mom. And I've turned out to do everything that she did. I've turned out to teach. She was a teacher. I've turned out to be, you know, real good in the kitchen and baking. And I do like crafts, like she did knitting and crocheting, and I do that. But I'm sure glad they didn't name me Olive. 

Recording: (7299/ 9621) 
 Nah, we're just both having to work there. 

Recording: (7300/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (7301/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7302/ 9621) 
 Yeah. The one thing they've done is they've put on bigger airplanes. Because it used to be, you know, like a, say a 737 would go from here to New York City and now it's a 757. So that adds more seats. So instead of, because when I first got there I couldn't understand it at OSU when it was like Christmas time or something, it would just, you drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you're like, oh boy. 

Recording: (7303/ 9621) 
 Nothing. I mean his mom and his dad are cool and 

Recording: (7304/ 9621) 
 Poor people can't do that. So after all was said and done with her case, she was left with about a million dollars. And then out of that million, the attorney and the firm got a third, plus she had to pay office expenses. So really, she was probably left with only about $300,000, which if used wisely, okay, maybe she could have. But it sounded to me like she didn't have a money problem anyway. She was a corporate person, but a very stupid person. So I mean that's basically my battle with the legal system. I've got a person right now that owes me $500 that I wanted to take to small claims court. I even got the canceled check to prove it and everything. But, you know, when I look at what the alternative is, which is subjecting myself to unfairness, even though I feel I got it concrete, no way, you know, those are the ones, I mean, I'd have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one I can find right now is $145 an hour. 

Recording: (7305/ 9621) 
 It's his dad, his dad's dad, and his dad's dad. 

Recording: (7306/ 9621) 
 he takes care of his. So to me, that's more important. 

Recording: (7307/ 9621) 
 I tried to wait, I guess a couple weeks I'll be having another. 

Recording: (7308/ 9621) 
 Fort Hayes. 

Recording: (7309/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7310/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7311/ 9621) 
 need 

Recording: (7312/ 9621) 
 I don't want to do anything until past January. Since 1974, I've never had Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year's off without having to work either a 7 to 3 or a 3 to 11. I figure I deserve this. It's about time I get to not eat Thanksgiving dinner at 10.30 in the morning so I can go to work at noon or something, or open the Christmas presents at 5 o'clock in the afternoon because I work Christmas Day. I think it's my time. 

Recording: (7313/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (7314/ 9621) 
 I don't think so. 

Recording: (7315/ 9621) 
 if I'm an unfit parent, not me. And that put a stop to that right away. 

Recording: (7316/ 9621) 
 We had, my husband and I had just some herbs, you know, parsley and chives and some basil, rosemary, that type of thing. 

Recording: (7317/ 9621) 
 Pretty good. He liked it a lot, but it was a big change from the Catholic school. Big change. He liked it a lot. I don't know if you're familiar with Fort Hayes. It's a college prep, I call it an alternative school. It's called Magnet School in most places. It's college prep with an emphasis on the arts and there's some career programs there. So it was good for him. 

Recording: (7318/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7319/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7320/ 9621) 
 Yeah, Laura Clintonville. 

Recording: (7321/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7322/ 9621) 
 in a fight and they just said that we want to be looked at as just other kids, you know, in high school. But yet when they wear makeup and they spike their hair and they have all these piercings, you know, it's like they don't want to be like everybody else. 

Recording: (7323/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right, and the amount of money that is spent is just, I just can't imagine. Millions and millions have been spent already, hundreds of millions, and it's just starting. 

Recording: (7324/ 9621) 
 care. 

Recording: (7325/ 9621) 
 not since the new year started we haven't been. I like scary I think he's into scary action you know like 

Recording: (7326/ 9621) 
 I have it. 

Recording: (7327/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7328/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I don't remember. 

Recording: (7329/ 9621) 
 I think he's done some positive things. That whole thing about as far as your student loans and being able to get into Scala has helped me. As far as some of the issues go, I think that I feel pretty similar to the way he does. Some of his foreign policy things I think have gone pretty decently. I I mean, I think, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if you really feel like that whole healthcare thing, which nothing ever happened with, really. And I think these people have a lot of really great ideas, but they don't ever really put anything into action. They just kind of skate along. And I don't know if there's anything substantial I can say, that was a wonderful thing that you did that I feel very affected by it. Economy's fine. I mean, so it's not that he's, I feel like he's doing a horrible job, but I don't really know how much he's actually doing. And I think that unfortunately, you spend a lot of your time trying to get out of personal issues that you've gotten yourself into and you can't really focus on anything that's positive that you want to do for the country. And I think it's just too bad because I feel like if I was president, not that I want to be president, but you'd have three or four things that you'd think were very important. You'd hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas, people that were very competent, that you'd feel like they'd actually be able to accomplish some things, and you'd really work to get some stuff done. And I don't know if it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question.

I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I think it's a great question. I mean there's so many different issues that people want to look at and you end up focusing on things like Philip Morris, you know, which is like the biggest thing in the whole world, you know, and there's so many other things that I think you could be looking at that are important. I just, I don't know, maybe, I mean I'm not real up on everything that's been done, but I guess it just kind of seems like I wish people would be a little bit more focused and you would be able to say, you know, there's these three things that I think are really important that I'm really going to work to make sure that they get taken care of. I just think people kind of la-dee-dah and say, well, it's like this, you know, we'll see what we can kind of do about it. 

Recording: (7330/ 9621) 
 Well, see, my husband would do that. It's so bizarre because I honestly don't. I think that's where his brain is completely lacking. I get to make all the decisions at my house about discipline and about what people can do and can't do. And we all understand this, and it's perfectly fine. And he says, I'm not a good judge of that. You'll have to check with, because my son was like 11. He let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends. I said, where are they? Oh, they said they were going down on campus. I said, on campus? How are my dead body? He's not allowed down there. 

Recording: (7331/ 9621) 
 I listen to someone, I just touch someone. We'll be successful. You'll be successful as an individual. And that's what's most critical. You yourself has to do it, not the business, because from you, businesses observe. 

Recording: (7332/ 9621) 
 and we know that the result could be death, then like, and it's an aggression thing. One side will be the aggressor, one would obviously, because you can't have two aggressive things, naturally one would be aggressive and then one would be aggressive in its response. You know what I mean? So in like a state of war, it was like that. So in that context, I think, but like in the same context, I feel it'd be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because they didn't decide to become a combatant. So if you're a combatant and you make that decision or you're drafted, which that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you were part of that society that got you drafted. So if you choose to be part of that society, I mean that's a little shadier, but still if you both make the desire to do it then. So if I were drafted I think I would fight, I'm sure I would fight for the contract, but I don't think I would go, I just don't feel the need to go on a rampage or anything. 

Recording: (7333/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (7334/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (7335/ 9621) 
 I don't know where it is, but I definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments and projects in the tunnel. 

Recording: (7336/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah it was. And it was very slow and you'd key in a few characters and send it and wait. Much different now. 

Recording: (7337/ 9621) 
 as far as being heterosexual. So I mean I really can't say that I'd see that affecting the kids. 

Recording: (7338/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7339/ 9621) 
 I know, I was thinking that before when you were telling me stuff. 

Recording: (7340/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7341/ 9621) 
 He was in so much trouble and that was the main reason why I didn't stay with him. He was just draining on me and pulling me down. He was never really there. He was in and out of jail all the time. I would go through the whole Bureau of Child Support, that whole thing. That was a total mess. He wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff. It turned out he could just move. 

Recording: (7342/ 9621) 
 You 

Recording: (7343/ 9621) 
 I always wish somebody would do a survey on that and say, back in 65 or whatever, what's the difference between what they're teaching them then and what they teach them now? Is it really that or is it just our imagination? Just don't remember enough. But it seems more to me. And computers really have helped it. 

Recording: (7344/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's right. Frank Sinatra is the one who was saying, I'll do it. I did it my way. And that's really, I think, the biggest problem in the world today. I want to do it my way. And you can't, or you've got to cooperate with the other person. 

Recording: (7345/ 9621) 
 You lose sight of that, I think. You know what I mean? And a lot of those guys become real egotistical. I mean, I like my uncle and everything, but... 

Recording: (7346/ 9621) 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, and you know, that song by itself, probably if I just heard it once or twice, it's okay. Yeah. And she's an interesting character, I guess. I mean, I don't know everything about her, but I remember that she insulted the Pope. Yeah. 

Recording: (7347/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7348/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (7349/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7350/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's why I would like him to get into Sunday school. I would like him to go to classes before Sunday, you know, prayer and all that. 

Recording: (7351/ 9621) 
 Me, I don't want to go to jail and get arrested because I feel I won't do my people any service by being in jail. 

Recording: (7352/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7353/ 9621) 
 I think if God meant me to, I think it's wrong for them to be using that introvertal fertilization, I think they call it. Introvertal, I can't even say the right thing. What is it? That's about right. 

Recording: (7354/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (7355/ 9621) 
 And I had a few serious relationships, but I just, I never felt they were the right one. 

Recording: (7356/ 9621) 
 Generally, it's in the summertime. That's the way it was when she was going to school. Now, you know, with her going to school like at St. Louis, I guess it would be that way. 

Recording: (7357/ 9621) 
 Nope. 

Recording: (7358/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (7359/ 9621) 
 If you have specific questions, we're never going to get to them. 

Recording: (7360/ 9621) 
 Well, sure. 

Recording: (7361/ 9621) 
 on that. 

Recording: (7362/ 9621) 
 So the money's just kind of wasted. 

Recording: (7363/ 9621) 
 It seems like it. Just about everywhere on that street is one way or another criminals 

Recording: (7364/ 9621) 
 shocking. 

Recording: (7365/ 9621) 
 Well, like, um, I knew one of my friends from Sunbury was, uh, because Kat does a lot of acting stuff and like, um, my one friend, uh, knew, knew her, like they did plays together, like down at, like, Columbus Junior Theater or something. And like, that's, so like, um, that's how we got introduced or whatever. And then we've just been friends for a while, a couple, a couple years. Yeah. 

Recording: (7366/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. 

Recording: (7367/ 9621) 
 Hania Douglas, Te Karere. 

Recording: (7368/ 9621) 
 I need a grocery list to find out what we need to buy. 

Recording: (7369/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she had an apartment in Arlington and so they wanted to get an actual house. 

Recording: (7370/ 9621) 
 I like cool police officers. 

Recording: (7371/ 9621) 
 Yeah, happy and you know, cup your hands. 

Recording: (7372/ 9621) 
 Normally I would say no, but yeah, I do just because let's face it I probably can't do it anyhow, and I would feel better for them, and if they used it because You know it's not good for the children that are born. It's not good for them I'd prefer abstinence, but let's be realistic. You know I think we're past that point now I know a lot of Christians argue, but you're wrong well Yeah, I might be wrong, but you know we can't go backwards on that. I don't think you can only work on your own 

Recording: (7373/ 9621) 
 So it's still just sitting down on my computer sits next to it. The only thing is you take it down, you can only have half a desk. 

Recording: (7374/ 9621) 
 doesn't seem right. 

Recording: (7375/ 9621) 
 Yeah, plus they have it which they've had for like 20 some years a comp fest or something which is big thing down there, you know local musicians and 

Recording: (7376/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I can't wait. 

Recording: (7377/ 9621) 
 And there's all kinds of things going on. I mean, if you had the money, you could do something every night. 

Recording: (7378/ 9621) 
 Maybe, because she says us Americans are different. 

Recording: (7379/ 9621) 
 They were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it. And pretty much all the other problems, well, there weren't really too many other problems. I mean, the economy's doing really well. Foreign relations are always shaky, but they're getting a little bit better. 

Recording: (7380/ 9621) 
 Bruges in Belgium. So I have a game going on with a good friend of mine named Michelle. I have this stupid ring here. You see the ring? So I have lost something like two incarnations of this ring. Just flat out lost them because, well, I'm an irresponsible cuss. And one of them, a third if you will, I gave to her. 

Recording: (7381/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7382/ 9621) 
 I like him personally, and when he was running for mayor, I would have voted for him. I met him and everything, but I guess he just plays the devil's advocate all the time at the school board meetings. I heard this is just a rumor. You want gossip in here? 

Recording: (7383/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7384/ 9621) 
 That's like 25 or 30 an hour. 

Recording: (7385/ 9621) 
 Is there the resentment to things like McDonald's? They are too, or is it? 

Recording: (7386/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (7387/ 9621) 
 I'm finishing high school. I actually heard about a program where you can finish college on the internet. 

Recording: (7388/ 9621) 
 and they have excellent. 

Recording: (7389/ 9621) 
 Well, it's like the... 

Recording: (7390/ 9621) 
 Kind of. 

Recording: (7391/ 9621) 
 And it was in the butt, don't get me wrong. He told me he was gonna have me locked up for child abuse. So I threw his ass in the car and took him downtown and took him inside and told him to tell them people because they're gonna lock him up. 

Recording: (7392/ 9621) 
 You know, kids, they have to learn these things on their own. I mean, he's 22. I still consider him a kid. But they have to learn these things on their own. You know, when you go to look for a pervert, what you need to look for and what you need to check out, you know, are you going to be able to afford it and everything that goes with it and have a work-study job, you know? 

Recording: (7393/ 9621) 
 I don't think so. I don't think they did. But there was this other guy my mom was talking about the other day. I don't know what she seen it on. I guess he did something like that. And he was just listing. They did an interview with him and told them how much things he did. Like he did this and that. And I guess he broke into bank once or something like that and got some accounts or something like that. I was like, whoa, yeah, that is. 

Recording: (7394/ 9621) 
 Pull out. 

Recording: (7395/ 9621) 
 media hype. 

Recording: (7396/ 9621) 
 aren't really saying much new, where if they have a more compact time, they could be. So I'd like to see them, see the time reduced. The conventions used to be interesting, because they debated the platforms. And that's all settled now. And it's just sort of this celebration type stuff. Well, that's not interesting. They could change and move the primaries, like to May. 

Recording: (7397/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7398/ 9621) 
 I was raised most of my life in Ashland. It's about ten minutes north of Mansfield, Ohio. We moved there from Mansfield, so I've been living in the Mansfield-Ashland area for 

Recording: (7399/ 9621) 
 I think, yeah, she will. 

Recording: (7400/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (7401/ 9621) 
 There was an in-depth story about that, I think it was Harper's Magazine or what, it was in a significant magazine where they had made a study of the New York situation. And I found that quite interesting and very, very impressive. As a matter of fact, whatever it was, I remember sending it in to the city council of Dayton, I just addressed it 

Recording: (7402/ 9621) 
 She's half naked and she should be a centerfold somewhere. And those are little kids, yeah, Disney movies, cartoons. I mean, when you look at that, you see it everywhere and it's really scary. But nobody's doing anything about it that I can see and they don't really see a concern. But like I said, wait till the generations start growing up. Wait till those little kids that we've put all those things in their head grows up. Then they'll think, wow, we should have done something. Well, I'm scared. I hope I don't live real long. It's scary. Well, and then the guy that, I don't even remember what his name was, he got a drunk driving charge. A judge. He was a judge. Now he's out. He went back to work on Monday. 

Recording: (7403/ 9621) 
 highly skilled or trained in that area. I mean you can't really do a simple sort of screening and these are good and these are bad. And again as I mentioned previously I think it's more to do with maybe being aware of the interaction of you know the different students with each other. And I mean if it was as bad as they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be. I mean, you're never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different cliques, but I can't help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would do something like that, that it had to have been more than just sort of normal jocks versus whatever. So I think it should be more, I don't know. I mean even, I went to a private Catholic high school, but even there, there was a sense of that. And I mean, some of the things that went on should definitely not have been going on. And that was only on a very small level. There were 86 people in my graduating class. And I mean, this is a high school with several hundred students that this happened at. 

Recording: (7404/ 9621) 
 Heh heh heh. 

Recording: (7405/ 9621) 
 You know, I said to myself, because I had postpartum depression with my third and fourth child, and I thought, what good am I going to be to these children if I'm not able to take care of them? So the decision was that after the fourth child, we would practice birth control. So, and I felt comfortable with that. 

Recording: (7406/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I usually am. Not quite there yet. Not really. 

Recording: (7407/ 9621) 
 No sunlight, you know, and they don't give him, they keep it warm and he's not allowed sheets or razors, you know, other than electric razors, so he can't kill himself. So you're just stuck. There's nothing you could do all day for 40 years or however until he naturally dies. And that to me would be, like that to me is actually like, that has to be worse. Like, just the agony and the, I think you'd have to go insane. Like, there's really so can... I'd ask for board games or something. But he doesn't even hear a human voice. Because I think it's something that was written in the scriptures. You're dead to the world is the worst that you can do. And so the world sees him, you know what I mean? So that'd be rough. That'd be real rough. And so obviously he would want to, like they say now, people that observe him, he sings to himself and he reads the Bible every day. But I don't know, that'd be strange. It'd be such a horrible thing to go through. I couldn't imagine being locked in a room for a few days. 

Recording: (7408/ 9621) 
 So 

Recording: (7409/ 9621) 
 16. 

Recording: (7410/ 9621) 
 A couple, three times too, but on the phone and everything. And then I sat there and said, well, you can call me every name in the book, do whatever the heck you want to, but I'm still your father. 

Recording: (7411/ 9621) 
 just one school. So that's how many there was. 

Recording: (7412/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7413/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7414/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7415/ 9621) 
 Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's very true. 

Recording: (7416/ 9621) 
 Let's watch 7 to 9. 

Recording: (7417/ 9621) 
 We well sort of and kind of yes, we were I mean we dated in high school But he ended up going to prom with somebody else so we I mean we went to move went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom and his mom or campfire leaders together in the whole bit and then we didn't really date in college Kind of really didn't get together at all freshman year He did go to school here And then as as I said I swam for Ohio State and then I went into Agler Davidson, a sporting goods store to buy a swimsuit my sophomore year and he was the cashier there. 

Recording: (7418/ 9621) 
 Eh. 

Recording: (7419/ 9621) 
 No. I'm not sending him to a Columbus public school, but an alternative school I will send him to. Private school, I don't. I would if I had the money to tell you the truth. I would, most definitely. But I know I couldn't afford it. That's why I've never thought about it, really. 

Recording: (7420/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7421/ 9621) 
 Yeah, stay away from salt, sodium, stuff like that. Pop, coffee, I don't have no problem there. I don't drink coffee. I drink a lot of pop, though. Like pork products. 

Recording: (7422/ 9621) 
 Wow, that's great. 

Recording: (7423/ 9621) 
 And a lot of times unions, they actually seem detrimental to production and to the actual individual needs of the members of the union. Because if a union becomes powerful, you can feel free to call off and things like that. And that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees a lazy union as a representative of these workers. So they're more apt to go outside. 

Recording: (7424/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that wouldn't work. 

Recording: (7425/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7426/ 9621) 
 I know, that's... 

Recording: (7427/ 9621) 
 BLEH 

Recording: (7428/ 9621) 
 But I don't think it's bad. 

Recording: (7429/ 9621) 
 So one day, it was a really bad day. I'd gone to Tulsa, Oklahoma with somebody and came back. And like I said, I hadn't had anything to eat the entire day. And it was like midnight, and I got home. And I thought, I'm too hungry. I'm too tired and hungry. And I just thought, I'm not making anything. So I just went to bed. And a guy knocked on my door, which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me. And he told me, are you in there? And I wouldn't answer. Well, it was a real cheap apartment. He took a credit card and punched the doorknob. 

Recording: (7430/ 9621) 
 Actually, I wore out. 

Recording: (7431/ 9621) 
 A lot of places have these little well-known hiding spots, you know, like, to try to keep them like a secret away from the tourists. 

Recording: (7432/ 9621) 
 gays, homosexuals and all those. 

Recording: (7433/ 9621) 
 A few times they did specifically say homosexuality, but there were other things that they'd cover. It's not like it was just an all out assault on being gay or anything like that. 

Recording: (7434/ 9621) 
 within her life. She does more with the children because most of them live here. Our children are all away. 

Recording: (7435/ 9621) 
 OK. 

Recording: (7436/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I mean, I think it's kind of ridiculous for kids to pay to chew gum, you know, or if they get caught chewing, like, de-sales. All my cousins went to de-sales. And if they got caught chewing gum, they had to pay. 

Recording: (7437/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well like, I mean high school has always been really easy and like high school was really easy, like I never really felt like challenged even remotely by anything. Like, I mean it's so like, high school was kind of like a joke, it was real fun and everything, you know, just to like not really have to do pretty much of anything, you know. And like, so college was a little bit different, I mean it was like a little bit more challenging. I mean it's basically the same thing in high school, you just have less time to do the material, you know? So it's just like, as opposed to having three weeks to doing a paper and doing it the night before, you have three days to do it, and you still do it the night before. It's just like, I don't know. I thought, I just kind of like found out like that I really don't like school and like I want to go back and like having to take math classes again. Like I just like, it isn't really my thing. Like when, too, my thing. I always knew that it would be like this. You always have to take basic classes. But I was a history major. And so it's like, I don't care about math at all. And anything that I would do would be humanities. So it's like, 

Recording: (7438/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. An all-white jury. 

Recording: (7439/ 9621) 
 WIPE VO 

Recording: (7440/ 9621) 
 And the questions aren't easy. I mean, I doubt if I could pass some of them. I mean, I probably could pass the citizenship and the English and maybe the science because I like science and I keep up on that stuff. But I doubt if I could pass the math because I don't teach math and I don't use math that much other than just normal, you know, add, subtract, multiply. 

Recording: (7441/ 9621) 
 I think they lost. I think Ohio State lost because they was just out there ranting and raving. And after a while, it got out of hand. 

Recording: (7442/ 9621) 
 Bad acoustics, really. 

Recording: (7443/ 9621) 
 It's different. 

Recording: (7444/ 9621) 
 I don't think we take up a huge amount. And then we get some of the service through Ornet as well, which is, I think it's just up Lane Avenue. They give us the domain name and all that. 

Recording: (7445/ 9621) 
 Like right now their biggest campaign is some elementary school I believe, no I think it's a high school, and Marion was built on an old weapons depot and so like leukemia has risen and so like that's their main campaign now is to inform the public and try and get that changed. They've also done other things, other, they do anything dealing with the environment, like exposure, things like that, so. 

Recording: (7446/ 9621) 
 over on an adjoining hill, oh about half a mile away I guess, and he was getting even for the day before. 

Recording: (7447/ 9621) 
 You alright? 

Recording: (7448/ 9621) 
 If it's not a necessity, I'll have to forfeit it right now. Well, a lot of them want the necessities, they also want some of the extras. And in order to do that, both have to work. Well, consequently, who's really raising the kids? If they're lucky, they've got a loving grandparent. 99 times out of 100, I don't know if that's a good statistic, it's the babysitters or, you know, these places. It's not a babysitter, it's a babysitter school or something like that. And that's not the same loving, cuddling atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids. And I think that that's one of the things they can change, plus the fact that they changed these stupid TV programs, because that's a terrible influence. A lot of kids, it's taking over their life. If it's not that now, it's worse yet. The kids are on the internet now. That's even worse, because now you can't even hear what they're getting into at least on TV You could walk in and sit and turn it off now. You can go in I guess and see what they're on the internet Honestly, no, sorry, you can't in the internet anymore But I think those are all really they can be good influences if they've got the right program and the right person are talking to but too many times It's the other way around 

Recording: (7449/ 9621) 
 Yes, exactly. 

Recording: (7450/ 9621) 
 I hate my, my last name is terrible. I hate my last name. 

Recording: (7451/ 9621) 
 well, muggings on the subway or stuff, you know, just in general. 

Recording: (7452/ 9621) 
 Just general things that I think you should take for granted. 

Recording: (7453/ 9621) 
 Relax, get a dead-end job that doesn't come home with me, try and pay off my debt and maybe make a little bit so... Grad school, yeah. But also enjoy all the things I didn't get to do. 

Recording: (7454/ 9621) 
 Aww. 

Recording: (7455/ 9621) 
 Well, and they had to cover their hair. I know all of that, but I don't think that's really been... 

Recording: (7456/ 9621) 
 or somebody or later they'll claim that I was coerced to saying that as I walked out the door. You know, and it's a big lie. 

Recording: (7457/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (7458/ 9621) 
 Well, I know people that sleep outside, and not all of them are veterans and everything, but there again, they don't want to be a part of the quote-unquote sheltered system, you know, staying in an open shelter, VOA or something like that. 

Recording: (7459/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (7460/ 9621) 
 And there's lighting effects like strobe lights, disco balls. 

Recording: (7461/ 9621) 
 Yeah, just since March. 

Recording: (7462/ 9621) 
 I went to for grade school and for high school. 

Recording: (7463/ 9621) 
 Or does this say this? You know, this is what I thought this said. Does that what that really says? Well, here's a perfect example. The other day, my kids, my sixth graders turned in papers on if I could be an animal, here's the animal I would be and here's why. And they had to research the animal. They had like a month to do it. And they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and whether they travel in groups or alone and what part of the world they mostly habitat, what they eat, all that. Okay, perfect example. One of my students wanted to say, my animal that I picked lives mostly on vegetables. And he couldn't figure out how to spell it, so he went into the computer and he asked it and it gave him the word vestibules. 

Recording: (7464/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7465/ 9621) 
 Oh man. 

Recording: (7466/ 9621) 
 So... 

Recording: (7467/ 9621) 
 then I 

Recording: (7468/ 9621) 
 existing area. I mean they could actually, well, yeah, they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something, feed them or something. 

Recording: (7469/ 9621) 
 light news. That's why I tend to read alternative newspapers and stuff, because you do get a different perspective. It's probably just slanted, but it is different. You're right. 

Recording: (7470/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7471/ 9621) 
 I think so because I... 

Recording: (7472/ 9621) 
 which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses and those types of things you can get some that are older that need a lot of work but that's a pretty high demand area. 

Recording: (7473/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7474/ 9621) 
 I'm 

Recording: (7475/ 9621) 
 Okay, that's why they did a lot of like biological studies is that barrier weave? Okay, I've heard of it. 

Recording: (7476/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7477/ 9621) 
 You had women working before, but self-discipline is a brick in our family. That's part of it. Self-discipline. Making things too easy for us. Oh, we can't do without it. You ever try to work for something? I mean, you really struggled to achieve something? Did it mean more to you than something that was given to you? Tell me. 

Recording: (7478/ 9621) 
 Well, I'll have a, maybe when I'm 100, I'll have that figured out. 

Recording: (7479/ 9621) 
 Then my sister lives in the middle of Nebraska. Nobody visits her. Nobody wants to go to Nebraska. What's out there? Come watch the corn grow. 

Recording: (7480/ 9621) 
 Because that is sort of what I found interesting there, too. I mean, there were a lot of jibes about that. I remember driving to Germany with a couple English friends to visit some German friends of theirs. And we got there, and we got lost in all these things. It took us way longer than it should have. And a friend of the person we were visiting said, oh, what, did you have to stop at every McDonald's along the way? And I was like, I'm a vegetarian. I don't even eat at McDonald's. And it was really mean. It's like, that isn't really a very good joke. And that kind of thing came up quite frequently. But I always said, McDonald's wouldn't survive here if no one ate there. And you can't tell me that everyone in there is American. 

Recording: (7481/ 9621) 
 Eh. 

Recording: (7482/ 9621) 
 Well, there's the whole thing about the police chief, and then there's the whole thing about the federal lawsuit against Columbus. 

Recording: (7483/ 9621) 
 And that's what we're concerned with. You need to interact more with people. We need to interact more with people every day of our life. That's where we learn from. We don't learn by giving things to people. Just like if you're a parent giving allowance, you don't give your kids money to do chores they normally expect them to do. But you give them something in addition to develop more responsibility. But we don't talk about responsibility in our society today. I dare you to say where in the heck they say publicly, this is our bill of responsibility. Do you know where there is? Do we talk about responsibilities now? 

Recording: (7484/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and it's not too bad because I had to scratch off your ticket you gave me. 

Recording: (7485/ 9621) 
 I just, well, I didn't understand as much as you probably do. I just was like clueless as to what I needed to do to become an art major. And I go to my advisor and they tell me what to take and it was the art advisor, but I didn't really think I had to do anything special. Like I didn't know about the portfolio review and all that stuff. And that was probably my own fault for not asking questions. But so it me a while, and then I just kind of went to Columbus State and went on a mission and came back. So I just got accepted into that college. But yeah. 

Recording: (7486/ 9621) 
 stuff like that and I think they might have found like one or two guns. So, and that to me was, but my high school is 2,000 people so I guess by sheer numbers one or two persons would bring a gun. 

Recording: (7487/ 9621) 
 I do. I am against religion in school. I just don't think they should push that on people. I don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything like that. But as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what's out there, most kids know what the wrong thing is. 

Recording: (7488/ 9621) 
 I'm on the computer at least six hours a day. 

Recording: (7489/ 9621) 
 That is surprising. 

Recording: (7490/ 9621) 
 Does that make sense? 

Recording: (7491/ 9621) 
 like just like um like communal showers and stuff and like um just how it's like one room that you like kind of live in or whatever you know it's more like like the army or something you know like real simple everything's real simple and everything's uniform and like i don't know 

Recording: (7492/ 9621) 
 And she just came here and lived with me a year ago so she could have her baby here. 

Recording: (7493/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7494/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7495/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think that's probably, you know, I'm not that familiar with it now, but I think that they are getting better and seeing the cracks and things like that that people fall through. 

Recording: (7496/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7497/ 9621) 
 Well, I get the sense that if there are discipline problems, it's so hard to get anything done to solve them, unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school. That's the big thing now. But it's just so hard to get anything done. And I think at that point, the teachers get frustrated because they don't see the support throughout through the administration. They have to wait until something's pretty egregious before it's dealt with. 

Recording: (7498/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7499/ 9621) 
 I would be a lot happier. 

Recording: (7500/ 9621) 
 I actually joined the church in, well, I don't know, six years ago, about six years ago. And they did a survey here at LSU, and they were just asking people if they thought that Christ had visited America, and there was a record of that account. Do I think that would be important? And I was like, well, I think so, yeah. But I was kind of hesitant. I mean, it took me a while. I read the Book of Mormon and I really prayed about it. It took me about six months. Then I finally decided that I really liked it and it was what I had been wanting. So that's how I decided. 

Recording: (7501/ 9621) 
 Right, because everything that has a coupon has tons of fat, tons of sugar, and is overpriced. 

Recording: (7502/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they, yeah, she moved in with him. 

Recording: (7503/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7504/ 9621) 
 Sorry. 

Recording: (7505/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7506/ 9621) 
 So indirectly, it was a very bad reason that I came here, but it worked out. 

Recording: (7507/ 9621) 
 blonde haired, blue eyed, overweight people. 

Recording: (7508/ 9621) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (7509/ 9621) 
 We continue Merrily On with My Day. 

Recording: (7510/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7511/ 9621) 
 Well, not really. They have a lot of religious beliefs on their own that they've held on to because they just have had nothing. 

Recording: (7512/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7513/ 9621) 
 I used to live up there too. 

Recording: (7514/ 9621) 
 Well, generally they have some area. I don't think I've ever met the kid yet, the special kid, who has no area that he doesn't excel in. Like once I had a sixth grade girl who still didn't know her timetables in sixth grade, but she had a Beverly Sills opera voice. And in every single school production, she was the lead singer. I had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level. It seems like when God takes away from you, he gives something back. I've had kids who've got every badge you can get in Boy Scouts. And, you know, I mean, there's usually something that they're really, it might not be related to school, but there's usually something that they're really, really good at in some other area, like swimming or scouting or whatever. So, you know, but generally speaking, they will attack a problem a totally different way than the norm and they will come up with much more creative solutions than a normal person with 100 or 95 IQ. Now, I've seen them long to know that, and worked with him long enough to know that, well I have one boy who can't spell them, he still spells it T-H-I-M, and he took my computer apart the other day and adjusted something in the motherboard and put it back together and now it works. 

Recording: (7515/ 9621) 
 He traced freight whatever that means. 

Recording: (7516/ 9621) 
 and feeder, and I go, don't bother me, I've had a bad day and I'm tired, you go watch TV. And how are we raising children doing that? And people say, you have to have both those incomes because we have to do this. Why do you have to have a house that's $300,000? Why do you have to have a brand new car? Isn't life sacrifices? Aren't you supposed to do best for your children? My children don't have everything. They don't have a Sega. My daughter has a car that goes to, and it's 12 years old. And I made her buy it. I told her, I says, I will not buy you a car. I said, if you want a car, you have to buy it. And I said, when it's time for maintenance, you have to pay for it. Because she has to be responsible for things. And she appreciates that. I admire her. She's the person I never was at that age. I don't take full responsibility for that. 

Recording: (7517/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7518/ 9621) 
 No offense. 

Recording: (7519/ 9621) 
 It really is. 

Recording: (7520/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7521/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (7522/ 9621) 
 But. 

Recording: (7523/ 9621) 
 I'm going to get done with this, I swear. 

Recording: (7524/ 9621) 
 with There's just a lot there that, you know, women go through that purification every month. So women really don't need the sweat line, but it's there for them and they do participate. 

Recording: (7525/ 9621) 
 But it just depends upon, it still comes back to who you're now. 

Recording: (7526/ 9621) 
 And we were staying at his grandpa's, and his grandpa would sit on the back porch and say all kinds of racial slurs towards black people. 

Recording: (7527/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7528/ 9621) 
 Yes and no. They're kind of weird. One set of grandparents really I can't hear ever says anything. They said on the other side that they are a little bit more racist. But at the same time, I don't know, they almost set up like a double standard for black people. There are black people that they really like, and I mean, they're actually friends with some black people, and there are black people that they don't like for whatever the reason may be. And those are the people that they're racist towards. I mean, it's the same thing that goes with white people Obviously there are white people that you can stand there are white people that are just obnoxious and you don't want to deal with I mean, it's basically the same thing Yeah Yeah Yeah, exactly in their heart of hearts, you know. They're just, they're friends with these people because they like them. They don't see the fact that they're gay. They don't care. Actually, if you ask them, they'll have gay people. That's really funny. What about relations between the sexes? Do you think that we live in a sexist society? Do you think see guys still being more Like the decision-making type and as being like the final say in things rather than women and I would see them Having an authority figure that's being a woman is causing problems to them 

Recording: (7529/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, it's real well-known. 

Recording: (7530/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7531/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7532/ 9621) 
 The only thing that was really down there before I moved out was the Lincoln-Levesque Tower, the shortest one. But of course, the university is just about the same in some ways, the stadium and all that. 

Recording: (7533/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, we all get together. We have to get a shelter house now somewhere because nobody's house is big enough. Well, and then we have so many little kids that it's great because we just go to a shelter inside and they have it for Christmas and things like that. They can run around, the kids run around. 

Recording: (7534/ 9621) 
 Oh my. 

Recording: (7535/ 9621) 
 Right now. 

Recording: (7536/ 9621) 
 oh yeah yes i what religion are you all that one has all those me this game rules that work out in real life christianity yeah 

Recording: (7537/ 9621) 
 break. 

Recording: (7538/ 9621) 
 Oh, what are you doing that for? 

Recording: (7539/ 9621) 
 Um, not really because I think, you know, if, if they're going to, they're going to, and I don't think a lot of them at that stage are going to go out of their way to go and buy them. So I don't think it's like, Oh, I have a condom. I'm going to have sex. I mean, actually, this is a very hot topic in England right now because they've got the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the world. And I mean, there are stories everywhere about 12-year-olds having babies. And I mean, there, they've gone to distributing condoms on playgrounds, which I do think is a little bit too much. I think maybe having them available in the nurse's office is one thing. They're there, they can go in and get some or something, but I think actually physically passing them out is a bad idea. But demonstrating and that kind of thing I think is pretty important just because of the simple fact of the statistics that they are doing it. So at the very least, they might as well be safe about it. 

Recording: (7540/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7541/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she still lives with family. 

Recording: (7542/ 9621) 
 Because then, you know, what if something major happens that fourth time, then what? But I think, at least for children especially, because they have no means to help themselves. And like, the parents obviously, even if they're working, a lot of times can't get health care for their children. So I think, at least for children, because how many accidents happen to children? Like, people are always breaking arms and stuff. 

Recording: (7543/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7544/ 9621) 
 I don't know anything about the Starbuck. Oh man, don't let the shirt fool you. 

Recording: (7545/ 9621) 
 I think they're retired teachers or people on maybe the board at different school districts or I don't know. 

Recording: (7546/ 9621) 
 Sure! 

Recording: (7547/ 9621) 
 you problems you and I are going to be the laughingstock of the corporate America and you really think you and I want to do that so to me nobody's gonna have a problem because years they're gonna go remember bank one you know you go get ten bucks and you get 500 out of the machine duh you know it's like who wants to do business with nobody's gonna do that you know maybe some little company um that really doesn't you know have a big impact but I don't see where anything's gonna happen at all you know 

Recording: (7548/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7549/ 9621) 
 But she likes the spirituality of the community over there. 

Recording: (7550/ 9621) 
 If it doesn't affect them, it's not there. And if they don't have to... 

Recording: (7551/ 9621) 
 They don't get, I don't think they get federal funding. I think they get a little bit from the Ohio Arts Council and they raise money from the businesses in the community. Plus, we charge for tickets for people to come and see us. And sometimes we get a lot, sometimes we don't get so many. Turns out the concerts we get the most, the biggest audience for are the Christmas concerts where we have the children's choir. 

Recording: (7552/ 9621) 
 No, I'm not really up on the coaching thing. I mean, anybody can coach a game. It takes players to play the game. 

Recording: (7553/ 9621) 
 He wants to, yeah. 

Recording: (7554/ 9621) 
 I think they've got more money. I don't know if that necessarily makes them a better school. I think a lot of it is really what you, as far as a parent, is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it. You know, my family, my brothers and sisters, they all went to public schools and they took advanced AP classes and they worked real hard. And they've got, I think that they have options. 

Recording: (7555/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7556/ 9621) 
 Okay, well a few years ago there was this big fuss, you know, we've got to close some schools. Enrollment's dropping, it's just the way the population goes. Enrollment's dropping, we can't afford to keep them all going, so let's close. And they did this big study and they targeted some to close. Well, there was a big uproar from the people whose kids went to that school. Like there will be whenever you close the school. So the board backed down and changed its mind. The next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools. But there wasn't the money for it, so there was a big fuss about that. Then two years later they came out with another study that says, well, they need to refurbish some schools, close a couple, and then knock some down and rebuild them. And it's like every two years it's a different direction. And it's like they're almost afraid to take a stand that somebody's not going to like. Well, if you're going to shut a school down, somebody's going to be really ticked off. 

Recording: (7557/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I've run into that a lot. I think part of it was the high school I went to. I mean, I've gone to Catholic schools all my life or whatever. And obviously I've run into a lot more of the wealthier type people who either just don't have time or don't have the interest and just pay people to do it. 

Recording: (7558/ 9621) 
 It's like, sometimes I think about people, you know, they call, and especially when I talk to, sometimes people call in and I talk, you know, I get the same people or whatever, every once in a while, especially if like there's people that have real specific weird names or something that I can remember, they'll call back and I'll think about them. It's like how I have this, you know, it's like we have this weird like five minute relationship or something like that, like every couple of weeks or something. And it's like, to think about what their life is like and what they are actually like and you know it's like so weird it's like I don't know yeah everybody 

Recording: (7559/ 9621) 
 At the beginning he did perfectly, but now he's doing this, I want up at four o'clock kind of thing and give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep. I don't want to walk all the way downstairs to make a bottle for him at four o'clock. I can't see, filling my way through the hallways and stuff. 

Recording: (7560/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7561/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (7562/ 9621) 
 Right. And it's sometimes that opens the person up because a child they're so innocent and you can't help but love them. And I know my mom had a big problem with the whole interracial 

Recording: (7563/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (7564/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7565/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he was. He's going to always be real. I like that he's got his... yeah. 

Recording: (7566/ 9621) 
 Actually, I went back to, I came back to Ohio State in, let's see, 93 through 95 and got a teaching certificate in science for secondary science. And I taught for a year at a small school in Lancaster, a Catholic high school down there. Left there. Part of it was my fault. I wasn't very good at discipline in the classroom. So that was probably one of the biggest problems I had. 

Recording: (7567/ 9621) 
 Yeah, just had to leave me here. We've been best friends for so many years. 

Recording: (7568/ 9621) 
 No, that's interesting though, because I think that my whole, I mean, I always still, I still feel like I'm just. 

Recording: (7569/ 9621) 
 Well, I was in management for about 13, 14 years, and it wasn't bad where I was before. This management was, it was the whole department. It was, I don't know what it was. People, they were always arguing and fighting. It was just the whole atmosphere of that place, and it was just, people that I'd known for years and gotten along well with were just, they were different when they went in there. They just changed. It was just, it was just not a good place to work. 

Recording: (7570/ 9621) 
 Now that doesn't make any extra work for the teacher, but it gives him a shot. He usually will answer the concepts. He'll usually answer the main stuff that he knows, and if you only grade him on that, he might have a shot at a C or a B. I mean, there's all kind of ways to modify, give a reduced work amount, give a kid a copy of another student's notes if his are crummy and he can't study from them. We even have a thing at our school that looks just like notebook paper and it's got three holes in the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk, but it's NCR. You know, the two copies of the 

Recording: (7571/ 9621) 
 I mean we throw the book away on some of these other guys, I mean we throw the cue away on some of these guys and you know we want to set them as an example and you know this one guy had one DUI two years ago so he's got to be in jail for five years. Then this judge, I mean he's got probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol and he's still a judge. Monday morning he goes to work. 

Recording: (7572/ 9621) 
 It's in the accounting department. 

Recording: (7573/ 9621) 
 You know, it happened like in the same year, 88, you know. But it was pretty tough, but I just didn't deal with it properly, you know. I should've went and got counseling. Well, I probably should've got marriage counseling, but I refused to do that, too. So I didn't think I had a problem with it. She was a wonderful woman. 

Recording: (7574/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7575/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7576/ 9621) 
 I went to the, they got a food one over here by the vet clinic. 

Recording: (7577/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (7578/ 9621) 
 Okay 

Recording: (7579/ 9621) 
 I know, I don't... 

Recording: (7580/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (7581/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like, it's killing its own citizens. It's so ridiculous. 

Recording: (7582/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7583/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7584/ 9621) 
 No big deal. 

Recording: (7585/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she might know her name. She's on the school board now. 

Recording: (7586/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7587/ 9621) 
 Or you're just gonna go back because you don't know any other way at the time. 

Recording: (7588/ 9621) 
 Yeah, told me to exercise, which I do. Told me to quit smoking, which I've been trying, no offense. It's harder to quit. 

Recording: (7589/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7590/ 9621) 
 I heard like I'd never been there but I heard like New York don't even don't even ask a stranger because they won't even talk to you they won't look at you you know like on New York City 

Recording: (7591/ 9621) 
 And not that that changed my opinion of her, but back then, and nobody would talk about it. And I just think in today's world, we need to bring subjects like that out, knowing, because there's so many people who are ashamed about things. And they shouldn't be ashamed, because it's a lifestyle anymore. It needs to be brought up more. 

Recording: (7592/ 9621) 
 hahahaha 

Recording: (7593/ 9621) 
 The pizza's really cheap. 

Recording: (7594/ 9621) 
 Well, we use. 

Recording: (7595/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's how it works. 

Recording: (7596/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my brother-in-law was very much opposed to any kind of gun control. The whole family was hunters and things like that. My father-in-law was a hunter, but he was not opposed to gun control either, as long as he could hunt. 

Recording: (7597/ 9621) 
 It was a real tight job market for librarians. 

Recording: (7598/ 9621) 
 I don't know, I think you just kind of deal with it when it gets here, though. 

Recording: (7599/ 9621) 
 I was there for almost a month. Did one of those tours where you get on the bus and did the London and the France and the Italy and the Holland. 

Recording: (7600/ 9621) 
 Yes, I do. I have a brother and two sisters. 

Recording: (7601/ 9621) 
 My favorite character on that show had always been Chakotay. And I don't like how his character has been portrayed in the recent couple of seasons. I like the fact that he was someone who had been a Starfleet officer, but because of a matter of principle, left Starfleet, joined the Maquis, but was still fundamentally an honorable person. And had to deal with being welcomed back into the fold of Starfleet by being first officer on the ship, but still had to balance his new life. I saw so much potential for interesting stuff with it. But I feel that he's become just another character to deliver lines for most of the episodes that I've seen from this past season. I stopped 

Recording: (7602/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (7603/ 9621) 
 It was just, yeah, I guess the mafia was a big problem. They just take over everything and they don't pay their workers and most people aren't mafia so they don't get paid. 

Recording: (7604/ 9621) 
 you know, for me, getting out of bed is a victory. You know, for the longest time I was so depressed, you know, but the animals, you know, yeah, using the animals for therapy, animal therapy, I mean dogs in particular, cats, but you know, there's some animals that aren't to be pets. They're wild animals. I saw a show last week on Fox that was called When Good Pets Go Bad Too. 

Recording: (7605/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7606/ 9621) 
 She's in my class. 

Recording: (7607/ 9621) 
 Um 

Recording: (7608/ 9621) 
 they are identical, then the black woman should get the job. But there is no, to me, the most qualified person should get the job, end of story. That's it. It's best for society in general. 

Recording: (7609/ 9621) 
 an urban area. 

Recording: (7610/ 9621) 
 Most of the trouble I have, I got one neighbor that hates me and he's a sharer. 

Recording: (7611/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they are worried about you. and then it just taken off and what were they not even a half an hour or whatever out in the ocean were out over the ocean and all wants to play went woman 30 seconds or something I mean it was down from what was it 30,000 feet or something so well they must have they'd had to been dead before they reached the water because of that sudden decline more that make you pass out if nothing else would and there now they're trying to decide was it sabotage was there something wrong with the plane was it pallet air and so I don't know if there's going to be more sabotage stuff going on. The way some of those countries fight over there and the other countries and try to get us involved, I don't know. I hope not. I pray to God to something. Then all the good people are trying to say, no, God's going to come back and salvage the world. You know, all the good people will be here and probably the bad people, maybe he'll take the good people and make it a better world for us and the rest of them will suddenly die. I don't know. 

Recording: (7612/ 9621) 
 What instrument do you play? 

Recording: (7613/ 9621) 
 which consists of Art 162 through Art 260. 

Recording: (7614/ 9621) 
 Maybe I'll move to Australia. 

Recording: (7615/ 9621) 
 They had all that white sand and that water you could see down for miles. 

Recording: (7616/ 9621) 
 And we met, I was working at a restaurant in Short North, and they were having a Christmas party and his brother worked there. And he brought my husband and I went there and that's how we met. 

Recording: (7617/ 9621) 
 but yet they want to lay off people that actually need the jobs. 

Recording: (7618/ 9621) 
 He ended up dying. He ended up dying from what's that disease? AIDS. AIDS, thank you. From the AIDS virus that's going around. When he was near dying, what did he tell his mother? And I won't use the exact words because it was profanity. And he said, I really, my life, didn't I, mom? And he's got three kids, three growing kids right now. So you see, what made him change? What influenced in society to do that? I don't know how we find it, but I think if more people got... I don't think it was ever taught in the Bible to do that, was it? I really don't think so. And I don't ever, you know, hear it. I'm not that well versed when it comes to the Bible. But I do believe there's a God, and I do believe in prayer, and I do believe in guardian angels angels watching over you and I don't think you have to go to church to really believe all this because it's how you treat the other person that really counts and if I treat that person basically it boils down to treat the other person the way you would like to be treated 

Recording: (7619/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I remember political correctness. 

Recording: (7620/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it sucked. 

Recording: (7621/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7622/ 9621) 
 I used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor, and I used to go to work at 8 o'clock in the morning and get home for my first meal with Johnny Carson. I did this six days a week. To get my one day off, I would get up at 7 o'clock, get in my car and drive to the mall, and park and sleep in my car. 

Recording: (7623/ 9621) 
 There was one where they were going along and there's a little scroungy looking dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after him. Joe, I'm glad that I finally see somebody I can be sorry for. He's worse off than I am. 

Recording: (7624/ 9621) 
 I really... 

Recording: (7625/ 9621) 
 I really think civil rights have gone too far. Because for every rule that says you cannot do this to the other person, there's another rule that says that's okay if that other person does it to you. I mean, my mother used to say for every law that was written, there's another law written over here that will actually nullify that one. And actually as I've grown older, I found it's worse in today's world. As I said, as the civil rights move rights move it and you have a right to this and you have a right to that. It's terrible. Murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain. That plea bargain I think is the most thing that ever was passed. I don't think there should be any plea bargains. And then there are people who get murdered and sent to electric chair. Electric chair? I still believe in it. Because if someone is proven, and I don't believe that they should have ten years of what do they call that legal process where they can bring appeals, thank you, that's it. I don't think that you should have that. Either one appeal or two should be the limit. If they're still found guilty, sorry. And if an innocent person hasn't been able to prove he's innocent, that's just one of those freaky things that happens. Because sometimes innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that's guilty that's corrupt enough in his mind that he knows how to get away with it and get somebody else to take his blame. But I don't think there's that many innocent people that ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have nullified that. Because what right does that person have to live? TV just about two or three days ago and here's this guy down the south end and as he's walked out handcuffed behind him and they're putting him to cruiser. Well I did do exactly what I said I was gonna do. I was gonna watch her draw her last breath. He killed her. Now he's gonna go and probably maybe a plea bargain and he'll get off with it because maybe he was abused as a child and that had something to do with the way he was thinking. What happened to this woman because of it? I'm sorry. Let him pay the penalty. And if more people paid the penalty there would be more people thinking twice, three, four times before they did the same thing and that would help I think to stop some of that. 

Recording: (7626/ 9621) 
 That's exactly what it is. 

Recording: (7627/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't know that that's a cause. They as a group, this was kind of a happenstance. This occurred as a result of a very major world war. So in terms of them causing it, it was a happenstance and part of this mass communication we're talking about began with them. And yes, they are a major influence because we're talking about numbers and you're talking about greater intercommunication. I'd like to go back one step where we're talking about when I made mention that three doors down, you don't even know who that individual is, and I wanna stick with that. I think that's profound. As an individual communication, we are nearing zero in terms of global mass communication to everybody with interpersonal communications. That's the key in my opinion. Personal versus interpersonal communications. And it's zero over here and we're almost 100% over here. But when we're in this interpersonal or global or massive, whichever term is the most appropriate, John Doe who speaks here, he hasn't the faintest idea who Jane Doe is over here on the personal It used to be that yeah, you knew who this person was over here That's Jane Doe that lives in that third house and she married Henry Jackson. Don't you remember old Henry? Well Henry was a guy live way over there and the other side of town Mass communications as it is today, I haven't the faintest idea where Jane came from or where Henry Jackson or where old whoever he was lived over there I said. So I think I think you need to distinguish between the personal interpersonal relationship. So maybe I die crash too far there. Or who the next door neighbor is. 

Recording: (7628/ 9621) 
 I see I'm gonna have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say I I would really like to see this to happen But I also know that it motion. It'll never happen within the next three or four generations But I I'm of a guy who still believes that the lady has a place in her home. And I do not believe that we need a man and wife out working and making incomes as everyone in the United States today feels they must. Hazel hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about need versus luxuries. I want, I want, I want. Well, my judgment is that we're spending today probably 80% of the income on things that they want and only 20% on what they need. And that's all they need to spend on that need so therefore the pardon 

Recording: (7629/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm opposed to parental consent. But I don't have kids, so that opinion doesn't mean as much as it might from someone who did. 

Recording: (7630/ 9621) 
 I hadn't heard that. Some of it when Clinton is backed down, I think I sort of summarized what I just said is, for the health insurance and reform of all that health insurance, he backed down but it wasn't going to happen. So he could keep the furor going for months and months or years and still nothing was going to happen. It was the wrong time. Or we try to move on to something else. I think it's regrettable it hasn't come back. Like you said, it's like, well, we made the one attempt and it didn't go anywhere, so let's let it drop. It's a count for somebody else to pick it up. Well, Clinton's a lame duck. Why can't he bring it back? 

Recording: (7631/ 9621) 
 I don't think so. 

Recording: (7632/ 9621) 
 Yeah, just having fun. 

Recording: (7633/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (7634/ 9621) 
 I don't think it ever really occurred to me. 

Recording: (7635/ 9621) 
 In first grade, his teacher knew that he needed that, but the principal would not allow her to do it. And that's one reason we put him in a different school for second grade. 

Recording: (7636/ 9621) 
 Oh! 

Recording: (7637/ 9621) 
 And then in a little bit, there's another one the other side of us. 

Recording: (7638/ 9621) 
 What happened was we know one of the people on our committee teaches in the math department here. 

Recording: (7639/ 9621) 
 you know, when she's in her middle years and Tamara when she's, you know. But, you know, I finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing. It's the one thing in life we get to do where there's no restrictions, no laws, nobody gives you any limitations or parameters. They just say go for it and people just go nuts with it. 

Recording: (7640/ 9621) 
 They don't have nothing like that nowadays. Somebody fall through the ice and they'd sue them. 

Recording: (7641/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she does. She comes back a lot. 

Recording: (7642/ 9621) 
 In fact, he—let's see, I don't remember, but I suppose that they had a draft when he was about 21. 

Recording: (7643/ 9621) 
 I like looking at the stories from a different perspective as a kid. 

Recording: (7644/ 9621) 
 That's because their parents are rich. 

Recording: (7645/ 9621) 
 A little less romantic. 

Recording: (7646/ 9621) 
 And the thing that was always cool about my mom is if it was somebody that wasn't real nice to me or that I didn't really like, she wouldn't have anything to do with them. I mean, the whole thing was, you know, if I approved of this person, 

Recording: (7647/ 9621) 
 I heard, I know my aunt works at JCPenney's. I know JCPenney's and Lazarus are both moving their existing stores to Polaris. 

Recording: (7648/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7649/ 9621) 
 Yes, where did he get, I don't know, he's outside somewhere. 

Recording: (7650/ 9621) 
 Like 99 East Road or something like that. 

Recording: (7651/ 9621) 
 And I'm. 

Recording: (7652/ 9621) 
 Not so much. For 15 years I lived down on which is more a lot of artists live there. But I'm amazed that my new street is full of artists too. 

Recording: (7653/ 9621) 
 if you just said take or get, I just, I say well, I'm just going to, because when you get out in the work world, there's going to be two things they care about about your writing. Is it usable and is it persuasive? Because usually when you're writing something in the workplace, it's either to explain something or it's to persuade somebody to do something. So if it's not those two things, it's not writing that's going to make it in the world. 

Recording: (7654/ 9621) 
 you know, society again is taking away everything from you. 

Recording: (7655/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, I did. 

Recording: (7656/ 9621) 
 That's where you need to correct. You can't just say, hey, we got a schnook out here we can screw him. That's a problem. And you're saying, does it take home? Does it take church? It takes morals. And that's why I was telling you before, we got away from morals in our society. We could care less about you. I always say a good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother. I mean, sell his own mother on the market. 

Recording: (7657/ 9621) 
 Beer bottles, sure do. 

Recording: (7658/ 9621) 
 Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, besides our time's probably up. I don't know. 

Recording: (7659/ 9621) 
 Since 74. Yeah. 

Recording: (7660/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, they've had two different articles in there about it. Well, they had a big article back when, who was it, Jesse Jackson was down there or something, a couple years ago or something. And he made a concerted effort to try to let people know how much poverty was down there and everything. But then you go to a lot of other extremes, you know, where you sit there and these people wouldn't want to live in Columbus. So, you know, you could give them a million dollar house up here and an income for the rest of their life. They don't want that. They want to live down where they feel comfortable with. 

Recording: (7661/ 9621) 
 Maybe at the underlying base. 

Recording: (7662/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (7663/ 9621) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (7664/ 9621) 
 Mhmm. 

Recording: (7665/ 9621) 
 break. 

Recording: (7666/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (7667/ 9621) 
 Who cares? So people just think there's really no point to even vote. It's too bad. It really is. 

Recording: (7668/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7669/ 9621) 
 We met at Ohio State. Everything revolves around Ohio State. When I first started working here, I was working as an orderly in the operating room for 10 years, and she worked in the intensive care unit. I've only been in the maintenance area for maybe 10 years also. I don't know. It just didn't seem like it was heading anywhere, and I wanted to start doing something that was more career oriented now I do HVAC for 22 buildings in the Northeast area do a lot of chillers and laser labs and chilled water for Different kinds of experiments they're doing in the chemistry departments and stuff like that. I went to school through our technical school to get a degree in the HVAC stuff. Oh yeah, I like it. Every day is different. You have different problems every day. I like working with tools and fixing stuff, so that's come in handy. 

Recording: (7670/ 9621) 
 and everyone would be all right with that. 

Recording: (7671/ 9621) 
 at I think it was Mount Carmel we went over the weekend. And we went there Saturday morning and I've got this 45 minute ultrasound tape of the baby, which is cute because you can only see parts of it, but you can really, you can see its face. You can see what it looks like and everything. But I said, I don't want to know the sex. And it's so hard to, because we're looking, of course we're going through this tape, trying to see if we can see anything. And you just can't, you just can't tell. I think she was real careful to make sure that, that we wouldn't be able to. She says, I know what it is, but I said, alright, well don't tell us. So that was kind of neat. 

Recording: (7672/ 9621) 
 I went to a lot of them. Middle school I went to Clinton and Indianola. High school I went to Brookhaven and Fort Hayes. 

Recording: (7673/ 9621) 
 Right, right. It's not an analytical process. It's analytical in the sense of controlling your mouth and your hand and the bell and that kind of thing to get what you want to come out. But it's not analytical in terms of finger combinations. No, not so much. 

Recording: (7674/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7675/ 9621) 
 period because they're from a different, they're from the Virgin Islands. 

Recording: (7676/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7677/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I applied for it and went after it aggressively. 

Recording: (7678/ 9621) 
 It's very hard. I mean I missed a lot of school. I mean most people would think that I have a lot of help but I really don't. I mean I live with my parents and everything and I mean they have jobs too. It's not like 

Recording: (7679/ 9621) 
 Oh my god. 

Recording: (7680/ 9621) 
 That's good. 

Recording: (7681/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I like that. 

Recording: (7682/ 9621) 
 child care. 

Recording: (7683/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7684/ 9621) 
 What we should buy. Yeah, the retail. What we should buy. And that's the problem. We listen to business too much. If business reemphasized their goals to help society out and not themselves. 

Recording: (7685/ 9621) 
 You know, anything probably? No? You know, so. 

Recording: (7686/ 9621) 
 It'll be a long campaign. I thought it was interesting that Gore suggested two debates a week, and I just can't imagine watching two debates a week for months. At least they could get things out into the open. They had the chance, but who wants to watch that much? Who has the time to watch that much? 

Recording: (7687/ 9621) 
 Yep. 

Recording: (7688/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah, in a case like that, the parents should know because there's something going on. 

Recording: (7689/ 9621) 
 And they collect the cards. 

Recording: (7690/ 9621) 
 People would knock on the door and they would yell that they weren't home or something. 

Recording: (7691/ 9621) 
 See now. 

Recording: (7692/ 9621) 
 Emma's sort of a timeless name in that it's, you know, been around for a long time, yet people don't associate it with old women because there are still Emmas today.

 So we focus on computers, but we do camping and he teaches us a lot of business ethic and 

Recording: (7695/ 9621) 
 Both. Today I was farmed out to bank 1. Yesterday was Monday. I was farmed out to bank 1. Friday, farmed out to bank 1. But now I've resolved all those three issues and they don't have anything else to throw at me interesting, so I'm leaving. Tomorrow I'll be back at the home office working on some other stuff that will benefit us in franchising, because franchising is a much better way to make money than selling time for out for money. Selling time for money sucks. 

Recording: (7696/ 9621) 
 Thank you. 

Recording: (7697/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (7698/ 9621) 
 I used to work at Baker, believe me on that. 

Recording: (7699/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (7700/ 9621) 
 and to see what else happens. I mean, from what I know, this story was kind of happy and in many ways a children's story. But what has to happen within the larger story between now and the end of episode three is the Republic falls and the Empire takes over and all the Jedi are killed by this cute little eight-year-old kid. 

Recording: (7701/ 9621) 
 My oldest son was in Vietnam. 

Recording: (7702/ 9621) 
 I'm originally from Indiana, but I lived up in Amherst, Ohio. I lived there for about four years, and then I, because I worked at a place called Cleveland Center, which is an air route traffic control center, and I moved from there to Ohio State Airport, and I worked there for 19 years, and then I transferred to Port Columbus. 

Recording: (7703/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we was going up there to... I can't really remember. It's been 20 years ago. And I just don't have any real recollection. 

Recording: (7704/ 9621) 
 I love it when people come from out of town because then I get to try new places and I'm way behind. I need more company. 

Recording: (7705/ 9621) 
 to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice. But then here comes Cooper's wife and his daughter and like his son and I'm thinking, they're putting all his family up in this hotel the night before a game? I mean, I don't know. I just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when none of those boys get to bring anybody, you know what I mean? 

Recording: (7706/ 9621) 
 You know, before they tell you this was last summer and it was on a vacation to Myrtle Beach, they're telling you about the surfboard that they got and how great they surfed, when that really should come down in the body of the paper. You know, most people just, they assume the reader knows, I always say to my kids, pretend like you're writing for an alien. 

Recording: (7707/ 9621) 
 Well my son he worked on the Coleman campaign. So of course you know I had to get out and you know help put the signs out and all that kind of stuff. I got the bumper sticker. Got some people in my family some bumper stickers some neighbors. 

Recording: (7708/ 9621) 
 And you know, I'd show up at their house if I thought something was going on. You know, it don't matter to me. I'm just, like I said, I grew up here in Columbus, Ohio. I'm just a dumb hillbilly. You know? Like, if they were having a party at somebody's house and their parents didn't know, I'd show up there and ask them what the hell was going on. 

Recording: (7709/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, a lot of people really, that I knew anyway, didn't know about Ecstasy until they saw that movie and then it was the whole talk of high school, whatever. 

Recording: (7710/ 9621) 
 I am not agreeing with. My grandma, she seems to think, okay, maybe, but if you put a discount store in there, I would love it. That's what she said. I was like, okay. 

Recording: (7711/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I would say so. 

Recording: (7712/ 9621) 
 Yeah, there was a lot of positive things from it as far as discipline, as far as growing up faster and everything. Sometimes when I see more like my daughter or like other people that age and everything, they tend to act grown up, where I felt like I was forced to grow up. 

Recording: (7713/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (7714/ 9621) 
 kept I want the cars. We don't talk about buying cars nowadays. We talk about leasing cars. And pretty soon we're not going to be buying houses. We'll be leasing houses from the finance companies. We won't be owning the land. The finance company owns it. You don't own it. You're leasing it. And that's our quality of life. And when we go to third world countries, we say, I don't know how they can stand living here. And yet, you know what? They probably have better quality of understanding one another than we do. Because I feel like the more you get closer to one another, the further you become apart. 

Recording: (7715/ 9621) 
 And then I have a daughter in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I have a daughter in Reston, Virginia. So they did, they're all married. Well, three are married, yeah. 

Recording: (7716/ 9621) 
 and it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job anyhow. Just kind of one of those, okay, let's do it. 

Recording: (7717/ 9621) 
 She's got like a third grade education. She's like a kid herself. 

Recording: (7718/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I haven't, I really haven't even, haven't even given it that much thought yet. 

Recording: (7719/ 9621) 
 Or they didn't say loud enough that you had the right to. Well, I was never told I had the right. I never was told I could make the phone call. And if they can convince them, and the poor policeman can, I think really what they ought to start doing is taping everything that's said and taping it so it's so clear that there's no way that they can deny it. And then yet they've got that thing loud. It's illegal, civil rights. You can't tape what I'm saying. It's like, can we paper for you then get them to get them to sign when they go in there you fully understand now what we are going to do and If boy if they say then they really make it so and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even well, then how could they say that they They've got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalty stick 

Recording: (7720/ 9621) 
 which we encourage that. 

Recording: (7721/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7722/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7723/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7724/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7725/ 9621) 
 He cleans the toilet too, because he's a boy and boys, even some men, don't quite 

Recording: (7726/ 9621) 
 Starting over means putting a new operating system on it. 

Recording: (7727/ 9621) 
 you're really smart. No, you're not dumb. But they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things and that they can't do. And so then they say, well, my parents are just saying that because they love me. I'm really stupid. You know, and you have to actually show them when they get to be this age that, look, you have 117 IQ. 

Recording: (7728/ 9621) 
 I'm 

Recording: (7729/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha. 

Recording: (7730/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (7731/ 9621) 
 price is so high. 

Recording: (7732/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7733/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7734/ 9621) 
 so they couldn't go in that direction. They'd have to just bring in new people, which I think probably wouldn't be a good idea. 

Recording: (7735/ 9621) 
 Correct. 

Recording: (7736/ 9621) 
 Well, I think it's true. You don't vote because you think, I don't want either one of these people. What does it matter? 

Recording: (7737/ 9621) 
 I don't know where he lives now, but yeah. I've seen him live before. 

Recording: (7738/ 9621) 
 Yeah! 

Recording: (7739/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7740/ 9621) 
 I don't allow no hitting, no, you know. And she kind of lets it get away. She lets him be a little rough because he's a boy, but I don't. 

Recording: (7741/ 9621) 
 Right, it's bad, it's bad. On the other hand, it's not good to let your mind wander off somewhere. I find myself having to focus sometimes. I mean, to really, mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7742/ 9621) 
 Uh huh, uh huh. 

Recording: (7743/ 9621) 
 And they'll ignore them, won't they? Because they're in their good Sunday clothes. 

Recording: (7744/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7745/ 9621) 
 And how many dollars does a consumer put into research as opposed to the business? That's the inequity in our life. And you're basically putting a shaft to the consumer. 

Recording: (7746/ 9621) 
 They say, oh no, we don't want, all right, say let's get a foreign exchange student. This would be fun. 

Recording: (7747/ 9621) 
 Yeah, when you have that many animals, you know, people. 

Recording: (7748/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (7749/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7750/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7751/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you're not alone. 

Recording: (7752/ 9621) 
 It's over off of 33, 270 and 33. 

Recording: (7753/ 9621) 
 I'm always lived in Ohio, so I'm a native Ohioan. Southern Ohio. Right now I'm staying at home with my two boys. I have a one year old and a five year old. Where do you believe in breastfeeding from birth to whenever and holding, you know, like carrying the baby in a sling with you and just being available for the baby's needs and just... No, not really. I feel a huge difference for me personally just in the closeness and being able to pick up on his cues a lot better and just knowing his needs 

Recording: (7754/ 9621) 
 I believe them. I do. It's a very personal thing and if that's what they saw. Most of my patients are head traumas so they can come up with some pretty wild stories but those visions are usually pretty clear. 

Recording: (7755/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7756/ 9621) 
 No, it'd probably be something with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind. 

Recording: (7757/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7758/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7759/ 9621) 
 There's not a lot around, you know. And we were on the list forever. We were on the list five years before we had our first kids. Yeah, and they call them. Well, you still want to be on the list? Yeah, we don't have any children, but keep us on the list, you know. And it's like you say, and there's 300 or 400 kids in that daycare. It's a large daycare. But there's not a lot out there that's good quality. I mean, it's scary. And then you see in the news, they were abusing the kids, you know, and you don't want to go to work feeling that you're worrying about your kids and we've never really felt like that. And we kind of work a little different shifts, my wife and I, so our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she doesn't start till 930 and I pick them up at four. 

Recording: (7760/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7761/ 9621) 
 I was real negative. She's real negative about things and tries to put me down for being positive. I always see a way out of something and she doesn't. I think she gets kind of mad. Plus she feels like she's old at 50. I said, oh my gosh, you don't even have any bad habits. I said, you could live to be 100. That's 50 more years. If you look at it that way, 50 is not old at all to me. I mean, that's just, as much as you learn, you know, you can't trade that. But yeah, my one sister that's exactly seven years older than me, we're the closest. And then the sister that's two years older than me, she's the same way. She does a lot of things that I'm like, why are you doing that? You know, don't do that do that. So she pretty much stays low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through. 

Recording: (7762/ 9621) 
 Yeah, she had a talk and my sister and I attended and I don't like the problem I think with universal health care would be everyone don't you think like everyone with a little scratch would go in you know as opposed to Like the very and I think that could drive costs up so there has to be a way to balance I'm not sure how you would go about doing that Because you don't want to put a limit and say okay. You can only go three times a year 

Recording: (7763/ 9621) 
 read the paper, and have the TV off. There's something I think I might want to, I might be interested in. So I just do all those things and do my machine. 

Recording: (7764/ 9621) 
 I don't know. I think, I really don't know. I think in today's world, what they call the 90s, that it's just like everything has changed. Like when I grew up, we kids that grew up, when we grew up and everything else, we had standards and there were certain things we did or didn't do. And then it came along that when our kids grew up, then there were so many things that changed. One thing that stands out and this has nothing to do with politics but it's an example. In school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics. I couldn't even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and I took geometry and algebra. You'd think, I used to use straight A's in algebra. When I got to geometry I thought why am I taking this? That wasn't so good but still the way they were teaching it now and they're teaching it entirely different now and I think Linda explained to how they were doing with Matthew and said she couldn't even help him and so you know it's in the same way politics it people I guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their whatever changes and I think it is, to me it's getting worse, but then my mother used to say the same thing about our generation. So I think it's just a sign of the times. I don't know what it is. 

Recording: (7765/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7766/ 9621) 
 all the way over to 11th Avenue. Man, that was a hot day too. 

Recording: (7767/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7768/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (7769/ 9621) 
 and the cops on the other side of Chris and now Chris is just near me, trying to be near me. He has no idea what the hell is going on. And this sinks in too. And I was like, you don't, did they tell you anything? He said, I have no idea what's going on. And I couldn't do anything about it. I couldn't tell him. I couldn't communicate. I was totally incapable. 

Recording: (7770/ 9621) 
 Stay on it. 

Recording: (7771/ 9621) 
 And it just sort of sparked an interest in me, I guess. And it just grew from there. 

Recording: (7772/ 9621) 
 that you really can get a lot out of it if that's something you want to do. And I think as long as you're involved with the school. 

Recording: (7773/ 9621) 
 They are good. 

Recording: (7774/ 9621) 
 Well, quarterback's got an injury to his hand. I mean, he still does good. He just needs to focus in on who he's throwing at instead of throwing it 50 miles down the road. He's done that a couple times yesterday. And watching out who he's throwing to might help, too. 

Recording: (7775/ 9621) 
 I know.

 Cuff is Catholics United for the Faith. She had graduated from Miami University of Ohio and got affiliated with Campus Crusade for Christ and so forth and went out to DeKalb and worked for Northern Illinois. Then went back working for the inner city area of Chicago and found herself that she liked Steubenville better. And when I relocated her, people would say, you're crazy, young lady. You're 25 and you're moving to Steubenville? They're migrating out of here. 

Recording: (7777/ 9621) 
 But by my brother being in there, being over there and everything, he was pretty upset that I did that. I just remember I had been plunked out of school. And he said, Dad, enlist in something. Don't go in a damn army. 

Recording: (7778/ 9621) 
 yeah right can't take it with you or something

 Of course, the multiple choice, there's a right or wrong answer.

 Now I was in the Marines. But basically all we did was just go back and forth from like Philippines to Vietnam, then from Vietnam to Hong Kong, from Hong Kong to Vietnam.

 For example, one of the issues that they were in the forefront on was justice for the people in Central and Latin America. 

Recording: (7784/ 9621) 
 Well, they pretty much put by the test scores, they don't sit you down like in private schools they do this. They sit you down one to one, just like we are. And they spend probably, you know, maybe 20, 30 minutes a day actually getting to know the student, what the student still needs for the completion of that grade. And once they figure that you're able to go there, then up you go, right up the ladder. 

Recording: (7785/ 9621) 
 They're about two hours west of Omaha. So it's different for them. 

Recording: (7786/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7787/ 9621) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (7788/ 9621) 
 No, they they divorced when I was like 10 or something so. I would say yes and no. I feel pretty accepted. 

Recording: (7789/ 9621) 
 This is my senior year. I'm graduating in June.

 Well, there's the whole theory that it has to drop back at some point, but I don't see it happening any time in the near future. 

Recording: (7791/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7792/ 9621) 
 I mean...

Recording: (7800/ 9621) 
 I just didn't see where it would be utilized here. 

Recording: (7801/ 9621) 
 All I remember is them talking about condoms. I don't think they talked about anything besides that. But then again, I could be remembering wrong. But yes, it is the stance. But I think in the schools, that's sort of like the hard line of the Catholic Church. But in the more progressive schools, they're a little bit more realistic. I mean this wasn't, I mean it was the Catholic school, but we didn't have nuns or anything there. I mean, you know, I think they were sort of more concerned with, you know, actually it might have been later than the first sex education we had that young. I mean it might have been more like a couple, like eighth grade that they talked about condoms. I doubt that they would have done that that early now that I think about it. But I know that there was at one point you know some sort of 

Recording: (7802/ 9621) 
 That movie was good. Makes you think. Like right now I'm cold. When you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. Like coldness.

 He hasn't questioned me like that, but I see a lot of things coming out. He's doing more in line. He's been doing things a lot more differently than my daughter, because my daughter was away at school, and he's with us every day. He stays home and doesn't want to stay on campus. He does things voluntarily. We don't have to coach him. He's working with a lot of other people. What he's been reared with reared with coached with and so forth. It's somewhat embedded He sees that and matter of fact some of the girls is dating They see that in him. I think it's a quality they they said she and I Give them thanks because I said hey, you know, it's rough out there because and the guys he runs out with, good quality guys, wow, they're an ornery, sure, but I wouldn't trade his friends for anything, gosh, I don't know how I came up with them, myself.

 Okay.

 warriors that are out there men and women that will do that more power to them. All I can do is pray about it and that's what I suggest to everybody else. That's the most powerful thing that you can do. Even one of the nuns in high school that taught me had a poster on the wall that said more things are wrought in this world by prayer than we'll ever know. 

Recording: (7813/ 9621) 
 It is, yeah. 

Recording: (7814/ 9621) 
 They will all care.

 Mm-hmm. Yeah, this was three years ago about three years ago in August. It'll be three and Yeah, it was however many was that in 89 or 90 or something like that. Well, it's it gets more and more Like it's not like America but more and more like a regular democracy every year I mean not really but it's closer and closer a little bit

 London, Paris, Prague, Budapest, Amsterdam, Venice, Vienna, Berlin, Munich. There's probably some more on there, but that's all the ones that jump off. There's like a little hit list in my head, obviously, and another hit list in my Palm Pilot, and life is good. 

Recording: (7821/ 9621) 
 and I just told them what it has to do with my belief system, so you're in violation of the First Amendment. And then they realized that I wasn't stupid, so they just made things more and more difficult for me. So I just decided to, since they weren't gonna change, I was just gonna leave. So it's a hard way to choose to walk. If you're an idealistic person, I mean, just more so me, to It's also very easy to get sucked into the attitude, well I'm going to change this. You know, if you can, you do what you can do as a human being. That alone is good enough.

 I've been there twice already.

Recording: (7824/ 9621) 
 Well, we didn't even have computers. 

Recording: (7825/ 9621) 
 I don't know what it's like to grow up anywhere else. I know what it's like. Kind of like where my cousin lived in New York because I'd go there in the summers. But. Did I like growing up in Columbus. How do you judge that you know what do you compare that to. 

Recording: (7826/ 9621) 
 Mostly accounting and things like that, such as accounts receivable for nursing homes and things like that. Pretty in-depth. Some of the day by, you know, if I just go for a day, it's filing and whatnot, getting phones. But most of the jobs actually, you learn a lot, so. 

Recording: (7827/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7828/ 9621) 
 161 was like, you know, all new. And this is the place I want to live, you know.

 But even though you're not responsible, I'm the one that's supposed to be responsible. The people that have the beer party in the house, yeah, they should be held responsible to some degree, but we're in a society that loves to sue people. 

Recording: (7833/ 9621) 
 Well, I always look back and look at this. There were how many thousands, maybe millions of years before Christ. And here we are 2,000 years after Christ. What makes us think we aren't going to live those 10, 15, 20, 50,000 years beyond? I can't believe, unless there's some thing like us, our planet colliding with another planet or something that would destroy everything. 

Recording: (7834/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7835/ 9621) 
 You know, these apartments where he's living in is just, God, I mean, it seems like 100 years old. 

Recording: (7836/ 9621) 
 they won't take proper advantage of it because they have their parents to look up to who didn't take advantage of it. 

Recording: (7837/ 9621) 
 Well, I think. 

Recording: (7838/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm.

 Yeah. Yeah.

 Yeah, he uses a lot of different slurs towards gay people.

Recording: (7847/ 9621) 
 get paid every week for doing nothing. 

Recording: (7848/ 9621) 
 Because, heck, it's Sydney. It's like a tourist place. 

Recording: (7849/ 9621) 
 and his report card, he's got like a 1.25 average. So they take Jelena who has an A, him who has a D, and they go, well, gee, the average kid in this school is like C plus, and they're stupid at this school. Columbus public schools don't do any good. Then you go to Dublin, Worthington, and Westerville. In order to get there, you're not gonna be in his condition, and you're not gonna be stupid because you're trying to, you know, probably both husband and wife work, so the intelligence is there, and you're not going to have dumb people living and going to those schools because it's very expensive to live in that area. So there's a natural prejudice that Columbus is stupid and worthy to Dublin, and it's really not true. It's just that, you know, you can't tell all the poor people and the people who don't have two parents don't come to school because we want our scores higher But you know when the news media goes look how bad Brown school did this year, but they don't look to see like Jelena They don't go well look at the scores on the California achievement test There's like 75% of the kids that are getting like, you know 90s and above but 25% are getting F's and D's and 

Recording: (7850/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, I know so many people who, when they get pregnant, are so conscientious about what they eat. And I mean, they won't take antihistamines in hay fever season. And so many things that they won't do, and they're so conscientious about it. It's hard for me. I mean, I just don't know anybody who smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that. On the other hand, I think it's a choice. And I mean, you want to try to help them, you want to make them aware of health issues, but I mean, a lot of women are not getting prenatal care either, and that's part of it. And you can't arrest them for that, you just got to get them to the doctor. 

Recording: (7851/ 9621) 
 And so you keep thinking, well, you know, they need more. But I was hoping they could use that land for something else. I don't know. There's, you know, there's so many, not building, but, you know, something maybe, especially in Dublin. But it's probably will be good for Columbus. 

Recording: (7852/ 9621) 
 See? 

Recording: (7853/ 9621) 
 Right? 

Recording: (7854/ 9621) 
 much more widely used once you get into college. But I mean as far as like the pot and just things like that I mean I can't say I see any difference between 

Recording: (7855/ 9621) 
 yeah that was all woods and everything back then nobody wanted to live up in there it was a trash area 

Recording: (7856/ 9621) 
 And the lower you are, apparently, the easier it is or something. That was the coach's philosophy anyway. 

Recording: (7857/ 9621) 
 Now I haven't been over there since then. 

Recording: (7858/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7859/ 9621) 
 It was, and I mean you get so hot and you're in a fever. 

Recording: (7860/ 9621) 
 The objectives in Vietnam were never clearly delineated. 

Recording: (7861/ 9621) 
 I don't know what kind that is because I know they've traded airplanes since I've been gone. 

Recording: (7862/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (7863/ 9621) 
 Also too, when's the last time you've seen a baseball game? Kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood. 

Recording: (7864/ 9621) 
 Right. Anybody with that bush. 

Recording: (7865/ 9621) 
 I said, there's a big. 

Recording: (7866/ 9621) 
 If you work at a college or a hospital, you make no money. Yeah, pretty much. It seems like it. I wanted to for a long time. Now I'm just not so sure that I want the two or three more years of school. They suggest two to three years for your PhD. I don't want to do that. 

Recording: (7867/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7868/ 9621) 
 I Just had a healthy vigorous conversation last night with a township trustee Jersey Township, which is just over in Licking County and This gentleman is 83 or 4 years of age and he's been a township trustee various times throughout his life and He is very very concerned because of the exploding Pot and hit boy should be back up. He's a farmer has been a farmer all of his life He owns about a hundred and fifty acres adjacent to approximately a thousand which his son is predominantly operating yet He goes out and works to help out at eight at this age. But he is concerned because they've just recently passed an ordinance within the county which allows developers to come in and already they are ready to take over a couple of farms that are fairly close to him but but it affects the whole township. And one of the things that they left out, as he put it, one of the ordinances that he pushed and pushed and pushed, he wanted a specific part of that ordinance to say, every so many people that move into this area, you must provide for a school. And he said, of consequence, and he said they didn't do it. He said, I push and push, and he said, all the influence was on the side to get more houses, get more houses because it was gonna produce more taxes, but they kept saying, well, what do you want these taxes for if you're not gonna provide for schools? So he was very concerned about that. So So here was a case in my opinion, a very, very honest politician, but he was also being shoved away from what he felt was an honest approach. 

Recording: (7869/ 9621) 
 well clown cone isn't there anymore. Clown cone you could get like a bag of tootsie rolls and pay only five cents so that's gone and that was a kid thing. My grandfather used to own NMM market 

Recording: (7870/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7871/ 9621) 
 Yeah, the medical school has pretty much limited them to 10% of the 

Recording: (7872/ 9621) 
 Do your thing. 

Recording: (7873/ 9621) 
 I do think there's some. And I don't think they'd probably get exposed to the different walks of life. I don't think they'd probably be exposed to the gay lesbian. I think that would probably just be blown over. And they didn't go very much in depth about sex. And your sex ed classes were pretty... But on the other hand, for me, that was fine. I don't know. Our friends that have an 11-year-old that's going to going to public school I mean he had a parenting class already where he had to carry around this baby he went we went to a hockey game with him and here he is with this baby at this hockey game and it was just like at 11 

Recording: (7874/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he went to Columbus Public Schools. Well, you know, I'm Catholic, and I went to Catholic schools. And so I tried that with both my kids, Catholic schools, for a couple years. And so he was in a Catholic school a couple years. But he got expelled because he's ADHD. 

Recording: (7875/ 9621) 
 See now, she's... 

Recording: (7876/ 9621) 
 Oh, that was the Monica Lewinsky. 

Recording: (7877/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7878/ 9621) 
 You 

Recording: (7879/ 9621) 
 There was other things. Right, yeah. Like we had our service. We'd clean up neighborhoods. Yeah, there was a lot of different things. 

Recording: (7880/ 9621) 
 So she's doing that. 

Recording: (7881/ 9621) 
 So I can sleep in. 

Recording: (7882/ 9621) 
 It all gets, I don't know, it all works itself out. Every other day you start him on taxes and he'll just start fuming. 

Recording: (7883/ 9621) 
 I don't actually think that I could call myself an engineer amongst engineers, but I think if I was calling myself an engineer or a psychologist, it would be okay. 

Recording: (7884/ 9621) 
 I didn't like his last middle name. 

Recording: (7885/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (7886/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (7887/ 9621) 
 like it's everything pretty I mean like basic stuff that you it would be it like you know like a Lazarus or something like that you know or a bunch of places you know like electronics appliances 

Recording: (7888/ 9621) 
 I've done it for the last five years. 

Recording: (7889/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that could really bite you in the back though, winning all that money. I'd be quite content with $1 million, but $10 million is kind of like an overkill. I mean, do you think anybody in this town has $10 million? Well, maybe a couple of people. Yeah. 

Recording: (7890/ 9621) 
 like why she pitched you know be happy for the indians unlike i'm happy for that's fine 

Recording: (7891/ 9621) 
 But having done it before, you know, and knowing where I went wrong, you know, that wouldn't happen again. So I've been off that shit for a while. But again, that was back in the... Actually, it was in the 90s, early 90s, but, you know, I was been doing it when we were... It was a recreation type of thing, you know, not as a Daily, you know Somebody come knocking on the door. Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah Yeah, stupid But I'd like to do something like that then I wouldn't mind having Some kind of place for you know, you see a lot of Different down-and-out type people and everything and really nobody really trying to help them or nothing, you know, I'd like to think that Maybe even this thing, you know could be like a sanctuary for me to come in and get some peace of mind or something Mm-hmm 

Recording: (7892/ 9621) 
 Do you think there are things that can be aware of it. And you can put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts. And they've got stairs up and down, and they get in their lockers and they bend over. And that's just too much. I mean, I think that's the first thing that has to be done. Take away that. That shouldn't even be a thought. And it's distracting enough for the guys their own age. But then you put these young teachers in there, maybe they're single guys that just had a hell of a time in college and then they get around all these girls and oh my gosh. Well you know you got to look at that. You got to be more aware. 

Recording: (7893/ 9621) 
 sad stories. Let's see. I don't know. That's basically who I am. 

Recording: (7894/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7895/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (7896/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7897/ 9621) 
 She doesn't so much mind anymore, I mean, since I've turned 18. I mean, ever since then it's been no problem or anything. I mean, she's sort of let me have my own opinion. 

Recording: (7898/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7899/ 9621) 
 Right. Personally I think it's a good idea. I mean I. I mean to me you know. It seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support you know and that. But. I come from a completely different background and everything else and education than than most of probably the people that this would concern. But I do think, I don't know, I mean, with the birth control that is available and all the options that there are. Sometimes I find it hard to be sympathetic for these people who just have so many children that they can't feed, they can't take care of. I mean, it's not like it was way back when when there was nothing and you were just stuck this way. I mean, a woman can, you know, protect herself if, you know, the man isn't willing to do it or whatever. So, and adoption and all the other things. 

Recording: (7900/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7901/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (7902/ 9621) 
 right 

Recording: (7903/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (7904/ 9621) 
 Control problems Of course, there's always a leak somewhere Yeah, well it could be hot water They send out heating hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant But about now they drain that it's drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff So they might of the door and going back. I this, what they were going for. And the majority of the people in the skilled trades aren't real big participators in the union, you know, we just ride along. And from what I've seen over the 20 years I've been here is it seemed that a lot of the union, what they did was keep the troublemaker employees around longer, you know. And so we've really now got a lot of the union what they did was was keep the troublemaker employees around longer, you know, and So we've really never had a lot of use for the union But recently we just figured out that you know if they decide to strike we have no choice too and you can't work because they will take all the money you make crossing that line, so You cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they'll take them to court and yeah, it's against take 

Recording: (7905/ 9621) 
 Um, they like me, but then they don't like me. 

Recording: (7906/ 9621) 
 It's a good place. They even stopped playing the ghetto music. They have this jukebox and it was horrible. They played the same three songs with horribly offensive lyrics and no melody whatsoever. 

Recording: (7907/ 9621) 
 I don't think so. 

Recording: (7908/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (7909/ 9621) 
 I wish I would. These guys going to military school and so forth, you know they've had problems before somewhere along the line, whether it's academics or social. Are you ready to take on this additional responsibility? No, but we don't promote it. Again, we get a separate rule. We have academics for the university. Oh, you're going to be a sport athlete? Oh, then we got a different standard here. I'm sure they do. They have different standards for a student athlete as opposed to what your standards were coming into college. I'm presuming you were not an athlete. 

Recording: (7910/ 9621) 
 There might be. 

Recording: (7911/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7912/ 9621) 
 I'm just kidding. 

Recording: (7913/ 9621) 
 And now it's Vegas. 

Recording: (7914/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7915/ 9621) 
 Which is, well, yeah, you know, could have done that too. 

Recording: (7916/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7917/ 9621) 
 Wonderful restaurants. 

Recording: (7918/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7919/ 9621) 
 I've never heard of it being developed commercially. 

Recording: (7920/ 9621) 
 And God only knows, he'd get a half a dozen drinks in him, then he'd go around the house, testing, testing, say a few words for a pot. And we used to say, get him out of here, you know? 

Recording: (7921/ 9621) 
 Yeah, just in their corporate offices. And that would be fun. So eventually I'll have my own radio station. If they interviewed me and knew that, they'd be like, quick, get that girl out of here. No, but that's like the most exciting thing right now is that. I mean, that looks real promising. And if I do that, then I'm going to have to do something voluntary or some voluntary work or choices. I looked at that too. That's Choices for Domestic Violence. That's an organization that I think would be really interesting and help me feel like, you know, helping people. They give new direction for abused wives and mothers and help them get on their feet, you know, give them the access to the different organizations that are out there. Basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they're abused the husbands are like, you know, a nightmare out there. So things like that. 

Recording: (7922/ 9621) 
 I had my head was that far below the surface. 

Recording: (7923/ 9621) 
 Right, right. It probably went out of business when he left. 

Recording: (7924/ 9621) 
 That's cool. 

Recording: (7925/ 9621) 
 So she would have been going to Northland High School, which is up here, just up where I'm living, 161 Cleveland area. So it would have been interesting. But then the other side of it, women tend to have the more emotional type of feelings than men you know we carried on our shoulders, you know so I Just hope see just 

Recording: (7926/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7927/ 9621) 
 Well, we were in Vancouver, so it's not that far away. We didn't hear about it for a couple of days, but I heard that that's all that was on. Every aspect of his life, every aspect of the search. Do people really need to know that? Do they need to have a driven home? And I think at that point, that's where the media, they're sensationalizing it. 

Recording: (7928/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (7929/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7930/ 9621) 
 Who do you think wants to keep you from doing something that will help you? Because people that's laying in indigenous tribes all over the world, they don't follow the Bible. They've done pretty damn good. 

Recording: (7931/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you just find it. I can do anything I want. Yeah. 

Recording: (7932/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7933/ 9621) 
 She said that it's like, I don't know, some people work there. I couldn't imagine working complete nights, you know? I mean, I like working 2-3, 2-11. I think I'd rather work like, maybe like noon to 8. That'd be better, because then it's like, I mean, I'm more toned to staying up late anyways, because of like, how it is or whatever. But like, I don't want to have to get up really early either. Like, I could never imagine having a 9 to 5 job. Like, that'd be horrible. 

Recording: (7934/ 9621) 
 That I don't know, but you know it's like if if you and I are running an airline and everybody wants to get New York at 8 a.m. And you go at 8 and I go to 830 who are they gonna fly on? 

Recording: (7935/ 9621) 
 It was just, yeah, talking about me and I would hear it from, it was just really childish. 

Recording: (7936/ 9621) 
 He saw, he's seen my oldest son when he was like two. I was at my cousin's wedding. My cousin invited me to his wedding and me and my son went. That was before me and my husband got married. That's another long story. He was three when we got married. And my dad threw a fit. 

Recording: (7937/ 9621) 
 I certainly spent most of my time in the areas that I grew up. 

Recording: (7938/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7939/ 9621) 
 I would find that hard to believe. 

Recording: (7940/ 9621) 
 That's alright. 

Recording: (7941/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7942/ 9621) 
 Now is when I need to be off with them, where we can take them out and run. 

Recording: (7943/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and he's got control over that because I mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman that Babysits and she would did very very well. She did all that stuff that I would like to be done She took him to the library She had nap time at a certain time there and you know lay down and it's just totally different at the grandmothers 

Recording: (7944/ 9621) 
 I mean, we would like, when he was 14 years old, we wouldn't let him go out and take a walk at 3 in the morning, and he couldn't understand that. I'm sorry. I don't think that's being a bad parent to tell you no. 

Recording: (7945/ 9621) 
 to let her out and that's kind of like I mean of course a kid you can't put in a yard. 

Recording: (7946/ 9621) 
 Oh, no. No, they move you around all the time. When you teach kids with learning disabilities, they move you to where the population is rather than move the kids to you. So yeah, I've been in Columbus and Worthington are the two systems I've been in. But in those systems, they can move you around from school to school. I'm in the same one now for this is my seventh year at the middle school. 

Recording: (7947/ 9621) 
 That's cool. 

Recording: (7948/ 9621) 
 I'm sure that it has because it enables a lot more people to get housing and things like that. And you know, growth is always good. My husband's in construction, so I shouldn't be against it or anything. But you kind of like to have things spread out and kind of, you know, have some space. 

Recording: (7949/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (7950/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7951/ 9621) 
 like i don't know how it is in canada i think yes it'd be bigger you know like uh... civic center something like that and i think that's really weird but that's like to be but uh... is kinda is it's interesting here is used to do it uh... sometimes at warehouses or like auditoriums or stuff and it's just like dance music and lights and stuff it's real fun 

Recording: (7952/ 9621) 
 ADHD and they do this, they were trying to make it to where he would calm down and they wouldn't have to give him so much medicine. And she reads a lot of magazines and articles about you know that problem and I guess he had, if you change their diet, if you take out milk or something I think it was. Did you know Twizzlers had milk in them? 

Recording: (7953/ 9621) 
 I love kittens, but I'm going to wait. 

Recording: (7954/ 9621) 
 I'm here. 

Recording: (7955/ 9621) 
 It's like your 18-month-old daughter, you have to amuse them and distract them. 

Recording: (7956/ 9621) 
 I don't know what you mean. 

Recording: (7957/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7958/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (7959/ 9621) 
 And like just through the first three hours, I mean you don't really start to feel it and then you really do. That little pain that I did feel, my mom's like, oh try doing it the whole time, you know. 

Recording: (7960/ 9621) 
 he described in there. 

Recording: (7961/ 9621) 
 and although that's trans meridian we go write that down because i don't know that name you know so 

Recording: (7962/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7963/ 9621) 
 Do you guys like shoot them? Have like kangaroo season? 

Recording: (7964/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7965/ 9621) 
 To me, the cholesterol level and the health from that food has got to be so bad. My only downfall is I love Taco Bell. So when I'm working out in the yard, and mowing, and edging, and trimming, and wash the car, and I look at my watch and I go, oh hell, I deserve a break. I'm going out to lunch. Well, most people would go somewhere really expensive. I go, I want a Mexican pizza and a Coke. So that's my big treat. But I am not a big fan of eating out either. We do like to go to Chinese restaurants. When I go, we have something nice. We're not cheap. We do go to movies every once in a while, but we do get a lot from the library because they're free. 

Recording: (7966/ 9621) 
 But it's such a good idea. Did I go to Ohio State? Yes. Yes. I told you that earlier though, but it wasn't being recorded then, so it's okay. 

Recording: (7967/ 9621) 
 I did have a white kid my son live in there and that's about it 

Recording: (7968/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (7969/ 9621) 
 And I don't know, Commons I didn't miss. Bus service I kind of missed because Aaron's car is out on West Campus. But I went home and got my dad's APAS. He teaches in the dental school, but he only teaches on Fridays. So he has that APAS available all the time. So our car is parked right next to the building. 

Recording: (7970/ 9621) 
 and they have to become an active learner and they have to be taught how to participate. 

Recording: (7971/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (7972/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (7973/ 9621) 
 They were the majority, huh? 

Recording: (7974/ 9621) 
 and was a wannabe writer. I mean, her mother was. She wrote quite a number of poems and paid to have them published in a small booklet. And some of them were real good and some of them... And my wife wrote some poetry too. She'd be down there typing and she'd, she always had these spiral notebooks and she'd stop and get an idea for a poem, maybe from something she was working on, I don't know what, but anyway, she wrote quite a few poems, some of them real good poetry, I thought. Most of them of more or less a religious nature and moral nature. In fact, the desk that she had, we finished off part of her basement. She had her office down there. And her desk is still down there. And one of the typewriters that she used, but it's, I don't know, it's been disused for too long, I guess, because I've tried to type on it. It doesn't shift like it should and so on. But anyway, she had, I don't know, how many of these spiral notebooks around and she'd just write in them. And since she passed away in 1979, I have run across, well, I just, I finally decided, well, those notebooks are down there and if I need one for something, I'll just go ahead and use it. And I've run across a couple of her poems that I didn't know anything about. 

Recording: (7975/ 9621) 
 There'd been a small raised place out there. And what I remember about it is one morning, Dad went out to milk and the milk cows were out on that island. 

Recording: (7976/ 9621) 
 I got one buddy that meets all the criteria there and everything and I see him quite a bit on the street and everything, you know, and he just He begs me to take him and get him help and everything, but you know, I keep saying, you know You're the one that's got to help yourself, man. You know, you got to give it up the war's over, you know. And he's like 53, and I see him down here every now and then, you know, so, but, you know, he just drinks all the time to try to ease the pain, and the pain really should have been done and gone by as much as he drank in his life, you know. So, I think there's a lot of people that can use that as an excuse, you know. 

Recording: (7977/ 9621) 
 27. I'll be 28 soon. August is pretty soon. I keep thinking I'm 28 now, so I must be coming up. May as well just get used to it. 

Recording: (7978/ 9621) 
 and I've been in Ohio since then. 

Recording: (7979/ 9621) 
 Not on airplanes, but on heating and cooling systems. 

Recording: (7980/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7981/ 9621) 
 My first job over here at the OSU Main Library was key punching. 

Recording: (7982/ 9621) 
 the younger kids wouldn't think anything about it. 

Recording: (7983/ 9621) 
 I like how everybody's just a little more relaxed about stuff. 

Recording: (7984/ 9621) 
 going to be law. It ain't going to come and get my story. So that means if you're working with me, 

Recording: (7985/ 9621) 
 I was very naive on that. I mean, I mean, you see it on the news and you bet the actual relationships and all that. But again, do you need to know that unless it pertains to you? And then even if it does pertain to you. 

Recording: (7986/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (7987/ 9621) 
 for over five years on purpose. I don't think it was supposed to be that long on purpose, but I wouldn't let myself date for a couple years after just trying to figure out. 

Recording: (7988/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (7989/ 9621) 
 In the home. 

Recording: (7990/ 9621) 
 And it was through Joseph Smith, and he translated the Book of Mormon with help from God. And so that's basically it. I mean, the Book of Mormon is a counterpart to the Bible. It's from prophets that lived in America. 

Recording: (7991/ 9621) 
 Oh, you are. I don't see a microphone in front of you. 

Recording: (7992/ 9621) 
 Right. And well, and there's nothing wrong with that. 

Recording: (7993/ 9621) 
 So I bought my house, you know, where I only had to drive two blocks, but then I had to move to Westerville. And one of my jobs there was I was a hiring supervisor for a department. And we had about 150 people in the department, and it was growing. And I wanted to hire minorities. 

Recording: (7994/ 9621) 
 Well, when I was a senior in high school, I wish my parents would have pushed me to do something practical, but I'm glad they didn't because it gave me a chance to make my own decisions. 

Recording: (7995/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (7996/ 9621) 
 All focus changes, it really does. 

Recording: (7997/ 9621) 
 Well, they knew all different things. I mean, culturally, you know, it was different music. Of course, I'm in a suburban high school in Cincinnati. You didn't get exposed to much. So that was the biggest thing. Well, of course, they talk funny in the East. But, you know, other than that, other than the culture shock, it wasn't that different. 

Recording: (7998/ 9621) 
 Same. 

Recording: (7999/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8000/ 9621) 
 I guess that's what it is, but I don't have a video camera either. But as soon as you said that, I thought I could just see him. 

Recording: (8001/ 9621) 
 Who's going to witness this now? There's no one here. 

Recording: (8002/ 9621) 
 Just really not extraordinarily different food necessarily, but just really 

Recording: (8003/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8004/ 9621) 
 Nowadays, you don't have that. 

Recording: (8005/ 9621) 
 OK. I think probably we should get going so that you can get out. I don't know what time it is. It's like 2 now. 

Recording: (8006/ 9621) 
 Feds have me tap now. I'm busted 

Recording: (8007/ 9621) 
 But full time, I would definitely go back when he's in school. 

Recording: (8008/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like a little kid. And he didn't say anything to me, but he made my aunt feel like a little pile of dirt, his sister. And so he just really showed out that day. But what's so funny is our baby, my dad has red hair, and our baby has red hair. 

Recording: (8009/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8010/ 9621) 
 Well, you need to go. 

Recording: (8011/ 9621) 
 I have one son, 19. He's trying to find himself. 

Recording: (8012/ 9621) 
 I'm still in it. 

Recording: (8013/ 9621) 
 It's a pretty dangerous drug I would say for the most part. Not so much the getting high part of it, but just what goes into it. 

Recording: (8014/ 9621) 
 But... 

Recording: (8015/ 9621) 
 Yes. So it's tough to go through. I guess he always did think he's a little on the extreme. 

Recording: (8016/ 9621) 
 Belgium, what do you think? Western Europe? Netherlands, Holland? Doesn't know his geography for shit. For the record. 

Recording: (8017/ 9621) 
 Well that's good. That's exciting. 

Recording: (8018/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8019/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8020/ 9621) 
 Yeah 

Recording: (8021/ 9621) 
 If it doesn't work, I'll get married. If it doesn't work, I'll just get a divorce. That's a great attitude to have, Amy. 

Recording: (8022/ 9621) 
 It was just... So I didn't object to that one at all. 

Recording: (8023/ 9621) 
 snobs. I'm from Palo Alto, don't talk to me. You know, you're not, you're not, you're not worthy. 

Recording: (8024/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8025/ 9621) 
 I know. the 10th graders. And I mean, just, you know, even their manuscript and you know, just how they wrote and I was like, Wow, I couldn't believe it. 

Recording: (8026/ 9621) 
 Bright! 

Recording: (8027/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (8028/ 9621) 
 I'm bouncing around too much. 

Recording: (8029/ 9621) 
 and 

Recording: (8030/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (8031/ 9621) 
 Yeah, as I was teasing. 

Recording: (8032/ 9621) 
 Not knowing if they're gonna whip out a gun or not, he ain't gonna go to jail. 

Recording: (8033/ 9621) 
 Oh, the technology is changing. I mean, the web has really revolutionized what we're doing. Well, anybody can connect to the web. 

Recording: (8034/ 9621) 
 Because this is a great area around here to live. And people, you know, like in Clintonville realize that. But then when you get a little more over where I am, my daughter was horrified, you know, that I wanted to buy a house over there. But I was single. 

Recording: (8035/ 9621) 
 He learned that from watching me do it. He takes, you know, when we come home, he'll take the thing back up for us. Oh, Martha, fault, she does this. I better run over there and take that up for her. Well, he's seen his mom and his dad do stuff like that. They really do learn best by example. They really do. Yeah, they do. They're much more likely to do what you do than do what you say. So you don't have to say anything as long as you live a good, clean, honest life. They're going to emulate you. 

Recording: (8036/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8037/ 9621) 
 Wow, that's intimidating. 

Recording: (8038/ 9621) 
 You could, but you could take it. 

Recording: (8039/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8040/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8041/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8042/ 9621) 
 I was like, no, I would not hold you gun when I want. Like one of my friends, he had a car alarm because he had some nice stuff in his car. His car alarm went off during school and he said he put his hand up and everything and told her that he needed to go outside because his car alarm was going off. And she said, no, you can do that on your time, sit down. He got all his stuff stolen out of his car. It's like, well, there that went, you know. Why, I mean, you can't even have nice stuff in your car anymore. 

Recording: (8043/ 9621) 
 I'm not sure where my father would have been, and my father was very liberal, more so even than my mother. Because if it's not something that's part of your culture every day, and you've been told it's wrong, and the Catholic Church said it was wrong, as most religions do, I'm sure he would have had some concern, but I think his intellect would eventually have worked it out, especially if he sat down and talked with him. And he wouldn't have done, you know, there wouldn't have been any gay bashing with him. There wouldn't have been, you know, what happened, you know, to the black man in Jasper, Texas, and the, you know, the shepherd boy in, what was that, Oklahoma. He wouldn't have, 

Recording: (8044/ 9621) 
 Well, I 

Recording: (8045/ 9621) 
 Okay, I thought they'd just be out walking around, you know? 

Recording: (8046/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8047/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8048/ 9621) 
 Right. There's a lot of money in town here and there's sometimes like you'll see a one entire airplane that goes to Cancun and it's like people are going on vacation or people are going to go gambling in Jamaica. That's all it is. So then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we're like who is that? 

Recording: (8049/ 9621) 
 No, he doesn't have anything. He won't talk to me yet. 

Recording: (8050/ 9621) 
 And they always, what made me mad about it is because everyone always thinks you're mad at them. 

Recording: (8051/ 9621) 
 But she's out there somewhere. We don't have clear evidence where she is. There were a couple of times where we thought we knew where Samantha was. When there were all those clones of her. I think that was in the second season or so. I think if they were going to end it, they were going to have to have like three episodes in a row that just were tying up all these loose ends that they keep having. I suspect they probably won't do that. They'll leave things open-ended for future TV movies or maybe another feature-length movie. 

Recording: (8052/ 9621) 
 When I was teaching it, that was kind of before all the moms went to work. 

Recording: (8053/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, and they just beat Indiana in basketball. 

Recording: (8054/ 9621) 
 You know, I don't... 

Recording: (8055/ 9621) 
 our kids' upbringing. Her mother was a cousin of James Thurber. 

Recording: (8056/ 9621) 
 their main purpose is that, you know. 

Recording: (8057/ 9621) 
 My supervisor is black. My last manager at the hospital was black. Plus my supervisor every day was black. My brother-in-law is black. My other brother-in-law is Arab. My other brother-in-law is Arab. Let's see. The kids that I just kept taking care of for my sister-in-law, they were all Arabs. The three kids I had living with me two summers ago were all black. 

Recording: (8058/ 9621) 
 This poor... 

Recording: (8059/ 9621) 
 No, I... 

Recording: (8060/ 9621) 
 It was, well it started out as computer science under the College of Arts and Sciences, but then there was this whole foreign language requirement and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually I became a proud member of the College of Business. 

Recording: (8061/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I'm like, oh, this is really interesting, you know, and then I'll drive along and people are just like, ah, blowing the horns. And I'm like, well, I could care less. 

Recording: (8062/ 9621) 
 I see it as a problem and if I were African American, I would not like to see it simply because it's a child not being brought up in his tradition. But on the other hand, I hate to see a child left in foster care or in an orphanage when he could have a home. And I think parents who are willing to adopt a black child or a mixed race child or an Asian child or any, are gonna be sensitive to cultural things because we're just, it's just the way things are slanted these days. I mean diversity diversity is an issue, and people who are willing to venture out into mixed-race adoption would already be way hipster. 

Recording: (8063/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well the first time I went officially with the exchange program, the second time I just went and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time, but I didn't go like under their insurance or on the same flight as them. I just kind of met up with them. 

Recording: (8064/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (8065/ 9621) 
 I

 for the system they have now. Keep punching the old card data into that. That was my first library job. 

Recording: (8067/ 9621) 
 I'm 18, dad dies. 

Recording: (8068/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8069/ 9621) 
 Well, we started down there and Francis, the goody two shoes, said, I'm going to tell mom. 

Recording: (8070/ 9621) 
 I wasn't really living. I was actually serving a mission for my church. 

Recording: (8071/ 9621) 
 I think I didn't know the difference so it didn't affect me at all. It's just, they're just another person. I think more as I'm being exposed to patients with the different lifestyles and knowing how to educate their caregivers and what they need. I felt somewhat ill-equipped the first few times, but knowing what the expectations are, especially like with spinal cord injury patients and when you go into sexuality and teaching them after injury, I mean as a nurse you need to be able to educate them. I felt pretty 

Recording: (8072/ 9621) 
 and you screwed something up. 

Recording: (8073/ 9621) 
 We just started reselling. 

Recording: (8074/ 9621) 
 And that's been almost 10 years. So hopefully.

 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다. 

Recording: (8076/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8077/ 9621) 
 That's about the same time my friend got hers. 

Recording: (8078/ 9621) 
 and that it was about to be restored again. And so we believe that the true church is actually restored again to the earth. 

Recording: (8079/ 9621) 
 Because I tell her things like, I said, you know what you really need to do is like in the morning when you're all done dressing, you look in the mirror and go, I look pretty good today. Or when you've done something like say, she's in a play right now. And when you come home at night, you need to look in the mirror and go, I did pretty good at the play today. Other people did well, but I think I did the best I've done so far, you know. And it's not to make yourself an egomaniac. It's just, you know, that's like those little subtle hints 

Recording: (8080/ 9621) 
 You know, like when I worked in Westerville, I had bought my house because I used to work off of East North Broadway and the freeway. And I thought I was going to be there forever. 

Recording: (8081/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8082/ 9621) 
 Shit man, so she drove me all the way out of that county to next county where the pancake place is So she went out of her way and out of her jurisdiction with this southern hospitality just to get me out of the weather 

Recording: (8083/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8084/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8085/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah, there can't be sanctions for doing the right thing. And so I'm opposed to that. Well, yeah, I guess you'd have to say that I would be opposed to arresting mothers for anything in that relation. That the effort should focus on getting them to stop, but not forcing them to stop whatever it is they're doing. 

Recording: (8086/ 9621) 
 There we go. 

Recording: (8087/ 9621) 
 Okay, so how you gonna help them when they're all over? 

Recording: (8088/ 9621) 
 as a toddler, and it's not intentional, it's just the way he is. So he was able to circumvent anything that the psychologist was trying until he had finally admitted that, yeah, he had a problem, and then things went much more smoothly. And that they're still not really convinced of the diagnosis, because there's multiple problems, and they haven't ruled out some of the other things yet. He just knew how to get around anything. 

Recording: (8089/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8090/ 9621) 
 But it wasn't because it caught fire. And that time, he was burned on the back. 

Recording: (8091/ 9621) 
 No, we, I generally try to keep her childhood her childhood, you know. There's a time to grow up and there's a time to be a child. And we divorced when she was eight years old. So I would get up every Saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that, you know. And try not to let her watch some of the ones that I didn't like, you know. And then the movies and stuff, we'd let her see some shoot see some shooting book movies and everything. But the weirdest movie she's seen was E.T. I remember that. I mean, 

Recording: (8092/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8093/ 9621) 
 Okay, that's a good job. I mean, because you get flex time. Yeah. 

Recording: (8094/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8095/ 9621) 
 Almost all the parents did. 

Recording: (8096/ 9621) 
 That's the grocery we use. Yeah. 

Recording: (8097/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (8098/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8099/ 9621) 
 So I mean, that's what I'm saying. I think it's even the American Disabilities Act talks about certain things about employers. And with my lawsuit, with the chill and with all the public trials of high profile trials, I think it's the education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work is not fair. It's a rich man's person or a rich person's system. Judges are bought and paid for. They're elected. There's a lot of crap there and I learned all this not from just my experience but from people that I know that are attorneys. That there are judges down there that take bribes. And that's not right. So you can't, when you're dealing with that system, justice comes at a price and you get as much justice as you can afford. And during my lawsuit, that was very evident. You know, laws are made to protect people that are wealthy and that commit crimes. And it's not right. It's not fair, but that's the way it is. So I didn't want to go into law. Didn't want to go into paralegal. I was looking into that and lady kept pounding me and telling me, you know, maybe you could get in it to make a difference. I'm like, why would I want to make a difference if it kills me? You know, because I know myself and I don't put up with crap. I see a liar, I bring him out. I was just brought up to be an honest person. Unfortunately, there's a lot of people out there that they sell out their ideals and their principles for $40,000 a year. Then they use their family or their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out. I'm not that kind of person and I won't ever be. So if that means that I stay monetarily poor for the rest of my life, then so be it. I got a conscience and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there. But that's basically where I've been. I've lived here my whole life, like I said. I went to college, I played baseball. Due to injuries, knees and shoulder, I was pro-caliber. I played baseball with Paul O'Neal and Kent Merker, which are a couple of guys that, you know, did get signed professionally and are playing right now. So at least I can say I played against him. And at least with Kent Merker, I can say I hit a home run off of him. So, that was a while ago, but it was when he was young and very good and I was still Can you tell me a little bit about what happened to Michelle and about your lawsuit? I don't follow that way anymore. I follow a more natural way of following God. Nothing new age. I don't want to say exactly what. I'm just saying that the people of this this land, long time ago before anybody came over here with their Bibles and crap, Raymond Jesus down in Peoples Third, the people of this land had a way of worshiping God, and that's the way I want to, that's the way I follow. So a lot of people say that's Native American, or say that's Indian, or whatever, you you know I don't care what they want to put on it, but it's It's it's a natural way of following God is the way I put it, you know Worshipping that and respecting the spirit that moves through all things all living things and So I went through all that and all those changes and are you know, coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them too. 

Recording: (8100/ 9621) 
 too much. 

Recording: (8101/ 9621) 
 said to me, that can't be wrong because the computer said that was a word. I said, that is a word. Come with me. I'll show you what a vestibule is. 

Recording: (8102/ 9621) 
 He is. 

Recording: (8103/ 9621) 
 I know, I know. Well, it's good to have that. I think it would be good to have that leeway. But I'm not sure I would trust myself because there were definitely times when I was teaching when I would have more of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others. And I wanted to be fair in terms of not cutting down the ones that I didn't like that much. Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (8104/ 9621) 
 You do. 

Recording: (8105/ 9621) 
 And I really feel like if you're going to run for president of the United States, you ought to be smart. 

Recording: (8106/ 9621) 
 There is, yeah. 

Recording: (8107/ 9621) 
 No, that's one thing that I found was really lacking here for my son. 

Recording: (8108/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, sure. 

Recording: (8109/ 9621) 
 He's really just, yeah, he doesn't think through the implications of things real well in his personal life. 

Recording: (8110/ 9621) 
 I mean obviously being a little boy I remember seeing things like football or whatever. You'd see something, you thought it was neat so you'd do it or whatever. 

Recording: (8111/ 9621) 
 Helps the curve. 

Recording: (8112/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it says. 

Recording: (8113/ 9621) 
 was working out there. 

Recording: (8114/ 9621) 
 I wish they could. 

Recording: (8115/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (8116/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah. It's kind of like making your mouth water when you see food. 

Recording: (8117/ 9621) 
 Columbus needs that as much as people don't want other things to close. I just feel we have to keep, we have to grow. Those people have to travel so far to shop and you know, I don't think that's really fair to them. 

Recording: (8118/ 9621) 
 To me that was very strange. 

Recording: (8119/ 9621) 
 Oh, she's cute. She really is really cute. I mean, I mean, she's got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks. 

Recording: (8120/ 9621) 
 It's always going to be somebody that can complain about something. Well, that's another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook. You know, everybody, most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water, make some toast, but you know, that's about all that they want to do as far as it comes to cooking, even if they do have to cook for their family. Not everybody, not every female likes to cook, you know, they just do it because, you know, they're supposed to or whatever. And I know some families where the men, the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking. And the wife does, you know, whatever she does. I mean, it's individuality again. So 

Recording: (8121/ 9621) 
 Okay, so people can like fly in, do their little wedding thing, fly out. 

Recording: (8122/ 9621) 
 Yeah. It is weird. This microphone is a little bit different. 

Recording: (8123/ 9621) 
 That doesn't so much bother me, it's just having it forced on me. Like I said, it just sort of gives me a different opinion of it. 

Recording: (8124/ 9621) 
 You even got these what stunt guns they're the ones that scare me 

Recording: (8125/ 9621) 
 Yeah, Jason and I went together. 

Recording: (8126/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8127/ 9621) 
 See there again, the business outfoxed the consumer. Basically, you need to do less consumption and buying material goods and sharing your time with one another, try to understand your neighbor more and spending time, getting quality time for understanding the intangibles of life. The tangibles depreciate and they will depreciate and will be nothing and your investment's gone. 

Recording: (8128/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8129/ 9621) 
 Well, that used to be where all the teenagers went. 

Recording: (8130/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. 

Recording: (8131/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8132/ 9621) 
 I mean, I feel, I lean toward no, I don't have a problem. Actually, I saw something on the news the other night about they were offering crack mothers money for sterilization, and there was a big debate about that. But again, the argument there on the human rights side was that if they're, you know, on cocaine or whatever, they can't make the sound decision to be sterilized. But at the same time, like, can they make the sound decision to have children? 

Recording: (8133/ 9621) 
 Because he, well I've had five babies, you know. I really have to work, when you talked about that, the older you get, I have to work really, really hard to stay in halfway decent shape. 

Recording: (8134/ 9621) 
 Love it. 

Recording: (8135/ 9621) 
 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다. 

Recording: (8136/ 9621) 
 No, I mean the money, you know, the money's great, you know, fine. It's the biggest raise I've ever given anybody here at the university. And actually the deal that they offered the Sunday before they went on on strike was a better deal than what they've really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more. And the big stipulation was the fact that these people didn't want to be separated from the hospital. They don't think it's fair, you know, that you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make 75 cents more an hour automatic. And then they did the raise and they wanted 80 cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff. So that's kind of a sticky situation because they've always kept the university and the hospital separate budget. They are definitely a separate budget. The hospital, I can see where they're coming from. Everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that. And they're 35 million in the hole because they bought OSU East and all this, you know, it's not the union's fault that they Ran out the contract, you know, and you know, so and what we find in our area mainly is that people the entrance wage is so low that It's hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs That's you know And they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever, but they're not willing to pay a lot of these people. They think contracting is the way, but you're always going to have to have people here because contractors just don't drop what they're doing and show up today. And a lot of times we have a job finished before they've written up the work order. 

Recording: (8137/ 9621) 
 Well, when you have formulas to make bombs and, you know...

 Mm-hmm. It's at the same building actually. It's said it's used for different things. 

Recording: (8139/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I was only 19. Well, I was 18 when I went in, but... 

Recording: (8140/ 9621) 
 Exactly, but I do, there's the other side with Native Americans too. It's, you know, our children are being taken away from us. Well, not exactly, you're giving up your children and something has to be done. But there's also that. I mean, I think it is probably a legitimate fear that children of that group are to be homogenized out of their heritage. But I don't know. They're kids without parents. 

Recording: (8141/ 9621) 
 I mean, there are gays in Congress, there are gays in the military. As long as people don't know, they don't feel threatened. See, and I don't understand that mindset. I really don't. I don't know why a man feels threatened by having a gay near them. I have a couple of gay friends, and one of my friends always says, you know, does every man like every woman he sees? Is he attracted to every woman? You know, want to go to bed with every woman? You know, what makes a man think that just because I'm gay I might be interested in him? You know, that's the height of arrogance. You know, but men feel threatened by that just as I guess women feel threatened by lesbians. I don't know, but it's not a mindset I have so it's hard for me to understand.

 four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Just to get a volume level. 

Recording: (8143/ 9621) 
 Okay, I might want to try to adjust this a little bit again. If you see it goes under, let me try putting it under here. I don't know if that would help. Yeah, it's probably going to stay better. 

Recording: (8144/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (8145/ 9621) 
 Mm-mm, he would absolutely have to build my trust for a long time. 

Recording: (8146/ 9621) 
 It was probably the best thing for me. 

Recording: (8147/ 9621) 
 but I just didn't hang out with the entire crowd. 

Recording: (8148/ 9621) 
 Right, you can get it walking down the street. 

Recording: (8149/ 9621) 
 which every kid in the world plays with. 

Recording: (8150/ 9621) 
 So, but, you know, I think, you know, a lot of times you think, well, you know, and you even know you sit there and say, I want a phone call, you know, all you do is call me, but it's not the same thing as being there. And she's, well, I remember one time when she was having a stomach ache, she was like 12 or 13 years old, you know, and I said, well, what's the matter? She goes, my stomach hurts. I said, oh, are you on your period or what? She goes, Dad, I'm on my period. 

Recording: (8151/ 9621) 
 There he is. 

Recording: (8152/ 9621) 
 He actually graduated with an accounting degree. 

Recording: (8153/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8154/ 9621) 
 Well, you have an upstairs and downstairs. Upstairs is the tower and there's like a ground control, a clearance delivery which reads all the clearances to all the airplanes and the ground control taxes them to and from the runway and the tower works everybody landing and departing or any airplane within five mile radius. Then once they get out of that radius downstairs, which is called the approach control, they work everything from there to 10,000 feet and out to about 60 miles. And when they get to that point, then they go to the enroute centers. 

Recording: (8155/ 9621) 
 I've thought about that. It's sad. I mean, that's why I haven't went to college or anything because there's nothing my mind has set on that I want to do in life. I just want to be rich. 

Recording: (8156/ 9621) 
 Everyone's like, you got it lucky. I'm like, well, it's going to catch up. Just wait. 

Recording: (8157/ 9621) 
 Well, something that I wanted to get into some kind of counseling with people that have been through traumatic experiences. But I need to be at a point where, you know, I'm in my recovery where I know I won't be sucked back down into their way of thinking. So it's a step-by-step process. I tried to go into counseling for chemical addictions, you know, for alcohol and drugs, but the bullshit excuses I kept hearing from these addicts was just too much to take. And even the bullshit excuses from former addicts. 

Recording: (8158/ 9621) 
 Cry. 

Recording: (8159/ 9621) 
 But my son, he's so... I mean, I don't know if you've ever met anybody that's totally into politics. 

Recording: (8160/ 9621) 
 and you get the shooting out in Honolulu and the next day there's another one. It's just kind of like that syndrome you know well at least I can be popular for 15 minutes or whatever. I mean I'm not saying not to cover it but yeah and then of course you have the whole gun control stuff that's just ridiculous. 

Recording: (8161/ 9621) 
 If we stayed here, probably. 

Recording: (8162/ 9621) 
 When I was a kid, if a neighbor yelled at me, I better make damn sure he didn't tell my dad. 

Recording: (8163/ 9621) 
 We needed that. 

Recording: (8164/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8165/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he says he knows VMS as well, but he doesn't like to do it, so he doesn't do it. 

Recording: (8166/ 9621) 
 So there was a wadi they call it, it was like a little deep oysh. 

Recording: (8167/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8168/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8169/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8170/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8171/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8172/ 9621) 
 I think that's a cop out myself. 

Recording: (8173/ 9621) 
 Oh, it was nice, actually. I ate a lot more healthy and it was cheaper. I was getting money on my BuckID. So I actually got paid every day. 

Recording: (8174/ 9621) 
 you know, imagine it and that's basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids by three different dads and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually had her move in with them. They were her temporary foster parents and she just turned 16, so she was 15 when she moved in with them. She refused to change and I don't know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier but basically all three of them I don't want to say are doomed but they're not even though they're out of that environment they're not doing any better 

Recording: (8175/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (8176/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you still have to be careful. 

Recording: (8177/ 9621) 
 So let's say she was in a situation where she had some sort of bills to pay, you know, the one environment was a much more close-knit type school community than the. It wouldn't be long term. And they would know that it would not be long term. But that's that intangible, I'm saying. You have somebody there because she's giving up her time, not to make the high bucks, but what she's bringing about is developing a character in a person to bring about the spirituality in a person that's going to carry them all through life. She's also tithing, more than tithing probably, which I always kid with people, I said the author said 10% tithing knew inflation, he knew great about economics, 10% is 10%. And then on top of that, we talk about economics a little further here, the Japanese, so forth, they save so much more than the Germans and so forth. And boy, taking the page out of the old Bible, aren't they? We don't. 

Recording: (8178/ 9621) 
 Yeah, because it's the Midwest. Yeah. 

Recording: (8179/ 9621) 
 Well, like I'm getting ready to go through layoffs again where I work at. 

Recording: (8180/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (8181/ 9621) 
 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다. 

Recording: (8182/ 9621) 
 because that's more boring. 

Recording: (8183/ 9621) 
 I and you to outspoken about that. So rather than banging my head on the wall to people who wouldn't listen, I just decided to leave the church. I don't go there anymore. The only time I've gone there was for my nephew's baptism and my grandparents' funeral. And that's the only time you'll find me in there. I went to a wedding too, but it's difficult sitting in there because of the way I follow now and actually seeing things for what they are. And it's frustrating not being able to explain that to people, but that's okay. The lawsuit, we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they had all that higher, taller glass back there over a year. So they tried to use the excuse. Their excuse was that they couldn't find the hardware to install it. And given all the hardware stores that we have here and the ability to overnight freight things, if there was any kind of special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country, there's no excuse. So basically, it came down to a legal battle, which was I was not going to back down. I was poor monetarily, they knew that. So they were using the legal system to wear me down. The first, at the date of filing, I mean, first of all, it took, I had a statute of limitations, it was two years. I had an attorney and a law firm representing me, but they were dragging their feet. I felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill. You know. And that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet. Even though I knew the guy. So I just said, well look, I'm dissatisfied. I'm gonna go find another attorney. So give me my file. See ya. And I went shopping around for a new attorney. It took me about seven before, pardon me, seven attorneys before I found one that was adequate in terms of knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and he had experience and expertise in bringing up the differences and the realities of a brain injury and the effects, the lifelong effects. So after the two years, we got in just under the two years. So I mean, hell that would be what it happened in 93. So just under December 95, the day, the last day of the statute running out, we filed. So we got it filed. Once it was filed, the judge scheduled a hearing and for whatever stupid reason, the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed. So you can see when you get in to bed with, you know, and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multi-million dollar lawsuit or whatever, you know, any kind of lawsuit, the big boys get all the breaks. So, in my opinion, the judge didn't want to hear the case before then, or maybe his docket was full, but I'm saying, you know, there's no prioritization in the legal system. There are some things that should be addressed soon. I shouldn't have to wait that long. So then, it came down to one week prior to the hearing, and I got a letter from my attorney, and he said that that and also a phone call from the office saying that That they Were filing a continuance Which meant that the judge granted them an additional year of discovery Whatever Whatever the law says, you know, the judge says he has to back it up. But, so I postponed the trial for another year, which pissed me off, you know. But that's exactly what they were planning on, you know, wearing me down, like I said. Knowing that I don't have the money to throw in there and say, hey, you know, um, but they know full well that we had all the evidence that we had to sell, uh, that just postponed it for another year. Finally, we got into, uh, coming in and then they, uh, sent a letter saying they wanted to meet for arbitration to see if we could hammer out some kind of settlement a couple months before the trial. I was unaware of this common practice, but it was a very iffy situation. Juries here in Columbus have been ultra conservative They feel that people for some reason or another That people that have been legitimately injured in their lives have been affected that they don't deserve money for whatever reason And I don't think it's fair that they can sit back and be that conservative if it hasn't happened to them. I don't think that's fair. Because it does affect your entire life. It has. Otherwise I'd be full-time employed. I'd be gainfully employed and making money and I'm not. And that's not because of anything. It's by choices on my part, but it's, you know, there's a lot there, the betrayal that I've had to struggle with, there's a lot there that, you know, I feel I've been betrayed by everybody that taught me. I feel betrayed by the government, by the legal system, by the politicians, by all the people that have been put in charge to protect people, to protect ideals, to protect principles, throw it out the window for money. And then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt, it got down to just dollars and cents bartering for what my life was worth. And it's the bidding started at $125,000. Now I feel I'm worth more than that. I feel you can't put a value on a human life. There were just subtle things that my sense of taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half. Just all the trauma that goes along with it, not just the physical trauma, I mean, that was enough to kill anybody, but because of me, because of my size, because of my strength, I wasn't killed, you know. So the physical burden still remains. I was and is worse. Having to have a lack of money now means lack of socializing, means lack of going and doing things. Don't have a lot of relationships, don't have a girlfriend, don't have a wife, nothing like that. I've got a dog, a golden retriever,

 much in school with that. 

Recording: (8185/ 9621) 
 Sure.

 Yeah, I mean there's like a lot of kids who are different but just like not the majority or whatever. 

Recording: (8187/ 9621)

 I'm not.

Recording: (8190/ 9621) 
 Oh, I can whip up a mean fish, especially when I go out. We're closer to the fishing area now. I caught dinner the other night. And, heck, just about anything I can make turn in. I like to get a patent on a certain kind of omelet. I'm not going to, you know. 

Recording: (8191/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8192/ 9621) 
 Right, and I'm sure it will, especially when you already recognize that. You know, if you already know in advance what kinds of things you're going to be helping along, it's a lot easier than trying to figure out what's going on here, you know? 

Recording: (8193/ 9621) 
 and where my mom was a young high school student, just graduating from high school. And so they got together there, moved to California. 

Recording: (8194/ 9621) 
 I have my mother's family in Mansfield. 

Recording: (8195/ 9621) 
 For Columbus. 

Recording: (8196/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's Russia. In the Ural Mountains. No, not... I don't even know where that is. That's pretty terrible, but I don't think it is. 

Recording: (8197/ 9621) 
 Ernest had hiked up her skirt and I'd rolled up my pants leg and well I was probably not over knee deep but I think I was good talking to is all we ever got out of it. 

Recording: (8198/ 9621) 
 So I was the second generation of his, because he was like 57 years old when I was born. So probably the last thing he really wanted was another kid. 

Recording: (8199/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8200/ 9621) 
 Oh, okay. Small world. 

Recording: (8201/ 9621) 
 I like Star Trek. 

Recording: (8202/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8203/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, you just send that right all over, but you don't want to tell how many people live in your house. 

Recording: (8204/ 9621) 
 Pfft. 

Recording: (8205/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8206/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8207/ 9621) 
 Yeah, like they all get the option, but I understand very few exercise it. So, you know, if they were to not give them the tuition that they could, that most of them aren't using, and then give them the $2 an hour, you know, but then that could, then you could say that OSU is helping to keep people down. And so you have to still, it's an odd balance there, it is. And like, something like that doesn't seem too skilled to me me so I don't really know why there's much of a union for that but obviously there 

Recording: (8208/ 9621) 
 I think that's really a major problem, and I think there's a lot of problem with young kids today. Do it my way, or they all hit them, or... 

Recording: (8209/ 9621) 
 with my kid. 

Recording: (8210/ 9621) 
 But it's just me, you know. I told her, I tried to tell her, you know. I'm not in any kind of writing special program or anything like that. I'm not a doctor, that's for damn sure. Driving an 85 truck. 

Recording: (8211/ 9621) 
 We pay like 40 or 50 here. Oh yeah. Well, there's like, you take federal and state and all that and I don't know. 

Recording: (8212/ 9621) 
 Yeah, if she passed 100 people and 99 of them said, oh, that's really pretty hair. Oh, those are nice earrings. Oh, that's a nice shirt. Those are nice pants. And one guy goes, what's with that lipstick? She will remember that what's with that lipstick for about a month. And I'm like, gosh. And it's sad. 

Recording: (8213/ 9621) 
 When's your PhD come in? I got it. Ah. 

Recording: (8214/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8215/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8216/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly. It's a very conservative town. 

Recording: (8217/ 9621) 
 That'd be great. But what I was most worried about was all the equipment and stuff that was in the truck. I mean there's a 2,000 pound forklift back there and you're not gonna just dodge that. 

Recording: (8218/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and looking your house the neighbors right behind you you're staring at them sitting on their deck. We got all woods and a creek and then the golf course. So that's hard to find in the city limits because we're inside 270 still so. 

Recording: (8219/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8220/ 9621) 
 It depends on what area you live in too. The area where I live in, you get little house because you're close to everything. Whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of the area, you can get a bigger house. There's some really, really pretty ones. 

Recording: (8221/ 9621) 
 It's just like a miniature version of Ohio State. 

Recording: (8222/ 9621) 
 come to offer me that or tell, I mean she's the first, I never even heard of it. And there's all kinds of programs that you know, like there's this one that where like say I live with my mom, my mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be living there, you know, because she kind of helps me out, you know. And I don't know what that was called. I mean, I'm just now finding this stuff out, you know. It's like, I guess I can apply for welfare in that. 

Recording: (8223/ 9621) 
 And I did a lot of music interviewing and writing there, and then I moved up to editor. And it was sort of through that job that I got my first job with Sony while I was as a sort of Ohio representative. So I was concentrated in Ohio State. And then, you know, basically, it's just something, I'm not doing this as a career, it's just sort of something I'm doing in the meantime till I decide whether I'm going back to school or, 

Recording: (8224/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8225/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (8226/ 9621) 
 bump. 

Recording: (8227/ 9621) 
 That's right. Well, they don't. They don't give them, I don't know, maybe they give each one one free ticket or something. The rest of them have to pay. 

Recording: (8228/ 9621) 
 I think it's good and I think women are capable of doing that. My only disagreement with it is that I'd have a real problem being in that boxhole and have a woman beside me. If she gets shot, I don't know how I could deal with that. Men, I don't know, women have different feelings about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other than they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective 

Recording: (8229/ 9621) 
 Those are unsettling times though, you know.

 I got a son and then he's got a son, so I guess I'm a grandfather. I hardly ever see him.

 Hmm. 

Recording: (8242/ 9621) 
 I can't imagine that it would have, I mean I'm sure Brazil would have been an even more different experience, but I think it was more just a resentment for sort of everything about America and what they're fed. It was a real love-hate relationship.

 If it was a class I knew I had to take, I didn't really want to. That's what you do. You just get through it. 

Recording: (8244/ 9621) 
 I honestly don't think that that really has much to do with it. Obviously it does put the idea in the kids heads but it's been there for a long time. 

Recording: (8245/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so... 

Recording: (8246/ 9621) 
 I want I don't want somebody I want them to be able to feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can

 That's what you better have.

 Not in sort of an evil sense, necessarily, but just in sort of a challenging sense consistently. Yes, there was some sort of inherent communication breakdown. My mother's kind of a flake. Not that I'm not a flake, but we're flaking in different ways.

 But you know they tend to say I'd say of those there's about three three to four of them that are Vietnam veterans a day and they tend to come back I mean I just really started going in there just drinking coffee, you know kill time and everything, you know, then I Kind of know everybody, you know, and somebody walk in I say, yeah, it's going, you know and they'll talk there, there's another thing too about a lot of the people back, Vietnam era and everything, that they'll tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else, like an authoritative figure, and not believe a damn word they say. 

Recording: (8251/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's just amazing. When she went to her Lamaze class, she said, Mom, you won't believe it. Half of these, they couldn't get up off the floor or anything. They were all having trouble. And she said, there I was with my cupcakes and my Cheetos. And she said, they all had bottled water. But she's, like I said, she just turned 28. 

Recording: (8252/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we're into that. Well, I'm into that. I'm into the competitive thing. But, you know, yeah, he comes home and it's like, well, you take him and he's like, why? I just got home. I'm tired. I'm like, OK, you sit home with him all day, OK? And you go, I talk to him like I would do it like I'm talking to you. 

Recording: (8253/ 9621) 
 and tried to get my family in it with some success, not as much as I'd like, but I think they're all responsible, well-adjusted people and have families of their own. I have nine grandchildren, one great-grandson, and the boys are all on the sheet metal trade also. One of them is working over here on the stadium. 

Recording: (8254/ 9621) 
 But historically, women were not, it was a man's field, and even women who were doing it and doing it well didn't get the attention, didn't get

 I don't really work with them, all I basically do is I know a lot of people and everything and they tend to come in there for help and I just kind of help out with the... 

Recording: (8258/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8259/ 9621) 
 But they didn't say nothing to me because they knew the reason why. It's because I carried the borrower's receipts. Now I could see the carrying one to that degree, but there's a limit. You got all these people carrying guns because they'll tell you, well, it's the neighborhood I live in. Or you have women carrying guns even down here on campus because they walk late at night. 

Recording: (8260/ 9621) 
 Bleh.

 God. In breathing that, it's like when we were in the womb of our mother, we were breathing water, we were breathing fluid. Oxygen is in that fluid too. It's in that mist that goes over the fields.

 Yeah.

 I play the French horn. I don't think I said that before. And I sing tenor and mostly choir stuff, but I've done a few small solo things.

 Yes.

 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다. 

Recording: (8270/ 9621) 
 I've lived in Columbus all my life. I can't say I ever really leave too often. I have a brother, a sister, obviously parents. They're divorced. I live with my mom. We live up around the Beachwild area. Really as far as Ohio State goes, I'm a freshman here. I just started winter quarter. I like it for the most part. It's a little bit much, much different actually than high school was and that kind of surprised me. Just all the sorts of changes and things like that going on. But other than that, I mean, I seem to like it. I mean, it's definitely changes for the better. It's a lot more just free. I mean, you get to do whatever you want. I mean, there's no one watching over you saying what you have to do all the time and everything like that. 

Recording: (8271/ 9621) 
 have it meeting the missionaries. 

Recording: (8272/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8273/ 9621) 
 for a long period of time. 

Recording: (8274/ 9621) 
 Why even add that? 

Recording: (8275/ 9621) 
 I just think you can't call for across the board raises. There are definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they're getting. 

Recording: (8276/ 9621)

 under whatever system is popular that day, or card games. 

Recording: (8278/ 9621) 
 right 

Recording: (8279/ 9621) 
 not too far from here. 

Recording: (8280/ 9621) 
 where they could go somewhere else. 

Recording: (8281/ 9621) 
 there. 

Recording: (8282/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8283/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8284/ 9621) 
 Well, I've been married and divorced and I have an 18-year-old daughter. They live in St. Louis. I worked at Ashland Chemical for about 13 years in administrative management. I went through some bad times there and everything. I like calling it working for myself because I work through a temporary agency. I work when I want to and do what I want to do. But it gets kind of old too, you know. Like all this week I haven't been able to get out, you know. 

Recording: (8285/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah, I don't feel that I don't feel I don't feel like I fit in with the teenagers anymore either. Mm hmm. 

Recording: (8286/ 9621) 
 I just didn't want to do that. A lot of people do that, but you know, it's just such an investment then when you leave. 

Recording: (8287/ 9621) 
 So things have come a little bit better, but there's still such restrictions with women. 

Recording: (8288/ 9621) 
 Definitely. 

Recording: (8289/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8290/ 9621) 
 Well, you only had to be at your locker at a designated time. 

Recording: (8291/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and the smaller house, like bigger squished in areas, are the older area. 

Recording: (8292/ 9621) 
 I mean I just even noticed like road rage just in general like with myself when I was working full-time even with my child at home. Just the frustration of getting home. I was so stressed with work and now being part-time. 

Recording: (8293/ 9621) 
 Okay. I grew up in Canton, which is near Cleveland. I moved here in 92 to go to college. I spent my senior year abroad in England. Then I came back. I have double major and I had a quarter to finish off. And I came back and did that. And then I went back to England to work and then came back and went back to England again and came back and I'm a freelance right now, freelance writer and editor. 

Recording: (8294/ 9621) 
 They can be paying me to go to finish high school and they can also, they'll also pay me to finish college and they'll help me out. I haven't seen anyone. 

Recording: (8295/ 9621) 
 The only way I moved was if the neighborhood went down. And when I say went down, I'm talking about way down. Because I like where I'm at. 

Recording: (8296/ 9621) 
 I don't agree with it, we had gays in there when I was in there, you know, so. 

Recording: (8297/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8298/ 9621) 
 Yeah And I sure don't want to vote for Al Gore 

Recording: (8299/ 9621) 
 They weren't all Columbus people. Some of them sort of flew in, visited for the job. There was a little bit of prestige. I won some competition a couple years ago about upcoming conductors.

 West Broad Street. 

Recording: (8301/ 9621) 
 Oh my gosh. 

Recording: (8302/ 9621) 
 That was always too subjective for me. 

Recording: (8303/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8304/ 9621) 
 That's too true. 

Recording: (8305/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (8306/ 9621) 
 I mean I'm all for anything. I could do the sales, I could do the purchasing. I pretty much can do anything I can be taught to do. 

Recording: (8307/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (8308/ 9621) 
 i've been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up with like heroin and things like that 

Recording: (8309/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (8310/ 9621) 
 a baby, a biracial baby, which worked out. Jesse's the sweetest kid in the whole world. My mom's friend Colin's a teacher, and she watched Jesse for a good three years during the day. Colin paid her, obviously. She really enjoyed that. Something that she could do at home. If she wanted to go out and run errands, she could take Jesse with her. 

Recording: (8311/ 9621) 
 So they were really hypocritical. 

Recording: (8312/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8313/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8314/ 9621) 
 Bye. 

Recording: (8315/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8316/ 9621) 
 Stuff like that. 

Recording: (8317/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8318/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's my daughter. Yeah. 

Recording: (8319/ 9621) 
 You know what I mean? I mean, I hope we're getting to the place we know that. 

Recording: (8320/ 9621) 
 Hmm 

Recording: (8321/ 9621) 
 I think my mother was okay with it. All the conversations we had about it since then lead me to believe, yes, this didn't traumatize her. I think it was kind of a no-brainer for her as well. She's like, ah, yeah, all your friends and your dad, or a large new experience that you don't know anything about and me. Talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair. 

Recording: (8322/ 9621) 
 Not really. I mean, I don't think they'd come to any more difficult conclusions than guys had coming up to. 

Recording: (8323/ 9621) 
 She'll make Pico overdue. Not like he has a lot of choice. 

Recording: (8324/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8325/ 9621) 
 Thank you very much. 

Recording: (8326/ 9621) 
 Now I work for the company but I consult on a lot of projects within the company. Yeah, we're doing pretty well. It's about $150 million business. 

Recording: (8327/ 9621) 
 Now if I shoot you, they might do something. Don't get me wrong. But I mean, if I shoot you, they might do something. But otherwise, they ain't going to do nothing. 

Recording: (8328/ 9621) 
 of the year, I mean, it just got to the point where I'd had enough and I didn't want to go anymore. 

Recording: (8329/ 9621) 
 But they always say don't let the animals sleep with you and all that. And with the cat, they curl up with you. It's hard to say. No, but you know what? Honestly, eventually, well, it took probably a year. 

Recording: (8330/ 9621) 
 Not badly. Marketing is not my strong suit. I mean most of the stuff that I get is just an accident. I started working for OSU because another illustrator that they used who wasn't going to be able to do the work anymore recommended me. You know that kind of thing. But he was a guy. 

Recording: (8331/ 9621) 
 I'm not gonna say it. 

Recording: (8332/ 9621) 
 some of the work that needs to be done. 

Recording: (8333/ 9621) 
 And then my oldest son's wife is a secretary in a school. 

Recording: (8334/ 9621) 
 So, I mean, he's responding. 

Recording: (8335/ 9621) 
 So you know what I mean, I can outlast them. 

Recording: (8336/ 9621) 
 It's very difficult. 

Recording: (8337/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, something, coffee, donuts, you know. 

Recording: (8338/ 9621) 
 Shopping, you know it, but it's just become a really good metropolitan city. I mean it's on its way 

Recording: (8339/ 9621) 
 people to whom people were to which is crap as well so i don't do that 

Recording: (8340/ 9621) 
 to is sacred, it's a sacred fire. So that's why it's possible. But if I went down there with the laws of physics and told me that those rocks couldn't sustain heat, yet I see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they're red-orange glowing, you're going to tell me they're not hot? So that's one example. 

Recording: (8341/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (8342/ 9621) 
 And they work hard to make it easier on the students. They totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year. 

Recording: (8343/ 9621) 
 Well, some of them are, I guess, depending on where they go. But I had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid, she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class that hasn't gone to preschool or daycare. And she said it takes that kid up till Christmas to catch up with the things the other kids come in already knowing. That's how far behind they are. Used to be in kindergarten you were expected to know your colors and your name and your address. You didn't even have to write it. You just had to know how to say it and your phone number and recognize the color words and know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills. And that was about all they expect you to do, play cooperatively. That's about all they expect you to know. Now in kindergarten, they expect you to know all of that, plus by the time you get to first grade, you're supposed to have all the numbers you used to, from one to thirty, it used to be if you could say them in order and recognize them. You didn't even have to know how to spell the word or write them down. Now they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred. You're supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade. 

Recording: (8344/ 9621) 
 I think he needs counseling at that point. 

Recording: (8345/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's the way, that's the way you really should be. I mean, you got to be ready for tournament time, you know. 

Recording: (8346/ 9621) 
 For me personally, family being close, both sides of the family are here. For me, familiarity. I don't like a lot of change, a lot of new things. For me, I was involved in, I swam for OSU Swimming and got real involved with the OSU sports and just the sporting programs. And I love Ohio State football, so I like the sports. There are a lot of activities to do too now with my little boy going to Kosai and the zoo and just knowing where things are and how to get around. 

Recording: (8347/ 9621) 
 So in one way it's kind of a blessing. 

Recording: (8348/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8349/ 9621) 
 I had three months and then it got postponed then I got postponed again and I was like this is stupid in exchange for postponing it again my rationale was fine I'll give myself another 10 days 

Recording: (8350/ 9621) 
 Yes, it does, definitely. He went on a mission to Texas and he's been back for a while. He's 32. Well, he'll be 32 in April. 

Recording: (8351/ 9621) 
 They can't fathom that. 

Recording: (8352/ 9621) 
 I think so. 

Recording: (8353/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I did. 

Recording: (8354/ 9621) 
 Really? I haven't noticed that yet. 

Recording: (8355/ 9621) 
 Namaste. 

Recording: (8356/ 9621) 
 Not directly, but indirectly. So I certainly didn't want to be elected. 

Recording: (8357/ 9621) 
 either role-playing games. 

Recording: (8358/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (8359/ 9621) 
 Um, 

Recording: (8360/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't understand it. I really have a hard time understanding, you know, they're not after you. They just want to live a life. 

Recording: (8361/ 9621) 
 FLOWERS AND 

Recording: (8362/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8363/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, almost always. Doesn't matter what the disability is. And I don't know why this is, but they used to say eight to one. Now they're saying more like five to one. Doesn't matter if it's a speech impediment, blindness, retardation, cerebral palsy, deafness, learning disability, you name it, there's five to one more boys than there are girls. And we don't know why. 

Recording: (8364/ 9621) 
 four or five 

Recording: (8365/ 9621) 
 Well, at the time they were having a lot of trouble at the school and they just wanted to get rid of some people. 

Recording: (8366/ 9621) 
 I'm waiting for it. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm waiting for it. 

Recording: (8367/ 9621) 
 Yet they pray a prayer every Sunday and we believe in the seen and unseen. I'll never forget it, because I recited it for God knows how many years. But when you talk to them about possession, when you talk to them about demons or spirits, they freak out. 

Recording: (8368/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8369/ 9621) 
 But yeah, it's a cool head on her shoulder. She wouldn't let that happen, unless she told me about it. She'd probably be afraid to tell me that I'd catch an airplane flight down over there or something, you know, hook the guy up or something. 

Recording: (8370/ 9621) 
 I'm not actually sure. 

Recording: (8371/ 9621) 
 They said, for a health reason, you'd have to eat meat. There's no way someone could tell me that I would have to eat meat. 

Recording: (8372/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was a homemade bow and arrow. 

Recording: (8373/ 9621) 
 Our school wasn't really a violent one. There weren't really any fights or anything. 

Recording: (8374/ 9621) 
 And so I think it gets driven home. I think the media does that in a lot of places. They pick something that's sensational and they're making it even more sensational. Like when John Kennedy died. 

Recording: (8375/ 9621) 
 Waterberry. 

Recording: (8376/ 9621) 
 Yeah, now if you, the thing to do is if you know the call sign. 

Recording: (8377/ 9621) 
 and then on out and the enemy was over there. Well, they put us in the front of that mountain right down there. 

Recording: (8378/ 9621) 
 His dad's a graduate of Stanford, but he is, they never leave there. I mean, that's an excellent medical school and everything, but those football players, they're smart. They don't quit, you know? I mean, it's amazing. They never do. 

Recording: (8379/ 9621) 
 A lot of good investments, a lot of saving, a lot of living well below means and owning six businesses. Yeah, his definition of retired is basically he doesn't have to work. He does, but he doesn't have to. He just finished up a temp job up at Quest. I think he gets paid like $3.75 an hour now. 

Recording: (8380/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8381/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8382/ 9621) 
 Have you ever met somebody like that? 

Recording: (8383/ 9621) 
 Well, it's, well let's put it this way. I can go out and make money without even making money off of government agencies if I wanted to. If I wanted to be a crook, I could be a crook and I could have people rent me a house, low income, I could move in there. 

Recording: (8384/ 9621) 
 TV about and everything that stuff's been going on for years. 

Recording: (8385/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8386/ 9621) 
 uh... so uh... who christian and i uh... spent the rest of the evening calling people uh... i got in my head i didn't want anybody to call and say how you get it and so the best way to do with that situation to call globally cross the board plus it was a fun psychological experiment just as as they go how can you get to tell people that's good that's good himself morning? So, I'm like, hi, how you doing? No, I haven't talked to you in a little while. Is everything okay? Actually, no, my father killed himself this morning. You're kidding. So you end up, after a dozen or so people, narrowing it down. You're kidding? You're not serious? No. 

Recording: (8387/ 9621) 
 just from doing that but when you have a dog why bother and they won't allow dogs so she's not allowed to go over there so she's always like but it does make a big difference so I guess that's what I'm saying for them 

Recording: (8388/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's the bureaucracy. It'd be too much of a struggle, I think. 

Recording: (8389/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8390/ 9621) 
 You know, so they offered to send me to med school here. 

Recording: (8391/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8392/ 9621) 
 It's the article. 

Recording: (8393/ 9621) 
 on. 

Recording: (8394/ 9621) 
 So. 

Recording: (8395/ 9621) 
 I've heard some of them talk about it. 

Recording: (8396/ 9621) 
 So I don't know, maybe it is a little bit more dangerous. But I think that comes with a bigger city. When you get more people, there's obviously going to be some more problems. And I mean, that's really all that I noticed. It's obviously a lot more buildup. It's gotten a lot more commercial, things like city center. 

Recording: (8397/ 9621) 
 That makes sense. And a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans. People go nuts. People would rather see a tight game that was like 7 to like 6 rather than watch like a 2 to 1 ball game. 

Recording: (8398/ 9621) 
 real positive about it. But basically I lived here for my whole life and I grew up on campus. 

Recording: (8399/ 9621) 
 I thought it was 43. 

Recording: (8400/ 9621) 
 You puke up. 

Recording: (8401/ 9621) 
 Everybody lives on a farm. 

Recording: (8402/ 9621) 
 Oh, he's dead. 

Recording: (8403/ 9621) 
 And, of course, Bill Moulton was the greatest. I mean, have you seen his cartoons? 

Recording: (8404/ 9621) 
 Throw Nerf balls in the audience. 

Recording: (8405/ 9621) 
 as to what the sanctuary should be like. So we had a tour. The choir took a tour. Our choir director arranged it to about five or six churches in the Columbus area to sing in them. And not for an audience, but just to sing and to see which ones we liked the acoustics of. And that was interesting. We sang in Central Presbyterian Church downtown, which is where one of my orchestras plays a lot. And we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about and what we didn't. Maybe it had some feedback. I think the new building is acoustically very good. It's certainly much better than old worship center because I don't know if you've seen a picture or anything of the church, but the old worship center was designed by a modern architect to be a modern quote-unquote type building in 1962 and it's yeah, it, it's flat. There's a flat roof with a clear story in the middle. It has nothing in it. It's just empty space over the worship center. So when you would sing in that as a choir, you spread out along the front, if you were under the high place, your voice would go all the way to the back. But if you were under this flat ceiling that's only about nine or 10 feet high, it was dead. It was just muffled. And it was terrible acoustically. But we made do with it for many years. And then we had the chance to get this input into this new building, and it's it's a it's really beautiful. It's a circular almost circular big space with a high point in the middle of the roof and It's it's nice Well you could still go it's they won't have they won't have a lot of 

Recording: (8406/ 9621) 
 So, yeah, those places were probably about 30 years old. You know, fire hazards, insulation just, you know, fire hazard everywhere. 

Recording: (8407/ 9621) 
 I know I've done studies, and I took some of those classes, and you just think about it that way. The nurse said something like, you take everything for a fact, and I thought that was strange, but I think there are a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that I would want to do it for a while, as long as I could. 

Recording: (8408/ 9621) 
 Well, well, yeah, well librarians traditionally have problems with, it's like a form of censorship. You know, big brother things. Librarians have always had problems with that. I don't know, it's hard to balance it. If somebody's out there actually doing criminal work, criminal activity and causing damage, you want to know about it, but how do you do that and still protect the rights of everybody else? I don't know how to balance it. 

Recording: (8409/ 9621) 
 As far as my brother goes, I can't say I really see my brother too often. He does live in town, but usually he's either at work, because he works full time, then he's a part-time student at Columbus State. So I don't really see him during the day, and then at night he usually goes out and does his thing, I go out and do my thing. So as far as what's going on with him, I really don't know, but I know, I mean, there's nothing real serious going on with him or anything like that. 

Recording: (8410/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8411/ 9621) 
 Like here I've been told you know, they've been here for a while then there wasn't any parties here for a little while and then I've been the ones in Cleveland since he Dayton Akron Detroit, New York, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia 

Recording: (8412/ 9621) 
 I'm really lucky. Everyone's always cramming about their horrible kids. And my kids are phenomenal. We have this arrangement. I do everything I possibly can to make them happy. 

Recording: (8413/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8414/ 9621) 
 I mean, the fact of the matter is, a lot of people out there, I guess, could be child molesters or whatever. I mean, it doesn't matter if they're straight or gay or whatever. The fact of the matter is, I mean, they're out there. 

Recording: (8415/ 9621) 
 I know Steve, my husband, sometimes, I mean we've taken Joey out to the cemetery a few times to go to the grave site of his mother and he says, you know, very often, boy she would really like to have been here and done things with him. 

Recording: (8416/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8417/ 9621) 
 you know, which when you should is a better way of putting it. 

Recording: (8418/ 9621) 
 네. 

Recording: (8419/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8420/ 9621) 
 tradition. 

Recording: (8421/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (8422/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8423/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (8424/ 9621) 
 Oh, right. 

Recording: (8425/ 9621) 
 See what kind of things you're ordering, where your hits are on the internet. 

Recording: (8426/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8427/ 9621) 
 See, I would be all up in the room, too, looking, reading. I would be just like my mother was, even though I hated it. But I would do that. 

Recording: (8428/ 9621) 
 Yeah. So that worked out. So I really hadn't dated for a long time and then I started dating again. And what's weird is you almost go right back in to the patterns because you're so scared you're going to be alone. You see yourself going I can be with this person and you know in your head this person's not for you. And then luckily indirectly I met my husband. 

Recording: (8429/ 9621) 
 You probably see it better now. Not that photo. Not that one. But yeah, it's just certain things make person themselves. 

Recording: (8430/ 9621) 
 And I said, you know, I don't know why you are insecure. I said, everything you do, you do well. I said, I try things and just bomb at them. And I said, you just zip through them. And I said, maybe someday when you're older, you'll look back and go, oh, I see what dad was talking about. But she just can't see that. 

Recording: (8431/ 9621) 
 If you are determined to having too much stress by your doctor, then the government will pay for a vacation for you. 

Recording: (8432/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8433/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (8434/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (8435/ 9621) 
 Just the number of people that were here. 

Recording: (8436/ 9621) 
 Yes, but that's great though. 

Recording: (8437/ 9621) 
 I mean, there's nothing bad about them or anything that they... 

Recording: (8438/ 9621) 
 Well, see, he moved into an apartment over on 11th Avenue. 

Recording: (8439/ 9621) 
 That's okay. I'm being Indiana. 

Recording: (8440/ 9621) 
 And I mean, I know I didn't think that much about it. Oh, well, I'm not doing anything else. Why not? And I mean, I don't, it seems kind of silly to legally have two levels. I mean, either you're going to do it the hard way or you're not. 

Recording: (8441/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8442/ 9621) 
 And these kids that are violent, your whole society is violent. I got, okay, I just got done helping my sister-in-law. That's an example right there. She's got five kids. She's on welfare. Her husband is Arab, right? 

Recording: (8443/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8444/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (8445/ 9621) 
 It's kind of like a... 

Recording: (8446/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (8447/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (8448/ 9621) 
 It's a lot of the, it looks, look and feel is a lot the same. 

Recording: (8449/ 9621) 
 the electric shock things. 

Recording: (8450/ 9621) 
 for about 17 or 18 years and just reached the point where I had enough of it and I didn't want anything about it. 

Recording: (8451/ 9621) 
 We're in the same age, right? 

Recording: (8452/ 9621) 
 I really didn't because I felt like I was in love with these boys. Yeah. 

Recording: (8453/ 9621) 
 And the high explosive shells had 37 pounds of TNT in them. So they'd make quite a bang when they went off. 

Recording: (8454/ 9621) 
 that you really didn't need, because then you get more bang for your bucks. 

Recording: (8455/ 9621) 
 Thank you. 

Recording: (8456/ 9621) 
 that's good no not really actually some I have and then I've run into the people that just like anything they want to get out of their hometown they don't like it they complain but normally I find that those people aren't taking advantage of the you know free art shows and you know I mean the things that are free I'm like oh have you done this no I didn't even know about it you've lived here all your life and I've only lived here X number of years and 

Recording: (8457/ 9621) 
 at each other's throat for this, that, and the other. And, you know, Devin is with my daughters, and wouldn't really get put in the middle of it, you know. And probably it was a blessing that they moved to St. Louis, because there probably could have been more problems, legal problems, you know, as far as going back and forth to court and putting her on a witness stand for stupid stuff, you know. So, in hindsight, it was kind of a blessing that they moved there. 

Recording: (8458/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that blocks out all that extraneous stuff that's trying to pull you away. 

Recording: (8459/ 9621) 
 I don't have money and when I start dating people, I have extremely expensive tastes for women. And I like wine and dining people. I love the opera and that gets real expensive after a while. It gets real expensive after a while. I'm taking one class. I'm taking an accounting class. I had a real big mess academically. Graduated high school with a 3.5. It was all college prep classes, AP courses. I got a really high IQ, extremely intelligent. All through high school I was just coasting on that intellect. I'd go in, take an exam, bing bang, go out, get an A. I wouldn't even study for it. I think I studied as much my senior year as I did my freshman year for one midterm or one final. And that just didn't work when I got to college. But I didn't know that until I was done with my freshman year with a 1.7 GPA. About, let's say the middle of winter quarter, I realized why I was in engineering. I had applied to three colleges in my senior year of high school. Ohio State, on a whim from my dad, who told me to apply there because I could get in without any trouble whatsoever. Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy. Now, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, and West Point are three of the top ten hardest schools in the world to get into. You get into one of those academies and you're coming out as an engineer. That's what they all are. I mean, yeah, there's other fields, but the vast majority are engineers. get in an honors engineering program called the Gateway Program. Engineering is the hardest field to study aside probably from law or medicine. And I went into the honors program. That was a big mistake, really, really big mistake. I got to college and it just went downhill. I had all that freedom and I had no clue how to study and it just went to hell in a handbasket. Summer, spring quarter, I switched my major to music because I'm extremely musically inclined. It's one of the gifts that I've gotten. And that I discovered is very similar to acting, which I love to do, but I realized that just like acting, you are all good, 95% of you are poor as dirt, 3% of you are right in the middle, and 2% of you are extremely wealthy. And the vast majority, like I said, 95% are dirt poor. I don't want to do that. My dad's a doctor. I was raised in high society. I don't want to leave high society. I like it there. I like it there a lot. So I was like, hey, I better get out of the music thing. So I decided to go into business. But I can't get into business until I get a bunch of prerequisite courses out of the way because my GPA is on, after this quarter, I I did really good this quarter after this quarter. It's up to a 2-2 and I'm not going to be able to get into the business school until I got a bunch of prerequisites out of the way and their sequences I Can't take counting to 12 until I'm done with 211 I can't take say I asked 200 and 201 until I'm done with 200 and all that junk. So I had to take this stupid class this summer because if I'm going to get in when I want to, I have to take it this summer. I hate taking classes in the summer. Because I'd rather just work and not worry about the classes and then have all sorts of fun all summer long with what my impression is that that's what I'm doing this summer. I'm still searching for a job I Would have I would have done some more searching today, but I've had a few problems with my satanic computer stupid 

Recording: (8460/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it would be just one more thing. 

Recording: (8461/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8462/ 9621) 
 I don't know. 

Recording: (8463/ 9621) 
 Yeah, no problem. 

Recording: (8464/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (8465/ 9621) 
 I don't have a good opinion of Columbus schools at all. No, not at all. 

Recording: (8466/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8467/ 9621) 
 Oh, it's horrible. It was horrible because you watch it and you think, oh my God. 

Recording: (8468/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's what I mean, they go by your age too. 

Recording: (8469/ 9621) 
 just because it's been three weeks now, you know. And not only that, there's something in the deal, like they lose their benefits after two weeks and the union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss. 

Recording: (8470/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8471/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. It's kind of frustrating, but I'm I it's a good it's probably good for me because I'm so it's hard for me to Just sit back and let other people Believe whatever they want to believe, you know, I just want to convince them, but I can't do that. So it's a good exercise for me I look at it that way and just letting them go ahead and 

Recording: (8472/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8473/ 9621) 
 I don't have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you. I just noticed that it continued to decline all through high school. And I was like, you should get out before you actually fail the class. And it was just unpleasant. I think I was stupid. I think that's what it amounts to. Not that I was not able to pick up the data. I was just unwise in whether or not it was worthwhile. And I believe that it's horribly worthwhile now. And yet now I'm not taking classes. 

Recording: (8474/ 9621) 
 to deal with. 

Recording: (8475/ 9621) 
 I mean, the way I grew up is probably like back in the day, like Catholics against the Columbus publics, you know, like the richies against the poories. That's how I kind of see it. But when I went to Northland, people think Northland's like a rich school. But the way I see it is, no, not really. I mean, we do live in a big, you know, housed area. You know, the houses are like huge. is school overdosed a kid on like some, I think it was a drug to calm him down so he's not so hyper and they like overdosed him like twice in a day and then when he goes home his mom's even overdosing him because they're overdosing him. 

Recording: (8476/ 9621) 
 And we monitor what they watch television-wise. We do a lot of library things, get them to the library a couple days a week, try to keep them interested in books. 

Recording: (8477/ 9621) 
 Sure. 

Recording: (8478/ 9621) 
 Yeah, oh yeah, the five-year-old just after the whole time, the minute she walks in the door, you know. 

Recording: (8479/ 9621) 
 Yeah, the Brady Bill didn't really do it for America like they thought. I mean, yeah, you wait five days, big deal. Go out on 20th Avenue and pick one up in five minutes. I've seen all kinds of people carry guns that shouldn't. 

Recording: (8480/ 9621) 
 but eventually went away. I just, I just, cause I would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy, you know. 

Recording: (8481/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (8482/ 9621) 
 And it was nice just seeing that. And you could tell they were still in love and everything. And you know, one of them had four children, one had like six. You know, I mean, it was amazing because I thought, well, I bet they're not still married. Getting right out of high school, I just wasn't interested in that when I was in high school at all. You know, I was ready to go out into the world. And these girls that get married so young, they just have no clue about life. 

Recording: (8483/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (8484/ 9621) 
 I delivered the Columbus dispatch in the morning too, so. 

Recording: (8485/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8486/ 9621) 
 He sure was. 

Recording: (8487/ 9621) 
 very often. I mean, maybe like there's like one or two that come during the year. 

Recording: (8488/ 9621) 
 Oh, yes. Yes. 

Recording: (8489/ 9621) 
 We were talking about this at work one day and I said, you know, I'm surprised you think that way because I tend to be a little left of center on most things, sometimes far left. And I said, now this isn't, she said, it seems like that would be the conservative view. In my opinion, the conservative view is they don't want to go back to Cuba, not to the communists. But people I've talked to, even extreme conservatives and liberals, they all pretty much feel the same way. They're the ones I've talked, I haven't heard anybody 

Recording: (8490/ 9621) 
 And my youngest daughter, when I was cramming about, because I talked to them, and they said, well, we're coming to Ohio in a couple weeks. And I said, oh, good. Are you going to come and see us? Well, no, we weren't planning that. And I said, well, why? Well, we're not driving. Dodie's renting us the car. Well, all that meant was my sister was renting the car, but he was driving the car. I said, well, then how are you going to get to these other places? And normally I wouldn't do that. I would just let it go. Well, Dodie's riding that car and I said, well, aren't you driving it? Well, yeah, but, and I said, fine. I don't even want to think about it. So it's kind of like 

Recording: (8491/ 9621) 
 I believe that's where it was originally set up. 

Recording: (8492/ 9621) 
 Well, I'm not the mayor or anything so I'm not gonna make any promises. 

Recording: (8493/ 9621) 
 Am I gonna vote for? 

Recording: (8494/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8495/ 9621) 
 He's like this robot. 

Recording: (8496/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm at the end of it all. 

Recording: (8497/ 9621) 
 But then it's like some evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle. And then you go, you can't stop and not watch that, you know? And if I was in charge of it, I'd cut some of it out. It's not that important. 

Recording: (8498/ 9621) 
 Oh, probably my family. My kids are here. I have a grandchild now. So yeah, I like to stay close to all them. 

Recording: (8499/ 9621) 
 Why don't you do that for a year? And not do it for a year, just go down for the day and then come back to Upper Arlington at night and live. How do you like to do that? 

Recording: (8500/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8501/ 9621) 
 very slow, very methodical. We take them to dog, my husband's taken them many times for when they had to have cataract operations, you know, so he's involved with the girls too. 

Recording: (8502/ 9621) 
 I don't know. That's so controversial. I mean, I mean to the point, I mean, they show them how to put condoms on bananas in public schools and it's like, well, are you promoting sex then? Or should do I? 

Recording: (8503/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8504/ 9621) 
 Well, like, I'm a philosophy minor, so if you look at different ethical theories and stuff, there's a hierarchy, kind of. This is what I've found. There's a hierarchy of things that are, like the inalienable rights, for instance. If you come into my house and rob me and then run outside, to kill you my property, like, there's a hierarchy there. For stealing another life, that's why people say, oh, you can do it, so, but I really feel like there's nothing, like, if it's inalienable, the definition is it's not able to be taken, not even by yourself, that's why you can't commit suicide. And since it's the highest thing, because without it, you can't even do the other, so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others, because without that, you can't commit suicide. And since it's the highest thing, because without it you can't even do the other, so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others, because without that you can't do the, you can't be ethical in any other way. So that has to be the highest thing. And if it's inalienable, because I didn't give it to you, I can't take it back. You never forfeited that, you never gave me that right. So that's why I feel like I could never want that to kill another person. 

Recording: (8505/ 9621) 
 But it kind of helps, actually, because you have all the people in there who are not honors, and they don't know how to, like the partiers, they don't know how to study or anything. 

Recording: (8506/ 9621) 
 Oh, I see. 

Recording: (8507/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8508/ 9621) 
 I have a friend in New Jersey, or two friends, a married couple. She's a lifelong Democrat. He's been a lifelong Republican. And there's always interesting discussions when I go to visit. And I went to visit them a few weeks before Clinton was formally impeached last year. And I just decided I wasn't going to bring it up. 

Recording: (8509/ 9621) 
 Only with her, those students who are high achievers, who are very bright, talented, maybe truly gifted, who are willing to jump through the hoops. 

Recording: (8510/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (8511/ 9621) 
 right in there. 

Recording: (8512/ 9621) 
 It's not Monroe County. Is it Monroe? Okay, okay. 

Recording: (8513/ 9621) 
 I don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything like that. But as far as morals and the right thing to do in life and what's out there, most kids know what the wrong thing is. 

Recording: (8514/ 9621) 
 short essay for a test. But the way that I would grade those would be pretty scientific, I think. I'd come up with a rubric, and I would say, you need to mention certain things, and I'll give certain points for your mentioning certain things. Yeah. I've never been a teacher who's had to assign or grade creative writing. I'm not sure I would know how to do that. Yeah. 

Recording: (8515/ 9621) 
 She's bit. 

Recording: (8516/ 9621) 
 Well, I told him, you know, I said, something we told you you were not to do. 

Recording: (8517/ 9621) 
 Or just thousands is enough. He didn't have to have millions. 

Recording: (8518/ 9621) 
 Mmm. Well that bathroom's starting to sound good right about now. 

Recording: (8519/ 9621) 
 Town with a Channel 

Recording: (8520/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I did too, man. 

Recording: (8521/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8522/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (8523/ 9621) 
 people call up and they have no idea what they want it's like why did you do this like why did you do this to me? They'll call up and they'll be like yeah I'm thinking about getting a blanket like what do you think about those? And like it's real funny when people ask me my opinion like on things like this like it's funny when people call up who are close to our age too it's funny to hear 

Recording: (8524/ 9621) 
 Which I, she said that and I said. 

Recording: (8525/ 9621) 
 He's probably been married for four or five years. 

Recording: (8526/ 9621) 
 Yeah, most of them. 

Recording: (8527/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8528/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (8529/ 9621) 
 Oh, what does it mean? Well, instead of going to your classroom, you go into a room where you sit and the teacher gives you all your work for the day and you can't talk or anything. 

Recording: (8530/ 9621) 
 I'm guessing. 

Recording: (8531/ 9621) 
 I had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted to know what I did for a living and I told them, I said, well, we're done. 

Recording: (8532/ 9621) 
 Just because you sin doesn't mean you're going to hell. 

Recording: (8533/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8534/ 9621) 
 And just because you're, I mean, I wasn't really an athletic, I did play sports when I was in high school, but I would dance or wasn't any good, you know, just like other guys, but whether I did or whether I didn't, you know, I don't, I don't, nobody picked on me. I mean, one time I got into it with one of the centers in football, you know, a big old guy, and I was still about the same size, but, 

Recording: (8535/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. I'm not married. I'm single. 

Recording: (8536/ 9621) 
 Yeah, exactly, I know. 

Recording: (8537/ 9621) 
 Well, I suppose. Well, I decided that I was going to date a black guy and my dad didn't like that at all. So he disowned me. And so now I'm married to my husband and 

Recording: (8538/ 9621) 
 But with kids in there, just so much more active at an early age. 

Recording: (8539/ 9621) 
 Do you know a group called Midnight Oil? Yeah. They're pretty good. I like them. Yeah. 

Recording: (8540/ 9621) 
 And I think that's a good sign, but I think there's a huge, there's millions of children that don't have any healthcare and that's not right. There's a lot of, between the lower and the upper, there's a huge disparity, but at least it's a step in the right direction. We have a nice solid middle income base, I think, because a lot of countries only have the, like I visited Mexico and it seems like they only had the distinction between The upper and lower I mean their middle class is very small and that but that economy is coming along too, and I mean it It'll be it's developing itself, which is which was nice. I took a tour of a plant down there Because my my old man had business down there So I went down just to see it and like it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day but they get they get bused into work because none of them have cars and then on top of that they all get a meal because they're like like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because I was talking to the one of the managers and he said if we don't do that then they won't be thinking about our quality and they'll be thinking about getting food and they'll be hungry so it hurts our quality so for them it was worth it and I think 

Recording: (8541/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8542/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8543/ 9621) 
 Well, like I said before, I think screening would be very difficult, especially because at that age you're going to have a lot of people who are, you know, people say things to say things and to get a reaction and to tell their friends that they said, I mean, you know, they can play off whatever and unless they were, you know, 

Recording: (8544/ 9621) 
 I don't know that they would use the information that they had it. I don't know. 

Recording: (8545/ 9621) 
 I mean, no crash or anything, but was rather scared, kind of shaken up by it. But no, they're very, very serious about designated drivers. 

Recording: (8546/ 9621) 
 Well, most people think it's something they rely on, like, well, the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools. On that issue, then, yeah, I agree with the gambling thing. Just as long as it's like social drinking, in a sense. Because if you have people just go out, like today, I bought a $1 lottery ticket won two bucks off of it so I kept my $1 and got a $1 ad and on yeah there's and then then there's these um a little bit more expensive cards you buy the Lottery cards one of them is called battleship that I've won a lot of money off of 

Recording: (8547/ 9621) 
 Didn't hear about that. 

Recording: (8548/ 9621) 
 and work later then, which was fine by me. Or he'd call and he'd say, is it okay if I work a little late tonight? Would you care if I stayed here a couple more hours? Which I think is really nice. There are a lot of men that 

Recording: (8549/ 9621) 
 Oh, gosh, that's really going around a lot. 

Recording: (8550/ 9621) 
 He always says. 

Recording: (8551/ 9621) 
 They set different rules up? Fine! Give me two more minutes to play. 

Recording: (8552/ 9621) 
 It's a little farther. 

Recording: (8553/ 9621) 
 Yeah, true. So are you obviously computer literate? Yes. Is your roommate helping you with this? No, actually my roommate's in Colorado right now and he's going to be there 

Recording: (8554/ 9621) 
 Not at that time. 

Recording: (8555/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I know. 

Recording: (8556/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8557/ 9621) 
 Um, actually it's more, it's almost actually turned into like a self business. Like I said, it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what I was doing. I'd tell them, they'd be like, Oh, I have some things around the house that need to be done. And so I'd go there and they'd tell people and 

Recording: (8558/ 9621) 
 teachers, a couple teachers decide to take a bunch of kids. Every couple years they go to different countries. 

Recording: (8559/ 9621) 
 That would probably change my decision a little bit. 

Recording: (8560/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah. 

Recording: (8561/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (8562/ 9621) 
 and they fly checks. Like if you write a check today and you deposit it in the bank, well that check has to go from your bank to clearing house. And that's all they do all night long. 

Recording: (8563/ 9621) 
 You're grounded. 

Recording: (8564/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so basically I learned with him. Y'all have to go do this, do that. 

Recording: (8565/ 9621) 
 A little geography wouldn't hurt. 

Recording: (8566/ 9621) 
 That's her job is to spoil them. So the poor things have the belly hanging on the ground. 

Recording: (8567/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, and you know what, I cook meat for my husband. I really don't cook red meat because he's on the road with his job and I know he stops at fast food places. But I cook him chicken and pork and I make soups, a lot of good soups for him with meat. And it really doesn't bother me to cook it. You know, I'm not going to sit home and make it roast every night. 

Recording: (8568/ 9621) 
 I've already learned an immense amount looking at your URL thing. Okay, so Belgium is a... 

Recording: (8569/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8570/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8571/ 9621) 
 Yeah she just likes to write stories and she's real creative that way. 

Recording: (8572/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. It'd be good though, because I could take care of the books and everything and do all that kind of thing. 

Recording: (8573/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

 no painting was needed. Well then as a result they went through and decided since I broke the lease to you know get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they scratched out the first rating and changed it to a lower rating. And even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate 

Recording: (8575/ 9621) 
 Oh well, that's unfortunate. 

Recording: (8576/ 9621) 
 Oh, they do in ninth grade. And by 10th grade and 11th, they're a little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they're going to have to go to college. And this is like the only life they're going to get. They kind of get that realization. They start getting serious. Kids at middle school think everything's just a big joke. I'm going to play in a rock band. They all think they're going to be rock stars and drummers. And they could care less about anything. It hasn't hit them yet. This is my real life. Duh. This is my one real life. Better not throw it away. They waste time. They lose stuff. 

Recording: (8577/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and everybody's gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with. So, you know. And unfortunately, as that guy, this guy in particular, he was a center for the football team as he grew up older, you know. He realized that he wasn't as big as important as he, he blew out his knee for OU, you know. But I went to school with Larry Hunter, who's the basketball coach for OU now. And he had the same thing happen to him. He had a scholarship for OU, and both of his knees were shot and everything. And he was a good ball player, probably one of the best ones I've ever seen, and rivaled Larry Bird back in that day and everything and but one heck of a nice guy you know never let it get to him. 

Recording: (8578/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and like, I don't know, that state's notorious for killing people. I think they killed someone last night. 

Recording: (8579/ 9621) 
 I think the people who have already graduated there, like the doctors and the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation among adults. It's just that the kids want to go. It's just thought of as a somewhat party school. 

Recording: (8580/ 9621) 
 But I do believe if you know when you're in love and you love somebody you will not you will not cheat on them.

 Aww.

 that I wanted them to file charges on him. And they said, well, no, he's not met the criteria. I said, well, he doesn't get to school sometimes till lunchtime. They said, well, he gets here just in time to not be counted tardy, or not tardy, but 

Recording: (8583/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8584/ 9621) 
 You don't realize it. 

Recording: (8585/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's why that was your question. Are we going to have doom? We're going to have a catastrophe. We're going to get this thing turned around before we have. Yes, I think we will. But I don't think we're ready to turn around yet. I think we're still in this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four or five times. It is coming upon us so rapidly. I strongly predict that in just 20 years and possibly 10, each and every one of us in the world are going to be interconnected with one another. But once again, it's an impersonal interconnection. I'll be able to contact you when you're over in Paris and I'll be over in Octi, Ohio and out there on the farm. And I'm probably watching the geese swimming up and down the little lake. And you're sitting over there in Paris having a coffee something, something. Yeah, it does.

 I've been here all my life. Right now I don't do anything. I had a head injury in 93 where I got hit with a hockey puck in the head at a chill hockey game.

 Amazing.

 uh... uh... there they were alright uh... at their columbus sally from columbus if you know she is uh... 

Recording: (8590/ 9621) 
 I grew up in Massillon, Ohio. I'm the oldest of five children. I have four children of my own. I was married many years ago, and then I've been married to my husband now for 21 years. And we have three children together. So I have a daughter, 28, a daughter, 19, who's a sophomore at Ohio Wesleyan. My older daughter's a graduate from Ohio. I'm a graduate of Ohio. I have a son who's nine. Let's see, Joe is 15. He's a sophomore at high school and I have an eighth grade daughter at. And I'm a homemaker. I have a degree in sociology. I've been at home since my second daughter was born with my second marriage. And I consider it a luxury and a privilege and I just absolutely love being at home. I do a lot of volunteer work. I'm real involved with the school system with Columbus Public and I like organizing big projects for them. My husband's director of engineering for Liebert. And so that's why I know what you're saying. Whenever I complain about the weather in Columbus, he always says, well, go anywhere you want. Where would you like to live? Oh, I want to stay here. I don't want to go anywhere yet until all my kids are ready. And then my daughters always say, OK, mom, as soon as we're all done with school, then we can all move to California. But we have to go as a group, because I'm real, real close to my children. 

Recording: (8591/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's not like... There is a face behind the music, but not so much too. It's not like...

 Some of them transfer from up north and out east and Indiana and just different walks of life. 

Recording: (8594/ 9621) 
 And I just can't imagine, I had dogs and cats, we did, and I loved it. And I just think kids need that, and it's just a different kind of love. I think, you know, they learn from it. 

Recording: (8595/ 9621) 
 Probably would have been about six years ago. I ran in sixth or seventh grade. 

Recording: (8596/ 9621) 
 I did have a part-time job. I loved it. It was just four hours a day, but they wanted me to go full-time, and I just didn't feel like I wanted to go full-time. I was working as a receptionist and answering the phone, doing some light filing, just a variety of tasks, office-type tasks, and I really liked it. I liked the hours, but I didn't want to go eight hours compared to four, so I left. 

Recording: (8597/ 9621) 
 and it's it's one color text no pictures to always ask you what things look like and you don't can tell him and to it's like the computers are all screwed up like you type in you know like type in computers and i'll say we don't have a more we obviously do and like the new look at a different way you'll be able to find like it's uh... that's really really got a stand 

Recording: (8598/ 9621) 
 Are you sure? 

Recording: (8599/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (8600/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8601/ 9621) 
 I think there's a heck of a lot more to it than what we'll probably ever know. They really haven't checked into the background of the parents as to what their beliefs were and everything. And I think that's a shame because you mentioned it before about something accidentally happening where some kid shoots another kid and the parents are responsible for it and everything. These two kids deliberately went in to kill. And they wanted to kill more than what they killed. Then they killed themselves, so we'll never know from their end point why they did it. But I think there's gotta be something that we can find out from their parents as to how they live, you know, they could have been Anything yeah, they could have been down and it could have been making him making him do it, you know 

Recording: (8602/ 9621) 
 I'm from here, Columbus, Ohio. 

Recording: (8603/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8604/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8605/ 9621) 
 You're right. 

Recording: (8606/ 9621) 
 I think it should be the parents responsibility. But I have no objection to them teaching it somewhat in the schools I guess. 

Recording: (8607/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8608/ 9621) 
 Well, I mean... 

Recording: (8609/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I know, I know, I know. 

Recording: (8610/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

 He was a great advocate of old Woody, so he probably learned quite a bit from the old general. 

Recording: (8612/ 9621) 
 No. No. I really don't. I've done a variety of different things and then also just reading and things since I've been off. I wanted to go back to school. I thought about that. I want to do something with kids. I almost thought of opening my own daycare center, but then I didn't know if I wanted to get into that. 

Recording: (8613/ 9621) 
 I his wife's a teacher and I understand an excellent teacher. So I think he has real good information that he works with. Well I think she maybe retired last year but she had taught Columbus for 20 years or something like that. And so I think his information is good but I guess the way he handles things sometimes gets through to people.

 product certain things, but they want everything to be the same. It can't be. They can't be the same. It's just a natural thing. But the thing is, let them do what they can. That's a God-given talent, what you have there. Can I nurse? And how many refuse to nurse voluntarily if they have children? Why? Talk among your women folk. Why do you have, well, I don't want to. You have the natural ability to give all the natural protein, the immunization things out of that maternal milk. Why can't you instead of getting off the shelf?

 It's so dirty. I wish they'd clean it up more. When I first started working for the courier service, I really, really hated one-way streets.

You just floor it and fly right through the middle of downtown. Improvements, I would just say, I would just say, I mean, this place is dirty. 

Recording: (8629/ 9621) 
 So I'm taking it in high school. 

Recording: (8630/ 9621)

Recording: (8634/ 9621) 
 We had a little gallery, we were in Clintonville for a year or so, and then we moved to Grandview. It was just fine art, we call it fine art crafts, and it was handmade stuff from local people. We had a lot of jewelry, pottery, silk, and paintings, that kind of stuff. 

Recording: (8635/ 9621) 
 You know, he says that E equals MC squared. I say it's E equals MC cubed because the world is three dimensional. It's not two dimensional. Two dimensional limits, everything. But you look at his theory of relativity, all of our mathematical theorems, physical theorems on physics and things of that nature have been based off that. 

Recording: (8636/ 9621) 
 No, I think we're only friends inside the class. I mean, a lot of them I've known from middle school and following them up and you know, they just all go their different ways. Like the one girl I was friends with at Willow Park, I mean she was a grade lower than me but when we'd seen each other in the halls like, hey what's up? And we'd talk and you know, what's going on and we're doing this after school and that. In high school. I didn't know anything. I know she was bad and that was it. 

Recording: (8637/ 9621) 
 No, that's okay. I just don't want to touch it. 

Recording: (8638/ 9621) 
 It was just like that, I'm telling you it was. And we would see, you know, they would put things on the screen for us to watch. I mean, I learned a lot of stuff. It was a very good experience I went through. Very good. 

Recording: (8639/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't really like the, I don't, I really don't like that job, but, you know, I like the people there, but it's like way too busy, I think. 

Recording: (8640/ 9621) 
 The baby is due May 30th and graduation is June 2nd. 

Recording: (8641/ 9621) 
 The two girls who used to live across the street from me were gay. They're still real good friends of mine. They live down in Circleville. The guy across the street's gay. I worked in a gay bar one time. I was the only straight person in there. Every girl that walked in there, she'd come right to me. No offense. 

Recording: (8642/ 9621) 
 That would be good. 

Recording: (8643/ 9621) 
 I'm not going to do it. 

Recording: (8644/ 9621) 
 Oh, I don't really think so. I think of myself as kind of an impatient person, but I guess I don't get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do. And I don't yell and scream at them. I mean, I realize they didn't ask to have a learning disability. I mean, and they can't. Some teachers think they're just being belligerent, and if they want to straighten up, they could. And what I try to tell those teachers is they can't change their learning disability anymore, you can change your brown eyes. You know, they were born with it, it's genetic, someone else in their family has it. They can learn, they just don't learn the same way everybody else does. You have to break it down into pieces or teach it a different way. It's like teaching a math problem two different ways, you get the same answer but one way works better for you. Well, that's how they are. You know, maybe they don't learn well by listening. Maybe they don't learn well by looking at a chart or something. Maybe they only learn well when they're up moving around, doing something. You know, you just have to understand that their avenues of learning are like different than yours. And totally, some of them might be totally screwed up. Like they might hear half of what you say. Or they might jumble up what you say and you say, turn to page 393 here. And they turn to 339 in their book. And they think they did what you said. It's just like something's mixed up between the actual eye and the ear and then where it gets interpreted into the brain, it gets all scrambled somehow. And I always tell teachers if you could just walk for one day in their shoes, you'd probably have a lot of empathy for them. 

Recording: (8645/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8646/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (8647/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8648/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8649/ 9621) 
 But they wouldn't, because my daughter was like a real bubbly, outgoing, you know, people person. And she got by with so much at school. But she's, you know, it's worked out fine with her, with both of them actually.

 It is unifying and I just wish, but I guess there's a rule out there, I've asked ABC News why they can't promote these, they show the roster, here's your grade point average engineering major, fine. Tell them what the majors are, tell them what these kids are, what do they plan on doing? They're not all gonna make it to the professionals. Then what do they do afterwards? They get token jobs because of their connections? 

Recording: (8655/ 9621) 
 I would say for the most part that that is not really true.

I'm like, after working with RNs, and we were doing the same things, basically, and they didn't get paid much more than I did. So I was like, well, what a waste, you know? Go to school for nothing, basically, just to learn a few more theories. I could come up with my own.

She's like, I miss you. I'm like, well, I miss you too. Not probably the way you miss me, but I miss you. She's a lunatic. No, no, no, no, no. I mean, she's a great person.

 How are they going to make sure that the lock is on a gun? I mean, that just seems like a waste of money to me. All you're doing is letting a company sell a trigger lock for a gun and make somebody have to buy one, but you're not going to make them put it on the gun.

 He's just disruptive. And he said, OK. A week later, she said, we didn't get any bad reports. Thank you. And she said, are you going to continue? I said, yeah, it's a lot easier. For the rest of the year, we got no bad reports from him. 

Recording: (8704/ 9621) 
 Oh, yeah, I haven't learned to stop myself too much yet. I think we have this thing of seeing logistics and efficiency and it's kind of like, okay, now let's see, if this is what has to happen, we're able to order the sequence instead of like, I see people doing things like, and that has to do with the driving thing too, like driving from place to place to place to place to place to place. Why the hell don't you call and find out if they even have it? 

Recording: (8705/ 9621) 
 I don't know, I kind of see Al Gore winning just because he's the most like... 

Recording: (8706/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8707/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't think there should be any more new developments just yet, just to kind of weed out a little bit of the population. Put one part of the population in this neighborhood and just pretty much divide it all so it's not too crowded one place and then not too vacant other places. 

Recording: (8708/ 9621) 
 that's accepted the cousin side yet. 

Recording: (8709/ 9621) 
 I should not... 

Recording: (8710/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8711/ 9621) 
 they do offer sex ed but it's you know very um scientific in nature and then we did have a um I think it was actually in religion class where they paired you up you were a couple and you had to go through budgets and chores and it was more that type of tasks 

Recording: (8712/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8713/ 9621) 
 here. 

Recording: (8714/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8715/ 9621) 
 And the way Disney sells, I think, is they do have beautiful music. 

Recording: (8716/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm looking for work, taking my time looking for work. It's the first chance I've had in probably 20 years to sit back and get what I want. So I'm doing that. Getting unemployment and taking my time. I've got several interviews, some exciting ones. 

Recording: (8717/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8718/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (8719/ 9621) 
 on a homestead. 

Recording: (8720/ 9621) 
 I enjoy traveling, I enjoy meeting people. When I go on these travel things I have to do it for business, I meet with the ships and so forth, go back behind. But then when I go to the ports, the companies pretty much know what they contract with. So I like to meet with the people there, the Gestapo, so I'll talk with them and learn more about their little things. Just like down in St. Croix last year, I spent two hours talking to the security there and they said, boy, there's something wrong with you guys from the Continentals. I said, Continental? That's what we call you guys from the States. 

Recording: (8721/ 9621) 
 About once a week my wife sees her usually more than me 

Recording: (8722/ 9621) 
 Right, right, that's right. Yeah. So that was an interesting and when we went to church up Hamilton and over to and on Morse or up New Albany Road to Morse and over to High Street, none of that commercial stuff was out there on Morse Road. I don't know if you know Morse Road very well, but there's out by Carl, there's shopping center after shopping center after shopping center, after housing development. But when we did this in the mid 60s, when we drove up that way in the early 60s, there were fields, there were farms, there were forests, none of that stuff out there. And it's just amazing, the urban sprawl that's taken over out there. 

Recording: (8723/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (8724/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (8725/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm right there 

Recording: (8726/ 9621) 
 you know, to get a $4 or $5 a year tax cut. 

Recording: (8727/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8728/ 9621) 
 It should be important, but the students that are at the other end need the help too. A lot of people think if you have a child that's gifted that all your problems are solved. It's not. It's a different set of problems. There's personality quirks that go with that, emotional issues. 

Recording: (8729/ 9621) 
 I'll raise them the best way I can. 

Recording: (8730/ 9621) 
 During the Depression, my grandfather moved over here and then asked her 

Recording: (8731/ 9621) 
 ready willing to do that again. 

Recording: (8732/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (8733/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's like the woman that used to live in the apartment where we lived before us. See, she had a husband that she was married to for quite some time. He got on Ohio's number one DUI list with 18 DUIs. Man, can you imagine how much money he's put into that? I mean, you'd think your first DUI offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and weekend in jail or something. But 18 of them and you're racking up all that money and all those legal bills and all that time. I think he is in jail now. 

Recording: (8734/ 9621) 
 Civil rights, well I take the extreme position that civil rights are an illusion. Yeah, they're on paper, which is a good thing, because it was a terrible thing when there were laws that restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender. But I think in many ways it has had little effect on creating an equal and fair society. Maybe some of my leftist positions will come out right now. People have the freedom, but I believe that based upon where in the social stratum you are born in the United States, you have a limited ability to move upward. And that these class, I don't want to say class lines because that has so many historical connotations, because it's not the exact same as say class was in the Marxist sense, but class lines still today very much Follow race lines and What good is Like knowing that you have the freedom to vote when you know painfully well that you are not going to be able to get a job that's gonna buy a house for your family and let them live in relative comfort. I mean, in real terms, in things I think are valuable to the individual. 

Recording: (8735/ 9621) 
 Yeah, for everybody. So it's kind of a really big deal. And my parents are the oldest from their families too. So it's a first great grandchild. And with my husband, he is the oldest. So for everybody. 

Recording: (8736/ 9621) 
 I don't know where I'm going to find you, honestly, I'm thinking of doing a career flight. 

Recording: (8737/ 9621) 
 So, yeah. 

Recording: (8738/ 9621) 
 Or limited, very limited. 

Recording: (8739/ 9621) 
 It's an island, but a planet together. I liked it there. I kind of like it, and I figure they'll probably hook up, but I don't like how the show, this show, and this happened with Deep Space Nine, too, and even with Next Generation for a little bit, how the shows become soap opera-like. I mean, the romantic aspects of the stories don't really appeal to me very much. I'm more interested in the social things than good old special effects. But I think I like that, how it's kept with a sort of tension and it's not like, they're not completely thrown together like B'Elanna and Tom, which I don't like that at all. 

Recording: (8740/ 9621) 
 better than that much dirt. So whenever we heard any firing like it was coming toward us, we'd head for that hole. 

Recording: (8741/ 9621) 
 I have a five hour course the first term of summer quarter. 

Recording: (8742/ 9621) 
 Yes, yes, you might make millions. You could retire young. Really. 

Recording: (8743/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (8744/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8745/ 9621) 
 I didn't know that. 

Recording: (8746/ 9621) 
 Totally left that part out. No one felt me in about no throwing up or anything. That really made me mad. 

Recording: (8747/ 9621) 
 I just think it's a different time now. I don't think, I think everybody's living more for today and talking about the future, you know, hoping that the future's there. I think there's a quote unquote end time aspect to life, you know. 

Recording: (8748/ 9621) 
 You know now. 

Recording: (8749/ 9621) 
 Okay, good. 

Recording: (8750/ 9621) 
 Trying to cram organic into my head 

Recording: (8751/ 9621) 
 What did you spend most of your time doing besides snorkeling? 

Recording: (8752/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8753/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8754/ 9621) 
 But you understand what I'm saying. You're going to have to make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal. 

Recording: (8755/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8756/ 9621) 
 Right, right. And again, if it's criminal activity, you want somebody to stop it and know about it. But if it's, I'm not doing anything I want anybody to know about. And it wants to prevent them from going and finding out what some company's doing, what research is. That's a threat on the web too, is that you can connect into somebody's system and they don't know you're there and you can see what they're doing. If they're doing research, you know, developing a new product or something, you can, you know, that's corporate espionage. And I'm sure that's going on and I've heard cases of it. Yeah. Well, and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do, they'll find a way around. You know, nobody's found a way to prevent people from getting in. And people are real good about finding new ways to do it. 

Recording: (8757/ 9621) 
 but it's teaching him discipline, responsibility. You can't do these things at this time, you know. 

Recording: (8758/ 9621) 
 I'm sure it makes it easier, but I think that a person can establish a relationship. You just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship. And so I think that even if I were working, you know, with my oldest daughter, I worked, but I arranged my life around her so that even though I had that degree, I waited tables because when she was little, before she started school, I could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at 7.30, so I was with her all day. Then when she started school, I switched over to lunches, and so I've always arranged my life around my children, so I have an opportunity to be with them. 

Recording: (8759/ 9621) 
 Well, they were none of my friends that were pregnant, and I'm not sure they, you know, I just remember a couple girls that were pregnant. I don't, I wasn't friends with them, and I'm not sure about who their boyfriends were or anything like that. 

Recording: (8760/ 9621) 
 a building or some target that we could see. 

Recording: (8761/ 9621) 
 Yes, we're both, I've gotten kind of bad, but my husband's a marathon trainer. I try to run with her at least two to three times a week, because he's too fast for her. But we go to Hoffman Farms up in, off of Cosgrain, Hilliard, I'm not sure if it's in Hilliard, but we've taken her to the Scioto Park. 

Recording: (8762/ 9621) 
 My father moved here, yes. 

Recording: (8763/ 9621) 
 But the trouble is we don't fit the horse with the proper carriage load. And we need to do that in our society. We need to work as a team. There's no sense of having five guards on a basketball team. If you don't have a center, you can tip it off and rebound. 

Recording: (8764/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, they do. 

Recording: (8765/ 9621) 
 Well, it starts with allowing, Heather has two mommies. 

Recording: (8766/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think basically normal hours would be like 8 to 12 and then you go home during lunchtime because that's the big meal of the day. You go home and eat with your family. That's really important. 

Recording: (8767/ 9621) 
 It's just a rule. 

Recording: (8768/ 9621) 
 There was this one guy, had, I don't know how many, several herds of sheep, need to hire. I think they were Mexicans. 

Recording: (8769/ 9621) 
 So it's very part-time and I am a full-time student. So I was working somewhere else before, but I needed somewhere on campus. 

Recording: (8770/ 9621) 
 where she works and this is just OSU's breast cancer place. 

Recording: (8771/ 9621) 
 You just keep going. That's part of life. You pick up something, you learn it, and you keep going. 

Recording: (8772/ 9621) 
 Ain't no way. 

Recording: (8773/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8774/ 9621) 
 It doesn't have any words in it like exacerbate or undoubtedly, I'll tell you that. 

Recording: (8775/ 9621) 
 Yeah, across the street is the dental and the hospital. So people were really loud down there. 

Recording: (8776/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8777/ 9621) 
 Basically, they didn't legally adopt him or anything, but they're the ones that he considers his family, really. And I mean, he still keeps in contact with his mom and his dad, but it's always kind of a challenge for him. 

Recording: (8778/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8779/ 9621) 
 why are you doing it now? And then my youngest one, she likes to dress totally different. She's sort of like a little bit of a preppy. But she does not understand why people want to have like eyes out on their shirt or a name on their pants. And she says, I just think that's stupid. She says, you can buy nice clothes without that. So neither one of them pressured me. And the one thing that was really odd when they were little is we would go like to Toys R Us and up and down the rows. And I see kids it's like, you know, and they would walk over and pick something up and go and then put it back down and keep walking. And it's like, you know, I told Joyce, I says, you know, I feel like I'm an ogre because are they terrified to even ask for this stuff? And she goes, no, she says they don't't want it. She says, they just want to see what it's like. You know, because their favorite toy when they were little is I would go to, what do you call it? Lazy boy and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofas and the chairs and take a knife and cut doors in it. And they would play with that for weeks, you know, until somebody, one of their friends would come over and have a little accident. And then we go, well, we have to build a new house. But, you know, they just, reading and playing with stuff like that, they enjoyed, you know. 

Recording: (8780/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8781/ 9621) 
 So 

Recording: (8782/ 9621) 
 right? 

Recording: (8783/ 9621) 
 So I was like in shape very well. I was in very good shape. 

Recording: (8784/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8785/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8786/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha! 

Recording: (8787/ 9621) 
 So I mean basically my opinion on that is just leave it up to them. I mean if they want to take the risks obviously they know. 

Recording: (8788/ 9621) 
 No, they should talk about, I think they should talk about that too. I never did it and I wish I could have waited until I was married, but you're going through that, whatever you go through when you're a teenager, so you're like, so what? Well, most kids, I'm not, some kids still do that, but I think, yes, I do think they should put that in it also. 

Recording: (8789/ 9621) 
 I work at a company, plus I help out at the BVA, Vietnam Veterans Association. 

Recording: (8790/ 9621) 
 Yes and no. I mean, in high school it was a bunch of little things. Here it's not so much a lot of things. 

Recording: (8791/ 9621) 
 Ha ha. 

Recording: (8792/ 9621) 
 Everybody needs to know that information. For credit cards. 

Recording: (8793/ 9621) 
 I 

Recording: (8794/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (8795/ 9621) 
 Now, most of my paintings were completed before, like 1995, 1996, before it came back out. It was more of a thing, like images from my childhood coming back out, and now it's suddenly, you hear about it more often. So that's why I'm a little funny about, it used to be proud, like, I paint Star Wars. 

Recording: (8796/ 9621) 
 High on their horse, yeah. Some of them are, too. 

Recording: (8797/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I could imagine. 

Recording: (8798/ 9621) 
 I know, exactly. 

Recording: (8799/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (8800/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so they adjusted that, but then they didn't have any way to enforce that. 

Recording: (8801/ 9621) 
 Hopefully. 

Recording: (8802/ 9621) 
 No, I am definitely in favor of that. I mean, yes, the parent is supposed to do it, and one would hope that the parent would get there before the health class did, but if the parent isn't going to get there, it's the only way they're ever going to find out. 

Recording: (8803/ 9621) 
 That's where we figure in a few years he'll be fine. It's just getting there. It's been very difficult. I mean, there's times when we didn't know where he was for a week at a time. I was driving Lane Avenue once and saw him begging money on the street. It's a pretty heavy load to go through, it really is. 

Recording: (8804/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (8805/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (8806/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (8807/ 9621) 
 In the meantime, you know, you got to pay the bills. So, you know, I'm not sure what she wants to do. She's had so many different kinds of jobs, part-time jobs, though. You know, when she was younger, like 10 years ago, she wanted to have her own talk show. 

Recording: (8808/ 9621) 
 But with people coming back later and saying that they changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents, I'd be concerned about that. But that's not going to happen in this case, I don't think. And because of her age, and this makes no sense to me, the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for 72 hours before she can give it up for adoption. Because of her age, and it doesn't make sense to me. So they're talking to a social worker now to find out. They don't want to take the baby home because they're afraid of being too attached to it then. And they don't think it's a good atmosphere for it because her mother smokes constantly, her mother's alcoholic. 

Recording: (8809/ 9621) 
 because you do have to have a higher education most of the time to do anything these days. So they definitely have to have their 

Recording: (8810/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8811/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (8812/ 9621) 
 Actually, you can have, well they usually go together. Some kids have learning disabilities without the ADHD and some have ADHD without the learning disability and some have both. And you can have ADD without having the hyperactive part. You can have attention deficit disorder with what they call hypoactivity. And that's the student that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy and they never cause any trouble but they're kind of like out of touch with reality and they're always looking out the window and like the other one that says I didn't hear what was the question and they're ADD and they can't quite focus and distract, they can't screen out the distractions but because they're not hyper, they're not always doing this and they're not bothering people, they're kind of the, they're the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle. Those are the kids that are real cooperative and they're always smiling, they're kind of spaced out and daydreaming and it takes a long time to realize and this kid can't focus. But with the kid that's all over the place and doing the, tapping this kid's chair and the kid goes, make him stop tapping my chair. You know, you can see right away that he can't focus because when you're, he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he's like all over the place while you're explaining. He's not listening. You're trying to show him something. He won't look at it. You know, it's like people often say ADD kids can't focus or can't attend to anything, but what's really happening is they attend to everything. 

Recording: (8813/ 9621) 
 Five stars. What's your major? Needle pointing, finger paints, journalism, medicine, okay. Crosswords, okay. That gives our younger people some mentors to look after, doesn't it? And what are your scores in those? Oh, I'm just barely getting by passwords. But that's a problem. We've lacked the standards. No, that's their right. Keep it private. But no, I wish those guys would just spell, hey, I'm majoring in accounting, I'm majoring in finance, I'm majoring in business, and I got 3.5, I got 2.6. And whatever the criteria is to play on the team, why aren't you playing this week? Well, I'm practicing, I'm still required to practice even though I can't play this week. Why can't you play? It's a rule. What rule? Well, if I don't make certain things during the week, which is academic, I still have to perform sports-wise, make that commitment, but if I fall through in that, then I'm off the team, period. But those are things that need to be publicized more instead of saying, well, hey, we brought this much ticket gate this month, and you got this scores, and this percentage is that. We need to expand more on that so that the younger people have better role models to look at and not just playing round ball or the spiral. We need to get them out there and say, how are you going to perform in school? I'm sure Michael Red's got some mentors out there. You see guys wearing number five and whatever the number is, eight and whatever. Okay, there's a reason for it. But what's the other part of it? We don't do it because why? We don't want to bring it up. We don't want to bring some embarrassment possibly. But that's part of life. When they get out in the real world, I'm talking about these guys, some will be successful in terms of whomever and some will be successful in other people's eyes. But the thing is, show the kids that are watching them. Hey, there's more than just sports. Sports is a byproduct here at Ohio State. 

Recording: (8814/ 9621) 
 Nah. 

Recording: (8815/ 9621) 
 Crime is a lot worse now, you know, on the streets than it used to be. 

Recording: (8816/ 9621) 
 No, nothing at all. It was known that he was the father. Like I said, I mean, he was kind of just one of those kids. And I mean, he didn't listen to anyone or anything. And he ended up like running away from home basically, like I said, going out to Colorado. And like all he did was drive down there. His car broke down. His parents like wired him money for him to get a plane ticket to come back. And he ended up just taking the money, fixing his car with it, and kept on going. 

Recording: (8817/ 9621) 
 You know, just turn right out in front of you. Everybody's running red lights nowadays. I mean, which laws you gonna pick out to enforce and which laws ain't you? 

Recording: (8818/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (8819/ 9621) 
 The parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home, which was things like how to diaper your baby, whether you should leave them crying in their bassinet or crib, which I think is horrible, and I think it's good that they've come out with all these new studies that tell people not to do that. Let's see what else was there. 

Recording: (8820/ 9621) 
 the reds and Indians. 

Recording: (8821/ 9621) 
 It's 

Recording: (8822/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (8823/ 9621) 
 commitment, you know, can't just be your roommate. 

Recording: (8824/ 9621) 
 When else, at this point in my life, when else would I be able to do it? 

Recording: (8825/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8826/ 9621) 
 He didn't. 

Recording: (8827/ 9621) 
 Because I've always liked to fix up my own house. 

Recording: (8828/ 9621) 
 I love it. 

Recording: (8829/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8830/ 9621) 
 Not if he'd been as open about it as he was here. Clinton did that also and thought he'd be able to desegregate the military and fan out with his first action as president. There's a strong backlash against that, at least nationwide and in the military. But I thought it was the right stance. 

Recording: (8831/ 9621) 
 to 

Recording: (8832/ 9621) 
 Well, I know. And you know, when I think back about that week, it was just crazy because it was on a Saturday morning. She went into labor. So I was up all night Saturday and all day Sunday. I didn't get home till Sunday night. And then his brother from Vancouver, his daughter from Canada and his mom from Florida were staying with us and they were leaving that Tuesday. So. 

Recording: (8833/ 9621) 
 I wouldn't have been smiling from down there to up here when he dropped me off. He didn't even know. 

Recording: (8834/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8835/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I did. 

Recording: (8836/ 9621) 
 I had that with the parakeet I had before. Their lifespan in the wild is about five years, seven years in captivity, and he was 13. 

Recording: (8837/ 9621) 
 just from what he's learned. 

Recording: (8838/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (8839/ 9621) 
 So this boy, whatever he did, there's no doubt in my mind that he either heard internal voices or actual audible voices of spirits that were misguided spirits. 

Recording: (8840/ 9621) 
 She works at Franklin University. She's an assistant vice president there. 

Recording: (8841/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8842/ 9621) 
 द्याव 

Recording: (8843/ 9621) 
 to take care of him. I mean, for 12 years old, no offense. 

Recording: (8844/ 9621) 
 And maybe that's why it's like that. 

Recording: (8845/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you get to see all the different kinds. I think even if I don't want to go into it, rotations in every single area will be interesting. I shadowed in the psych ward last week, and that was really interesting. And I have a feeling I'm going to love my rotation, but I don't want to be a psychiatrist. 

Recording: (8846/ 9621) 
 looks like a spider web 

Recording: (8847/ 9621) 
 I had stuff in and there was a paper they used to send to parents of students. I think they stopped publishing that. I had stuff in that frequently. I've had some stuff in lately and I'm working on football stuff right now. 

Recording: (8848/ 9621) 
 Banking? Okay. 

Recording: (8849/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8850/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (8851/ 9621) 
 Oh, they do now. 

Recording: (8852/ 9621) 
 You know, there's not a store open for miles and you're out there and your stomach starts going, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr you 

Recording: (8853/ 9621) 
 you're gonna have to do something to get to the gameplay or whatever. 

Recording: (8854/ 9621) 
 most of my friends are, they act like kids. 

Recording: (8855/ 9621) 
 Sure. 

Recording: (8856/ 9621) 
 I don't even read it much. It's very conservative, very Republican. Yeah. 

Recording: (8857/ 9621) 
 You'd run around in three pairs of sweatsuits and a vinyl jumpsuit over that, under heaters. 

Recording: (8858/ 9621) 
 And then I would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure that they kept me there. But I think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable. I mean, I don't know. I've never done this before, so I can't really say. But I mean, my feeling is the least amount of time I have to be in the hospital, the happier I'm going to be. 

Recording: (8859/ 9621) 
 I can't even go out and sign that long. I've had melanoma, cancer and stuff. So I sold my boat. Now mainly my hobby is just tinkering around stuff. I'll buy a car, fix it up and sell it. 

Recording: (8860/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8861/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8862/ 9621) 
 in Germany. 

Recording: (8863/ 9621) 
 Well, that, yeah. 

Recording: (8864/ 9621) 
别 

Recording: (8865/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8866/ 9621) 
 Totally. 

Recording: (8867/ 9621) 
 I like to stay right around Columbus. 

Recording: (8868/ 9621) 
 I mean, that was— 

Recording: (8869/ 9621) 
 almost like an admission film where the family's living with the animals in the same house. And you try to understand. And you'll never, they'll never get away from poverty and the classes in our society. That's just life. We're always going to be that. But the thing is, try to have understanding and compassion for them and try to reach out. And sometimes people don't want it either. And sometimes you can say, well, now I know why they don't want it because they don't know they don't know how to handle it They appreciate the thought that goes a lot longer than just giving them that because of the given they don't do with it So I really I really think I Always say traveling People are all the same worldwide. They just give them different colors, different facial, different accents, so God can give them unique characteristics so he can call them his own. He knows each one of us. But we're all the same when we sit down talking about the emotions that drive you. And I keep asking, one thing to ask yourself and ask the business person, what would you be doing today if you were born in a third world country? How thankful are you that you're here and how do you show that thankfulness? 

Recording: (8870/ 9621) 
 No, they were from all over the world. I had one companion who was from Russia, but she was on a temporary mission. Mostly all over America, but there was a girl from Mongolia. There was girls there who I never was companions with them, but they were from Russia. There was a girl from Moscow. My mission president was actually from St. Petersburg and his wife, they didn't speak English. 

Recording: (8871/ 9621) 
 They have honors classes which are separate and they're supposed to be with better faculty and smaller class size and a little more challenging. 

Recording: (8872/ 9621) 
 I had a social worker, you know, the whole time. They might, you know, do things different now, though, but you're supposed to have a case worker. 

Recording: (8873/ 9621) 
 I would love to do it, but even when I was skinny, my knee won't let me. 

Recording: (8874/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8875/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (8876/ 9621) 
 That's where Memorial would have it. Valleydale had a ballad band and stuff like that. You know, places where kids could go. 

Recording: (8877/ 9621) 
 I have three brothers and sisters. My parents are divorced. I lived with my mom and those are the three over there. And then my dad's family. I have a brother and a sister over there. 

Recording: (8878/ 9621) 
 Now that kids are carrying knives and guns and things to school, you never know if you're going to walk into the building and maybe not go home that day. 

Recording: (8879/ 9621) 
 Technology. I mean, I like living in a world where technology puts everything I need at my fingertips. I mean, I think that's something that would not have happened had there not been a highly populist generation suddenly that was competing within itself. 

Recording: (8880/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8881/ 9621) 
 I disagree with society there. It should be something to work with. It's just like, hey, well, let's see, you're going to have this year, O'Brien. Ah, we're going to have a losing season. I don't care. 

Recording: (8882/ 9621) 
 this just can't go on. Not that they're going to stop it totally. 

Recording: (8883/ 9621) 
 We would ride the bus downtown. All the major stores were down there. There was a restaurant called Mills Restaurant. It was all glass. You could see through there, and there were different levels. White tablecloths. 

Recording: (8884/ 9621) 
 You wouldn't, I know right off the bat, I wouldn't be able to make as much money as him. Maybe if I do this college thing I would whack him out of the price range. 

Recording: (8885/ 9621) 
 You can get lost in mathematics almost, I think you could, of course, now they probably have. 

Recording: (8886/ 9621) 
 Yep, pork chops and macaroni and cheese, I'll eat that. 

Recording: (8887/ 9621) 
 Well, the minor league hockey team, the Columbus Chill, are never there. They don't have it now, but because the Blue Jackets came in. But I think it'd be good if it goes, but I'm just not sure that Columbus is going to support something like that. That's basically Ohio State, you know. And they don't even support the hockey team we got for Ohio State, you know. And yet they're good. 

Recording: (8888/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (8889/ 9621) 
 and I think that's probably why I feel the way I do now. 

Recording: (8890/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8891/ 9621) 
 I don't know, but if everybody's ever gone, I'll find some, I'm sure. 

Recording: (8892/ 9621) 
 I don't need to work that many hours. 

Recording: (8893/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (8894/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8895/ 9621) 
 What you do in Australia? 

Recording: (8896/ 9621) 
 Trending on girls that doesn't work that type of thing 

Recording: (8897/ 9621) 
 Oh, the top. I think that he lost her foot. 

Recording: (8898/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8899/ 9621) 
 And then when they did the blood test, they found out I had hypertension plus cardiovascular diseases. Had nothing to do with drugs. 

Recording: (8900/ 9621) 
 There's so much negativity on the national news. I don't know if it'll just be blended in or if people will associate that with Columbus. 

Recording: (8901/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8902/ 9621) 
 Put my hand here, try to keep it out of the line of the wire. 

Recording: (8903/ 9621) 
 Well, I mean, most of it was me going over it with him. And just, you know, I talked to some people, and they recommended this and recommended that. And then I looked at it, and, you know, just doing the things that worked for him and as an individual. 

Recording: (8904/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8905/ 9621) 
 Um, well, just even like the parks. 

Recording: (8906/ 9621) 
 $10,000 fine. Oh Man talk about cutting a coupon there, man 

Recording: (8907/ 9621) 
 I make them do their webbing and get their rough draft started and then they can go to the computer because I find they are a little more creative when they get to think about adding pictures and we call it publishing it, when you get to the publishing stage. 

Recording: (8908/ 9621) 
 difficult to find. 

Recording: (8909/ 9621) 
 Okay, she wouldn't come in and say, well, off with your head. 

Recording: (8910/ 9621) 
 My dad was crippled for nine months. He was in a cast from his neck down to his ankles. 

Recording: (8911/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8912/ 9621) 
 Have you ever heard him speak? 

Recording: (8913/ 9621) 
 Is that right? 

Recording: (8914/ 9621) 
 You know, I didn't realize because I used to love peanut butter. You know, on toast and crackers, I'd go home, you know, because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and it, you know, it kind of satisfied me. But this doctor took a couple tests and he realized it was the peanuts, which I would have never thought of that because I ate it for so long, all my life. 

Recording: (8915/ 9621) 
 Juniors or seniors in high school, I mean it wasn't anything too serious, it was just more, I guess a testosterone trip or something. 

Recording: (8916/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8917/ 9621) 
 Yes, it's the Democrat. 

Recording: (8918/ 9621) 
 Yeah, by then it was junior year when we were wrestling varsity and everyone just figured it was two more years left. They could just struggle through it. 

Recording: (8919/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8920/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8921/ 9621) 
 Cause they wouldn't let him when I was there. 

Recording: (8922/ 9621) 
 Yeah, talking about all these underage kids, 13, 14, 15, 16, even up to 18 years old, the Columbine shooting. I mean, all those just relate in one category that, you know, it's getting out of control here, Bill. Do something. 

Recording: (8923/ 9621) 
 and fired him. 

Recording: (8924/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's an old eye sore that they should have got rid of years ago. 

Recording: (8925/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (8926/ 9621) 
 So the original father wasn't around for the kids. 

Recording: (8927/ 9621) 
 Mhm. Right. 

Recording: (8928/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's a good idea. 

Recording: (8929/ 9621) 
 The core is 

Recording: (8930/ 9621) 
 But then again, I feel like sometimes I'm so naive. I mean, a lot of that wasn't introduced. And I was just like, well, should I have known that? 

Recording: (8931/ 9621) 
 Yes, they do. 

Recording: (8932/ 9621) 
 And I don't know whether Orrin did or not. He's never said anything if he has. But I think my attitude would be don't tell and, you know, the guys that come out very vociferously in favor of publicizing it and all that, I don't see what they expect to gain. I mean, if they—in fact in fact, I don't, I don't think that they do gain anything by it. 

Recording: (8933/ 9621) 
 Yeah, so I'm a new grandma. 

Recording: (8934/ 9621) 
 I think one of the things that we, when you're baptized is that you're really supposed to help other people to, like if somebody gives you a gift, you want to give it to someone else. But it's easy a lot of times just to fall into the, you know, like mold of not letting anyone know what you believe and just so that they think, well, what are those weirdos? You know, they don't wear makeup or whatever, but we can wear makeup if we want. But so I think for a lot of times people do fall in just sort of, but I was not raised Mormon. So I have a lot of my family and friends who are still not members of the church and also because it's so new to me that I am just you know, I will talk about it with anybody and and And so and I'm also not afraid of people who aren't Mormons because I think if you grow up like a member of the church and you might be more afraid of people that don't believe like you've been taught. I think a lot of the, you know, we don't drink alcohol. There's a lot of restrictions. I guess you'd call them restrictions, but I feel like they're more just health codes that just keep you healthy. So it might be, it's like if America, we're used to being raised one way. If we went to another country, just kind of like, you might want to get to know the Chinese people, but you might not quite be a little timid about, you know, same kind of thing. But I don't have any of those barriers. 

Recording: (8935/ 9621) 
 Well, I mean... 

Recording: (8936/ 9621) 
 badly, but 

Recording: (8937/ 9621) 
 A couple that are adopted will be able to get counseling for her. 

Recording: (8938/ 9621) 
 When you're 55 or is it 62, whatever age, is it age limitation or based upon age or disability or being out of town, you're allowed. So routinely we've done the absentee over the years. No, going back to basic politicians, I think the vast majority are truly good, honest people. They try to mean well. I'm concerned always that people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start, but the tremendous influences are brought to bear that they never had had the opportunity to comprehend before they got there and they're just overwhelmed. I don't necessarily think it's a dishonesty. It's like a tidal wave. They get caught up and they can't resist the direction it's being pushed or they are being pushed. 

Recording: (8939/ 9621) 
 and now it's our turn to deal with the issues. We see our parents, we see this generation, all these things that are still popular, so we don't look down on the 60s. I mean, I think the 60s sound like a pretty fun time to live. I'll get into politics in a second. But those things are popularized, but no, we can't do it anymore because we've got all these problems. 

Recording: (8940/ 9621) 
 Oh, come back. I mean, if you need me to. 

Recording: (8941/ 9621) 
 Heheheheheheheheh 

Recording: (8942/ 9621) 
 Whenever it comes on I roll my eyes. That episode where they were stuck out in space and... If the tape can catch me rolling my eyes... 

Recording: (8943/ 9621) 
 and then I'm probably going to be working on my portfolio the second term. 

Recording: (8944/ 9621) 
 or Northland. 

Recording: (8945/ 9621) 
 And so I got some of the inside dope out of the area from him. But they had—I don't know whether it had been a large granary or something that had a concrete floor. And some industrious GI had chipped a hole about so big around in that. 

Recording: (8946/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, it's only it's still 10 till 7. Yeah 

Recording: (8947/ 9621) 
 Yeah, where would you send it? If you could send us to one of the TV programs and have like Oprah Winfrey or somewhere and get it all over the world You know all of the United States or something so people really hear it then maybe it would might do some good if people would begin to speak up You know what why don't they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what do people really think it would help to do instead of having things like Oprah Winfrey and who's those other couple guys to get on and ask the most stupid questions and 

Recording: (8948/ 9621) 
 which I've never done, I don't want to. But to me, some drugs should be legal, some drugs should be illegal. But to me, alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs. 

Recording: (8949/ 9621) 
 Homosexuality, I guess. 

Recording: (8950/ 9621) 
 No. 

Recording: (8951/ 9621) 
 but at the same time I don't think I'd really hold it against him. 

Recording: (8952/ 9621) 
 Oh my gosh. It's one of them, like, you know, falling out of trees. 

Recording: (8953/ 9621) 
 And we'd adjust the guns, call down shifts, so they could come within reasonable, close to that. 

Recording: (8954/ 9621) 
 Because she has been known to help herself to bread. We were like brain dead after this race and my husband took her and we know better but we were like, you know, after you run you're kind of like, ehhh. And she actually jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread. I'm like, oh my gosh. 

Recording: (8955/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8956/ 9621) 
 You know? 

Recording: (8957/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I get to argue about stuff there. Here, I'm just kind of sitting around. 

Recording: (8958/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (8959/ 9621) 
 You like the university level. 

Recording: (8960/ 9621) 
 actually being able to resend the funding, but still, I mean, it's a, we don't like to think about these things happening. 

Recording: (8961/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (8962/ 9621) 
 And I don't know whether my second, I don't think my second sister ever went to school out there. But things were so tough that, and mom had taught school in Iowa where she grew up and got her teacher's certificate. So I guess she and dad agreed that if they could find someone to stay with us kids through the day, she could teach. 

Recording: (8963/ 9621) 
 No, not really. I don't know what even is to eat down here. Oxley's. 

Recording: (8964/ 9621) 
 Well, let's see, I got divorced when I, oldest was three, my youngest was about six months, almost a year. So I've raised them basically myself. Yeah, so I did go back to work. 

Recording: (8965/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (8966/ 9621) 
 It's just like bingo numbers. 

Recording: (8967/ 9621) 
 It's kind of funny, you're allowed to drink before you're allowed to drive. 

Recording: (8968/ 9621) 
 I was a baby, you know, under one. 

Recording: (8969/ 9621) 
 There's too much information and too much change. Librarians, this is against probably what the image of librarians are. They're very eager to embrace change. Internet came out and when it got out of the area, it was being used by universities or whatever for research. That's what it was at first. Librarians were right there and they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it. PCs. It was revolutionary when we announced that we were going to use IBM PCs for access to the system and we'd provide you software. You could do some of the work that you're used to doing with us in your computer. It was incredible. We had trouble with the demand. It was triple what we expected. Librarians were ready for it. 

Recording: (8970/ 9621) 
 and it's great. We've been re-engineered the last eight years ODOT downsizing and trying to fit the attributes the person brings to work as opposed to one of the problems I see as an employer or supervisor, manager, a lot of times we have to promote because well, the bureaucracy says you have to do this in order to get up there. They don't take into consideration the attributes the person has. So now we're saying okay if you bring this attribute to the table and you can help the team out then why not reward you instead of putting you over here in let's say a managerial position which you really don't have any call for but you're there because the money only. Okay so we're trying to fit the attribute to the person and compensate them accordingly which hey I think we did that we probably have more teachers. 

Recording: (8971/ 9621) 
 And why don't people use their time? And it's free. Rather they get all tensed up and mad because they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of their way because they got to get there. 

Recording: (8972/ 9621) 
 lol 

Recording: (8973/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (8974/ 9621) 
 And the house smells wonderful. It's like birthday cakes. I think my wife's was the last one. I make her one, and we trade off. And I bought a Betty Crocker at Odd Lots. It was $0.22. The icing was $0.22. I made it, and everybody goes, this is really good. It's like a sour cream icing. And I go, yeah. And they go, boy, this is really good. And they go, did you buy this? And I go, no, I made it. And they go, really? And I go, yeah, it cost me $0.44. 

Recording: (8975/ 9621) 
 there's no need to attack students over it. And I read some article in the Lantern, I don't know why I read that, I hate that paper, but anyway, I read some article that the guy said he's not trying to attack students, he just wants them to get annoyed so they'll go whine to their parents about how the university does it, and then they can all fight the establishment. 

Recording: (8976/ 9621) 
 But like if you said, we'll have a bus service, we'll go and pick you guys up, you know, and then you can't use the excuse my car broke down or something. And then like if you, even to give them like, it doesn't even have to be a hot meal I would think for breakfast or anything, you know, if you're running three shifts you could just, you know, here's a box of donuts and some milk or something, you know, and that doesn't cost the company that much. 

Recording: (8977/ 9621) 
 Why not the C caller. And I mean, that's not something that you would think a head coach at a high stake would say, you know. 

Recording: (8978/ 9621) 
 Well. 

Recording: (8979/ 9621) 
 and there's tubes and all that. I mean, I remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking at that thinking, that's me, you know. 

Recording: (8980/ 9621) 
 I learned about them from somebody I was working with who liked them and listened to a lot of their music. He loaned me some and I taped it. I saw their video, their Wall Street Gorilla video. I don't know if you've ever seen that. It was fun. It was fun. 

Recording: (8981/ 9621) 
 I helped him set up different things, helped him clean him up afterwards, prep patients, all kinds of different things. That was a lot of blood and stuff, but I don't know. When it's not you, it seems a little easier to observe, I guess. When you see somebody you know, it's a little more concerning to you. I don't know. But you see a lot of different stuff. And I hope that the majority of it's helping this person out. Now my wife, you know, she works, she worked in intensive care, open heart surgery, different patients like that. And that's a lot different than where she is now with the cancer, because there's so many different factors there. You know, she says it's so hard to see somebody 30 years old and they come in and they have breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things. She says, you know, two or three times a week, you know, your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and now you're going to be going for chemotherapy, radiation, all this stuff, you know. It's unbelievable how many, it's just hard to believe how many people go through there. They're talking 50, 60 patients a day. 

Recording: (8982/ 9621) 
 You know what I mean? It don't matter to me whether you're black or white. It matters to me whatever way you treat me. Like when I first got out of the services, when they really started affirmative action, I was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they couldn't hire me because that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks. 

Recording: (8983/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (8984/ 9621) 
 the risks and what goes into it. And like I said, I mean, it doesn't really hurt anyone the high part of it. 

Recording: (8985/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (8986/ 9621) 
 And it's interesting that they advertise that when you go there, though, if you get that room, that's what you get. 

Recording: (8987/ 9621) 
 So they can tend to, they'll eat all day. Cats, yeah, you just put a bowl of kitten chow. That's their life, you know? 

Recording: (8988/ 9621) 
 I went there for Career Center in high school. And that was something that was exciting for me, but that's totally out of the question for me now. Because I have a kid, and there's no way I would do that.

 So like 30 of them will go out at one time and 30 will come back. Well, that isn't too bad, but they're mixed in with everybody else that's normally flying, like all the airliners and stuff. And they want to get their ASAP. So I just don't feel comfortable doing that much at one time. OSU was not a dead place. It was very busy. It's like the third busiest in Ohio. But yeah, it's amazing. And they're only open 16 hours a day. 

Recording: (8990/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (8991/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8992/ 9621) 
 Yeah, you. 

Recording: (8993/ 9621) 
 Um, actually, I guess it's something that's always sort of been there. I've always been real big on just building things. I mean, been real big hands on. And last summer I helped my dad build a garage onto his house. Like, I mean, literally, I mean, we poured the foundation and everything, like, built everything up from there. And it turned out really well, and I mean, it was really fun to do. I mean, it's, I liked it a lot better than being stuck inside all the time. 

Recording: (8994/ 9621) 
 Gun control, I'm not really too interested in. I mean, you look at Israel, people are carrying guns on the street, big, huge guns, and they're one of the safest nations in the country. Then you look at England, they have no guns at all, and they're relatively safe. So, I mean, 

Recording: (8995/ 9621) 
 and get my loan shark in trouble. 

Recording: (8996/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (8997/ 9621) 
 Oh, no, that's fine. Thanks. 

Recording: (8998/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry.

 She'll be 19 in September. 

Recording: (9000/ 9621) 
 Mmm, I wasn't there that long. 

Recording: (9001/ 9621) 
 You know, because then what does he have to hide? And then, like the fact that he didn't know, like I think on international policy he'll be struggling if he becomes president. He didn't know the three leaders of the world thing. And then on top of it, like Texas is a fairly big economy, but still like to manage an entire, you know, an entire economy. 

Recording: (9002/ 9621) 
 Oh definitely, definitely. Well I've never had a dog and I've always wanted one. 

Recording: (9003/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9004/ 9621) 
 And it stays with you for years. They don't realize that. Nobody tells them until after the fact. 

Recording: (9005/ 9621) 
 Uh huh. 

Recording: (9006/ 9621) 
 Like, I'm not really sure how the interview works to become a teacher. I don't know. I think it's like a lot of times they're really desperate to find people, and so they really just take whoever. I mean, they're lucky enough to even have a body to fill the place, and they're doing well enough. I mean, the kids are learning the material, I mean, sort of. I mean, it's working well enough I guess. I mean, people are learning things and wanting to go on to college and stuff. 

Recording: (9007/ 9621) 
 Well, I've had the house for probably six or seven years and we just need to move. It's kind of small. It's a smaller house. My husband works in Gahanna so we were going to look for some houses up that way and maybe some land. We've been looking at some land up north too. 

Recording: (9008/ 9621) 
 You know. 

Recording: (9009/ 9621) 
 That'd be like, you know, what the hell, they putting on some kind of gay race to make you gay? Yeah. 

Recording: (9010/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we probably eventually will do that. But I'm like so up in the air about what I want to do. And there's so many things to do out there that I need to take time to think about it. 

Recording: (9011/ 9621) 
 It's like with this adoption of the baby, we know that that's best, but dealing with the emotions of it, we're very family oriented. And this is a grandchild we'll never see. 

Recording: (9012/ 9621) 
 Ha ha ha ha ha. 

Recording: (9013/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9014/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9015/ 9621) 
 It 

Recording: (9016/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9017/ 9621) 
 Well, 

Recording: (9018/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9019/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9020/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I can't, you went to Europe and you missed Spain? Oh, okay. See, that'll be it. You can plan that as a second honeymoon. I'm sure your wife would object. Sure, you're just gonna... It's just, it's just wow, this has blown my mind. So I said, okay, Spanish looks good. So it's just a degree. So I can just get out and go and travel. Like you say, a lot of these companies, a lot of these like you say, well, you know, I don't of state? So are you out to campus? Actually, I live at Riverwatch Towers on Lane Avenue. Much nicer than the dorms. Oh, no, it's like right across the street. Oh, yeah. I got like two roommates. I highly recommend the roommate thing. Oh, yeah. It's like I guess it's kind of like a hostile environment. It's like you get to know everybody. It's pretty much an apartment. You become friends with everybody off that. I'm hoping that's the same deal when I travel. It's easy to make friends and hook up and say, oh you got a job? Hook me up. 

Recording: (9021/ 9621) 
 Well... 

Recording: (9022/ 9621) 
 I mean, come on, who wasn't picked on, you know? 

Recording: (9023/ 9621) 
 She got a divorce when I was three. 

Recording: (9024/ 9621) 
 You don't use coupons. 

Recording: (9025/ 9621) 
 which is not a lot. 

Recording: (9026/ 9621) 
 Mwahaha 

Recording: (9027/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9028/ 9621) 
 Then you can go visit what the empire is at, the big thing, like the Statue of Liberty. 

Recording: (9029/ 9621) 
 It is. Yeah, because pediatricians are able to dispense it. I just felt like trying to avoid it as much as possible growing up. 

Recording: (9030/ 9621) 
 But when you look at Coleman, there was a point where they asked a yes or no question. 

Recording: (9031/ 9621) 
 No. This is Sherry. 

Recording: (9032/ 9621) 
 I'm impressed. I'm like, okay, I tried to build a car and it didn't look like anything. 

Recording: (9033/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9034/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9035/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9036/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think so, I think so. And like, neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity to me, you know? 

Recording: (9037/ 9621) 
 It's probably family by family. I mean, that's why I was a little bit late leaving work the way it was. We've got two co-workers. One has her child at the same daycare as myself. She's about a year now and I'm listening to her. I mean, she's there, you know, 60, 70 hours a week. I mean, she dropped off at 6 a.m. and not picked up until 6.30 p.m. and she's fine with that. Me personally, there's no way, because somebody is totally, in my opinion, raising that child. You aren't getting to put your values, your traditions, what's important to you, onto that child. Now the other girl, she just has a four month old and has been in daycare now for three weeks and she's going to quit her job and go to working nights three days a week because it is important to her to be at home with him. 

Recording: (9038/ 9621) 
 So she so I probably did learn a little bit cuz I she's still that she's Lives with the man now and he does all the cooking still so I've learned everything on my own upon cooking and stuff like that which I did love to cook 

Recording: (9039/ 9621) 
 I think society of today is less tolerant of a lot of things that they see where people getting by with stuff, you know. And they're more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it. Back in the 60s and stuff, you know, not here, but you know, down south there were people still getting hung and stuff, you know, for being a black or something. And you know, there are bad blacks and there's bad whites too, but not all of them are that way. 

Recording: (9040/ 9621) 
 Plus if they shoot somebody accidentally, number one, it's really hard to, and secondly, it probably won't kill them like a gun can. And you have to use your brain. So I didn't come from a hunting background. But my husband does work for the state highway patrol, so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns. But none of them, hardly any of them hunt. And a lot of them, they respect them. If you know what I mean. They realize they can kill people guns. That's the problem. It's the people that are teaching 

Recording: (9041/ 9621) 
 So I'm sure that probably increases the rate in public schools for. 

Recording: (9042/ 9621) 
 I do more summer sports. But he's just beginning on the computer. I'm pretty computer literate. I've really never had a job yet. It's always been working with food or plants. 

Recording: (9043/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9044/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (9045/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9046/ 9621) 
 and you register them and then you just keep after them. You keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign. In Ohio I think it's easier to do that because there is a law that I don't think it's in primaries but in general elections at 11 o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon they have to list those who have voted. They have to put up a list of registered voters and cross out those who have voted. So what I used to do is I took my list that I had gotten from the Board of Elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support or was undecided on the election, and I would cross off those that had voted, and then I had a list of those that hadn't, and I had people waiting at a phone bank, and I'd call them at work or at home, and I'd offer to take them to the polls. If you don't have a ride, we will take you to the polls. If you're worried about someone watching your kids, we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote. Because I've also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office and are reminded to go, will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that. Because what I did was, it's a very low key thing, I would call people on election day and say, hi, this is Roberta, I'm calling to remind you that today is election day, and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom, which is to go vote, and oh, by the way, when you go to vote, we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy. And if you need a ride, let me know. We've got them set up for you. And but, you know, that's very I mean, and that's not getting people to vote and encourage them to vote because they should. That's a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate. I don't know how you get people to vote. I don't know why they don't think it's important, maybe because we've had it too easy. My grandfather didn't. My grandfather didn't. I mean, there was a king and queen and he had no right to vote. So when he came here and he could, that was the most important thing in the world to him. And he just passed it on to his daughter, my mother, my father. I don't know how it was important to him, but it was always important to him. We talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes. We talked about issues and he said it was important to be heard. So I don't know if it got passed on parent-wise or what it was. 

Recording: (9047/ 9621) 
 About 15 minutes. My mom and I don't go too far from each other. But Jason's going to take the week off and everything, so I think that we'll be able to do that. 

Recording: (9048/ 9621) 
 that's not right. So I've always gotten 2% raises, even though basically, I've been cross trained or however you want to say it, I can work in three or four areas where most people can't. But I've seen people get 10% raises. And I've seen me get 2% raise when I'm doing three jobs, and they're doing one. 

Recording: (9049/ 9621) 
 I don't know how to get to it like the way we walk, but I don't know what street it's on. 

Recording: (9050/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think mostly they did. I was kind of surprised. Which class was this in? I think this was in that introduction to the arts class. I was kind of surprised that one of the students in my class thought it was very hard. And I didn't think it was that hard at all, but she wrote me some kind of nasty note at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight A average at this school before my class and I was giving her a B and her average was gonna be ruined and she hoped I felt guilty about it? Not really. Not really. I mean I was grading on it pretty much of a curve too. I mean I was trying really not to flunk anybody that was attempting to do the work. I think I flunked one person that was really goofing off. But in terms of a curve I had A's, I had B's, I had a few C's. Yeah, so yeah, oh well. 

Recording: (9051/ 9621) 
 Well, when you get into the black population, you sometimes see some 

Recording: (9052/ 9621) 
 Whether they're playing a video game where they're shooting people, I can't see that as being something that affects them. 

Recording: (9053/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9054/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (9055/ 9621) 
 Yeah. Yeah. 

Recording: (9056/ 9621) 
 It is. 

Recording: (9057/ 9621) 
 Just get me a couple shirts or something. You know, she always bought my clothes anyway, so just get me a couple, get me whatever you think I need, you know. I'll be here drinking beer, watching sports, you know. 

Recording: (9058/ 9621) 
 little girl. I always think you should name a kid, I have opinions about everything, see? I think you should name a kid something that will fit him at 83 and 8 and in between. Like we named our son Robert. So when he was little he was Robbie. Now he's 18, he's Rob. When he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do, he can be Robert, Paul, you know. And in kindergarten all he had to learn to write was ROB or ROBBY. So that, you know, I have a hard time picturing an 83-year-old woman as a Tammy. 

Recording: (9059/ 9621) 
 It's actually not that difficult. 

Recording: (9060/ 9621) 
 I was the only one on my whole block. 

Recording: (9061/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but it's not a good way for me to make money. Because if you're farming out people, or if you're better still, drop it down a level, if you are exchanging hours for money or time for money, then you have a finite amount of time. And that sucks. 

Recording: (9062/ 9621) 
 Well, I think only because I went abroad I had basically one extra quarter beyond four years. 

Recording: (9063/ 9621) 
 So that's, I guess I do have some family by marriage. But they live near Bloomington.

Recording: (9066/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9067/ 9621) 
 That's how I feel. That's what I believe. I choose to believe that. 

Recording: (9068/ 9621) 
 So I just think the more you're open about things, I just think that's the best. When you put things and don't talk about it, that's when the problems start.

 college without the tuition. 

Recording: (9076/ 9621) 
 at least being able to be a part of their kids' life.

 And then after so long a time, after I don't know how long, again, the powers that be said, well, we'll fool them. We'll fog up that whole area with smoke. 

Recording: (9078/ 9621) 
 because I didn't start dating till I was almost 17. But almost everybody else had even I'm going to be 36 here in a week or two. So we're talking I graduated in 82. Where now I think kids are dating at like 1011 12. 

Recording: (9079/ 9621) 
 Nationals getting that way too. They're all getting that way anymore. Used to be analysis with the news. You don't get that at all anymore. 

Recording: (9080/ 9621) 
 Like a little coffee shop. 

Recording: (9081/ 9621) 
 Yeah, high school a lot of people are really narrow-minded and work on really trying to fit in. In college people are more open-minded and they're more willing to express their own ideas.

 Tess, yeah.

 So if you're not wearing the Nikes.

 I'm a, it's kind of a unique position. I guess I'm a, my job title is a Senior Research Associate. I received my Bachelor's, Master's, PhD, and Nurse Practitioner all from here, from OSU. And I'm working down at Dodd Hall in a research position. I'm also a Nurse Practitioner down there that sees patients in follow-up and in clinic.

 You know, because when you're overseas, it's a different environment.

Recording: (9097/ 9621) 
 I thought they'd give you at least student rates or graduate student rates or whatever, like the Wexner Center.

 Well, I wanted to go to Missouri or come here, but she says, the only reason you want me to come here is because you get a football ticket or something. 

Recording: (9100/ 9621) 
 That comes back to the lack of our morals and our society promotes it. They're doing the tax laws and all the government. You say government do this? Government's doing it to themselves.

 Right.

 Yeah, there's you know our shop only has about five people out of 20 maybe that have been here over 10 years probably a lot of turnover a lot of People go on to management positions and or leave or but once you've got 20 years and it's like you can't leave now, you know, I'm like

 And he goes, do you hear me? And I go, yeah. And he goes, you got a trip. Be out at the airport at 4.30. And I go, I don't know. He says, you hear me? And I go, yeah, yeah, yeah. He goes, well, get some sleep. And he turns the lights off, pulls the door shut. And I'm laying there. And I'm like, I've been home like three hours. And now I'm just fuming. And I thought, I know a college education doesn't guarantee you financial security. But I thought, what am I doing working from dusk, I mean dawn to way past dusk, six days a week, and making nothing and having people like this come tell me, you've got to go to work tomorrow. So I went upstairs and knocked on his door and told him I quit. And he wasn't very thrilled about that. But one of my students was a controller. And he came and talked to me. And he says, I heard you quit. And he says, I want to tell you about my job. And he was a controller and he came and talked to me and he says I heard you quit and he says I want to tell you about my job and he was a controller at Owensboro Kentucky and he said he worked 40 hours a week and I go well I usually do that by Wednesday and he said that he had annual leave and sick leave and I said what are

 And I think some of my feelings about that sort of thing is colored by the fact that I collected data for 20 years from employers. I'm a lot more sympathetic to that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm just a lot more sympathetic to people collecting data.

 No, the prompts are only given out that day. Even the teachers don't know what they're going to be.

 Studying music for a while and then studying chemistry. Yeah. No, I didn't think of any projects where I could use both.

 Pretty well. 

Recording: (9128/ 9621) 
 It's amazing. And that's something I know my husband, we always joke about. He tells his guys at work, you know, like, you know, to take flowers for no reason. You know, like one guy was selling, he was saying something about his anniversary, and Peter said, well, are you going to take flowers? How many guys goes, oh, I don't know. And he said, trust me, take some flowers.

 It would be interesting to see how much of your generation is saving First of all, how much are they earning? How much they expect to pay for a house? And all these other things, you know, they say to you I'll say 10% church then you got all G $5 here made 20 cents of 20 cents an hour here and get can get this. You figure all those up. All these campaigns you hear during the course of a year. I often thought it would be great for marketing. Take all those figures and add up and see if it adds up to 100%. And if it does, then where are your goals? See when I bought a house, the financier came in and I went to his office and he said, oh Mr. No problem, no problem. You can get that house. I said, I can? Yeah, you're a professional and your wife's professional. I said, that's how you're evaluating it on both both of us? Yes. I said, I don't want to do business with you. Why? I'm going to give you a loan. I said, I don't want to do business with you because you didn't ask me about my goals. My goal was not to have my wife work because nowadays it takes two of them to work. I'm wondering when they're going to get child labor law revoked for that because with two of them working, I'm wondering how many more hours a day you can squeeze out of a couple's personal life so they'll have sanity at some time in their life to enjoy life. When these people start realizing, hey, we're chasing our tails, then that couple got wise and said, hey, we're going to do with less and we're going to go for quality. When that couple reaches that mentality, Mr. Loan Officer, you're going to have a greater society to work with and you won't have as many possessions. I'm sorry, it goes against your goal, but it's more positive for our for our society and That's been it my wife's been working part-time All her tenure if it's fine keep her license up she's a nurse but the thing is I Don't want I didn't want her. I want her to be home with the kids. I didn't want somebody else over our kids And I don't know if our kids realize this or not, but I do know my brother-in-law mentioned to his parents, he said, gosh, what a sacrifice you guys did for us. And he's just turned 50. And they don't have any kids. And he says, well, I don't know how you did it. Well, for one thing, they probably did a lot of sacrificing. And when you sacrifice, it makes you more humble. 

Recording: (9131/ 9621) 
 No, did you? It's probably because your ad was in the paper in the summer when we weren't doing anything. I wanted something to do. 

Recording: (9132/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9133/ 9621) 
 You got bears? 

Recording: (9134/ 9621) 
 I did my bitching, but it really wasn't nothing to do about it, because once they have their word in it, they're 

Recording: (9135/ 9621) 
 Really. 

Recording: (9136/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we'd like to garden and that was one of the things too. We want some space to make a bigger garden. No, no we kind of help my neighbor out. He's got a big garden next door so we help him and he's retired. 

Recording: (9137/ 9621) 
 But it's not. 

Recording: (9138/ 9621) 
 But the dispatch, the only reason I get the dispatch is I do want to know what's going on locally. 

Recording: (9139/ 9621) 
 I think the latter I don't think will make any difference. The kids that I know in junior high and in college, it just doesn't make any difference to them. And they don't like those classes. They think they're boring. They think it has no relevance to their life. 

Recording: (9140/ 9621) 
 Personally, no, I don't think so. 

Recording: (9141/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9142/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9143/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (9144/ 9621) 
 You know, like I said, he's great to me and everything, but I wouldn't want to be married to him. 

Recording: (9145/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it's ridiculous. Plus it's a nationally recognized school, so a degree from Ohio State, I mean, you could go anywhere in the nation, someone's at least going to recognize it because it's a big name. Ashland would be more of a sell. I'd be like, okay, it's small, it's private, it's accredited, but still. 

Recording: (9146/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right. 

Recording: (9147/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9148/ 9621) 
 And I didn't even want, you know, and I knew my mom, it's like if she can save a nickel somewhere, you know, she will. So I knew that that's how they were and I didn't want to, you know, it was my choice to get married, it was my choice to have kids and, you know, I didn't, I didn't feel the need to ask them. Well, I think 

Recording: (9149/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm, I did. 

Recording: (9150/ 9621) 
 Yeah, one is still in high school and she's ready to, she wants to go on to college. So she's pretty much ready to go. I mean, she's got one more year of high school, but, and I held her back in kindergarten. So she's an older graduate. She'll be 19 when she graduates. And then on the other hand, graduated when she was 17. So then my youngest daughter, Amy, she is, she's doing real well. I mean, she's getting really good grades, A's and B's. And with, she had kind of a hard time in high school. She was raped by a teacher in ninth grade when she first went into a school. And from there, it's just been a nightmare of what, how that it's affected her know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and say oh I wonder you know if she was like that because of this and you know so that's been a real struggle in high school I was I never really was that excited about it for her because the memories she has she went on to a different school and she met a lot of good people there and she 

Recording: (9151/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (9152/ 9621) 
 now. 

Recording: (9153/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah! 

Recording: (9154/ 9621) 
 Oh, I bet. 

Recording: (9155/ 9621) 
 went on, but I'm not sure about the rest. 

Recording: (9156/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I got more people to buy presents for though. 

Recording: (9157/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9158/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (9159/ 9621) 
 I mean, that is an 

Recording: (9160/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9161/ 9621) 
 Eh. 

Recording: (9162/ 9621) 
 Um, actually, oddly enough, that's what I'm putting in. 

Recording: (9163/ 9621) 
 Oh, I know it. I know it. That's really what's hard. 

Recording: (9164/ 9621) 
 I'm not. 

Recording: (9165/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9166/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I'd do that. 

Recording: (9167/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (9168/ 9621) 
 Yeah, if they want, if they, you know, choose. I'm sure there's, you know, women that are lesbians that have been with men also, you know. They've been with a man and then they've been with a woman now. Now they got a girlfriend. So obviously, you know, and I feel like that was because they had an attraction towards a woman. So now they think they're lesbian. I don't see, I don't, that's why I think, so I don't think that, but if that's their choice, that's their choice. So I do think they could change. 

Recording: (9169/ 9621) 
 Totally like the directions and the homework and everything is all 100% in German 

Recording: (9170/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9171/ 9621) 
 I do. 

Recording: (9172/ 9621) 
 Actually, Kauai. Yeah, so it was really nice. I thought, of course I didn't go to all of them, but it was nice. 

Recording: (9173/ 9621) 
 So to that end, we have a designated Friday evening date night. Sherry usually tries to get all of Saturday and all of Sunday as date night as well. So we're like an extended weekend thing. 

Recording: (9174/ 9621) 
 Not really, but I think living in the Bible Belt, as she did, she was living there 10 years before she married and got involved in a youth group. And I think that that was very influential on her decision. And so she was not married in the church, all my other children were. But, you know, she's, she is going her own path and that's fine with me. She's a very good girl. She's very conscientious and 

Recording: (9175/ 9621) 
 We teach English to little kids or help clean or work at libraries or different things. 

Recording: (9176/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. 

Recording: (9177/ 9621) 
 They go out there and there was a, I suppose, a county seat town and they file a claim on a certain area of land. It was surveyed off and marked off in sections. A section of land is 640 acres. That sounds like a lot of, it is a good sized area. 

Recording: (9178/ 9621) 
 Have you really? Have you gone to see all the shows? 

Recording: (9179/ 9621) 
 And then we'd go do what we wanted to do. 

Recording: (9180/ 9621) 
 And you know, I just really think they need to make that an option for a young girl. I really do, because there's just too many unwanted children. There just is. And that really bothers me that we don't have another option like another country. We're a lot more right wing here in America. But I just feel that's got to be an option for these young girls. It just really does. 

Recording: (9181/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9182/ 9621) 
 Chances or chance it whatever from Molly. Female. So that was her name from Molly. She thought boy they're nice in this country. They even named my baby for me. People are so stupid. 

Recording: (9183/ 9621) 
 We got divorced in 88. 

Recording: (9184/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9185/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (9186/ 9621) 
 and they leave and you get either another asshole or somebody good. You just wait until you get somebody good. 

Recording: (9187/ 9621) 
 And then the people that enjoy you think, why are we hiring these guys? What are they thinking? 

Recording: (9188/ 9621) 
 I blame it on that, yeah, because, you know, there's been a lot more kids that have died in school than, you know, just recently. I guess it wasn't in the big numbers at one time, but there's been random violence in schools, you know, where kids have died even more than, you know, seven or whatever. And I think that the media has just made it into something, that've glamorized it and some of the kids I think they're screwed up anyway, and they're just like well hey, you know I Can do that and I'll be on the yeah, I do. I think that's a big part of that Because they want their name known and they don't care if they die anyway. 

Recording: (9189/ 9621) 
 Actually, they are working on it. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. They've just instated some bonus schemes where as the poverty level, I think, is considered 13,000 pounds a year. And if you're below the poverty level and you do go back to work, you get a certain extra bonus beyond. So there's a bonus for back to work. You mentioned earlier about how this would affect the children with this two-year welfare thing. I mean, at least I know a lot more about the system there for whatever reason than I do about the system here, which is kind of unfortunate. But there, I mean, I don't really think, in a lot of situations, of course, I'm sure there are people who follow it as it should be and who really need it and who are really taking care of their children. But unfortunately, you don't really see that side very much. You see the people who, like, their kids see none of that money. They're left at home by themselves if they can even get them to school, if they even go to school, if they're even bothered. And there are documentaries on all the time there, so you really sort of, it's more in your face than it is here that I ever noticed. But I do think, and with that, they have specific programs for the children. And I think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that if a kid has bad behavior or bad attendance, that you send them home. I mean, I think that's the most ridiculous thing. Like, surely that's not a punishment for a lot of these kids. And you know, at least in England on these things I've seen, you know, they send them home and these kids are just doing whatever, going around the neighborhood shoplifting, bullying, you know, hot wiring cars at the age of, you know, 10 or something. And I don't know, I think I do have sort of very strong opinions about people who are having all these kids and don't take care of them at all. 

Recording: (9190/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9191/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9192/ 9621) 
 And I don't like sitting in an office. 

Recording: (9193/ 9621) 
 Because the therapist did it. Yeah. 

Recording: (9194/ 9621) 
 Yeah, um, I've grown up here all my life so it really hasn't shocked me all that much. 

Recording: (9195/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9196/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (9197/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. I like it. 

Recording: (9198/ 9621) 
 And when I started as an apprentice in the shop, they said, well, we'll start you at a dollar an hour. I thought that sounded pretty good, you know, in 1945, the fall of 1945. So then as things worked out in Washington, D.C., they came out with the GLI Bill of Rights. We found out that that would apply to apprentices, too. 

Recording: (9199/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9200/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9201/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9202/ 9621) 
 I picked 80 pounds of pot one time, going along the railroad tracks and brought it back to Columbus. 80 pounds. 

Recording: (9203/ 9621) 
 Well, I read a lot about these particular British artists even before the show and before the mayor had a cow, so to speak. Some of the pieces are interesting. It's not exactly my style, but frankly, I just didn't see anything to get that worked up about. I mean, I saw the piece that he specifically objected to and read about it. So I mean, I have to assume that it's an election year. 

Recording: (9204/ 9621) 
 isn't. 

Recording: (9205/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they called me like a few times, begging me to come. I know how hard that is for white males to get into. 

Recording: (9206/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9207/ 9621) 
 as a result of the one trying to force myself back into what to do. So I mean, yeah, when you come down to these things, there's people with mental illness and with a disability are trying to pawn off the responsibility onto everybody but themselves. You know, well, the medical doctors, if they would have seen this guy and given him medication, he wouldn't have went out there and killed somebody. Shoulda, woulda, coulda, man. If the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will, that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day. Just like it's mine to take mine every day. And when I stopped taking mine, that was my responsibility, which is why I don't want to go to the legal system to try and make an excuse even though there's some law that protects people that if they were drunk or on the influence of medication or off the influence of medication, in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract, that they wouldn't be liable. 

Recording: (9208/ 9621) 
 See, that's great though. 

Recording: (9209/ 9621) 
 I live in Albany, therefore I'm cool. 

Recording: (9210/ 9621) 
 Do you have any friendly animals whatsoever in Australia? You know, we have bears in America. It's like, well, if they see you. 

Recording: (9211/ 9621) 
 when 

Recording: (9212/ 9621) 
 Okay, I... 

Recording: (9213/ 9621) 
 No, and yeah, he's a mixture between Forrest Gump and Archie Bunker. 

Recording: (9214/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9215/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9216/ 9621) 
 Right! 

Recording: (9217/ 9621) 
 And they would ask, you know, can I do this? Can I use this? Kids now, if I take my phone off and lay it on my desk, kids will walk right up and just take it. They won't ask me. They're just like, oh. And then they start pushing buttons. Is this your phone? If I were at your house and I went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking, you wouldn't like it much, would you? 

Recording: (9218/ 9621) 
 That's because it's kind of like warm and tropical. That's why they like it down there. 

Recording: (9219/ 9621) 
 That's good to be there. 

Recording: (9220/ 9621) 
 The trouble is, if he doesn't get wise too much, he's usually about 40 years of age when he says, gosh darn it, I wish I had listened. 

Recording: (9221/ 9621) 
 And at least it gave you a lot of different views. 

Recording: (9222/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (9223/ 9621) 
 It might. I mean, good teachers do that. I still get upset. When I was teaching school, I did activity-based teaching. And I was doing some volunteer work at Dublin schools, which is supposed to be one of the better schools in the area. And I thought there'd be all sorts of creative things going on, and there wasn't. It was still read the chapter, write the answers to the questions at the end of the book. And I thought, how boring. I mean, there are different ways to get kids turned on to things. I'm not sure there's so much influence from the media, and I say media broad based, be it print media or TV, that has this culture today of stars and media phenomenons and they don't see the relevance and I don't think they hear from their parents like I did the importance of voting and that's where it comes from their parents don't vote so if their parents don't vote they aren't. Again I don't know what the the answer is but it's very scary what's going to happen in the next couple of generations. The only good thought for me as I think about this is that I won't be here to see the disintegration of the democracy. Although I have great faith too. I have great faith in democracy. There are always good people that somehow come up. And I think if there were an issue, I think kids would get, if there were kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people didn't think was important or had no real relevance to their lives, I mean, I think the kids would rally immediately. The issue right now is that there's nothing there. 

Recording: (9224/ 9621) 
 Exactly. I wish I would have taken typing in home ec in high school and I was too busy with college prep and you know what good did that do me? 

Recording: (9225/ 9621) 
 Not really, I mean, there's theological differences that I have. 

Recording: (9226/ 9621) 
 You know at lunchtime they'd be cutting their next class. You know there's two different lunchtimes. Sometimes they just alternate and take two lunches or go to one class, go to one lunch and skip after then. 

Recording: (9227/ 9621) 
 My brother lives in Connecticut and he's with the cement company, concrete. I'm not even really sure. I've never even seen him, where he lives. Seen pictures and he comes and visits a lot but I've never gone up there. And his wife's an opera singer so she's real busy. They just are madly in love. He got divorced after 17 years of marriage and found the wife that he has now. They've been married for probably almost, oh I don't know, seven, eight years. And they're real happy. And his kids are grown and they have kids. And the family's really pretty big. The immediate family, just us, is 32 with our husbands, wives, and kids. So then I have another sister that was married to a doctor and just recently divorced. She's one of the ones that wants to stay home. It's unfair. You know, life is unfair. Nothing ever works. And so she's living in Akron in a house completely paid for by herself and lives out in the middle of nowhere and complains how lonely she is. And I told her if it was me completely alone, I'd be in the middle of a city somewhere, you know, you see people and I don't know you know it's just you can always see what someone else should do or could do. 

Recording: (9228/ 9621) 
 Oh, did you come in? 

Recording: (9229/ 9621) 
 and they don't know any different. 

Recording: (9230/ 9621) 
 Well, yeah. 

Recording: (9231/ 9621) 
 A lot, a lot of people. 

Recording: (9232/ 9621) 
 I mean, it seems to me they're more one-liners. So I'm a little disappointed. I'm sad that the show's going off, that the show's gonna stop, but I'm not as sad because of the product I'm getting now. With The Simpsons, I'm having it being replaced by Futurama, which I find to be absolute genius. So it's not so bad. X-Files, I'm sad but not as sad based on the past couple of scenes. I mean, Deep Space Nine went off the air. That one really bothered me. And I even had a Star Trek replacement. 

Recording: (9233/ 9621) 
 His mother died the week after we got married. She had diabetes, juvenile diabetes, diagnosed at age 11 and just over the years ended up having open heart surgery and didn't make it through the surgery. My grandmother also died during open heart surgery, so my perception of open heart surgery, even though I'm a nurse, it's not very good just because of the two. 

Recording: (9234/ 9621) 
 I certainly wouldn't and would I expect my mom to stay with that in that kind of a situation? No way. I would want her to be happy and I would want my dad to be happy also. So ultimately for that situation I think it was much better. They got married kind of young too and I think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be a little bit more careful. I know that now it's a lot different than it used to be. People would get married and they'd just be expected to stay together and there's a lot of people that have been married for a really long time and they're miserable. 

Recording: (9235/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9236/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9237/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (9238/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9239/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah. 

Recording: (9240/ 9621) 
 Well, I received my notice of drafting, to be drafted, greetings, you're gonna be drafted. But my brother just got back a couple, three years before from Vietnam, so I enlisted in the Air Force. 

Recording: (9241/ 9621) 
 And I would just tell the boys, you know, respect these girls, because they are going to be women. And try to wait. If you love this girl, if you think you love this girl, wait till she go through high school together and stuff. That won't work, but. 

Recording: (9242/ 9621) 
 She's undecided right now. 

Recording: (9243/ 9621) 
 He's in his sophomore year. 

Recording: (9244/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9245/ 9621) 
 All right. 

Recording: (9246/ 9621) 
 Well, both kids went to Catholic schools up through 8th grade and then he wanted to switch to public school. 

Recording: (9247/ 9621) 
 small patio so 

Recording: (9248/ 9621) 
 some different types of courses and those types of things. 

Recording: (9249/ 9621) 
 One of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi. That's not really too hard, but the hardest thing to do is electrical work. I think it's just because it's more intimidating. 

Recording: (9250/ 9621) 
 Or then they had to, after that, they had to lottery number and that wasn't, if you were high, you know, if you got, your number was picked, I mean, I don't know what should be worse, knowing that you're gonna get a notice and being able to prepare for it or, because I've had friends that got numbers and everything, you know, and getting a high number and sitting there going, oh my God. So. 

Recording: (9251/ 9621) 
 Right, right. But during the rest of the year, a lot of times we'll play really, really challenging and interesting band music. And you don't always get the opportunity to do that in musical groups. Sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of what they expect the audience to want to hear. 

Recording: (9252/ 9621) 
 You know, because I just think it looks so awful when you can't even admit to what your opinion is. 

Recording: (9253/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9254/ 9621) 
 Columbus it seems to be. I mean it's just like, whoa. 

Recording: (9255/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and she's adorable. 

Recording: (9256/ 9621) 
 Hahaha 

Recording: (9257/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I hear about suicide rates when they don't get in, but... 

Recording: (9258/ 9621) 
 Me too. 

Recording: (9259/ 9621) 
 Man, I heard housing is tight out there, but that's crazy. 

Recording: (9260/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9261/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (9262/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9263/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9264/ 9621) 
 But people coming from other cities, like Chicago, New York, and places like that, where they were treated poorly by whites, they tended to act differently towards you and everything, until they realized that you weren't like that. We only had one racial incident when I was in the service, where we were a predominantly white platoon, and because we worked in missiles and stuff, you know, so then the security cops were above us and they were predominantly black, you know. And I don't know what happened, something happened one time, there was only like 20 people in our whole platoon, and it was all in the same barracks, and some guy said something off-color to one of them or something like that, you know, and it got kind of out of hand for a while, but, you know, thank God nothing really happened. 

Recording: (9265/ 9621) 
 For fun. We've been playing a lot of pool. 

Recording: (9266/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they don't pay you for any of that stuff. 

Recording: (9267/ 9621) 
 Right, wow. 

Recording: (9268/ 9621) 
 I was too young.

 All right. 

Recording: (9270/ 9621) 
 or that are having kids. And I mean, we talk about, that's all we do is sit in there and talk about our kids and what they're doing and how our parents and them reacted. Like there was this girl that just got in there today and her parents were like flipping out because she's pregnant. And we were all telling her about how, you know, it always starts out that way. And they'll ease up later on. 

Recording: (9271/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9272/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9273/ 9621) 
 I know. 

Recording: (9274/ 9621) 
 at that time in the 30s. 

Recording: (9275/ 9621) 
 Do you want this donor to be this, this, and that? Some people will say that. I feel sorry for those people. I pray for those people. Because prayer is the most powerful thing you can have. It's gonna get you through. Nothing else, I don't care what challenge you have in front of you, you put in his hands, and you have enough faith to practice it, it'll come through. It may not come through the way you think you want it to, but somewhere along the line, you're gonna say, ah, for some reason I'm supposed to do this. I can't explain it, but you're always looking for reasons, you're asking me. I'm looking for reasons, but a lot of times you can't give a reason. It just happens. Why did you marry your husband? How did you meet your husband? How did he come about? How did the passing go to? Explain that to your offspring someday. 

Recording: (9276/ 9621) 
 to help him. 

Recording: (9277/ 9621) 
 Those are, as I think you were implying, those are needs to those people, but they aren't. So how do we correct some of this? I think we've got to cut out a lot of this luxury. We've got to slowly bring, quote, the family back home. And I don't necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man, who cares? In today's work, we're far less agriculturally related. We're more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation. So a man, or let me rephrase that, a woman can do most of the work that is being done outside of the home today versus what they could have done as agricultural people. And so once again, though, that would bring people back to this central family makeup. Just has to be. Communications, communications as it's going, it's irreversible. I think it can be redirected in much in the manner she's speaking. And where does this start? I think it has to start back here in first grade. I think parents must participate with teachers as we used to. It was just common. You could walk in and sit down and watch the students or participate and or assist. Today, they have these assistants, but they're hired, directed, they're not in there Portraying or passing their own their values of the community to the students So I think that's I guess I come I will continue to come back to family to family almost everything has got to be come to family. Bring that family back together and get them to communicate on that personal basis, not that impersonal basis. 

Recording: (9278/ 9621) 
 because they're saying you're still a kid, but yet. 

Recording: (9279/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9280/ 9621) 
 that maybe if it would have stayed small, maybe I could notice some kind of difference that way, but I never, I haven't noticed anything. 

Recording: (9281/ 9621) 
 Mm. 

Recording: (9282/ 9621) 
 I like to watch football. I like OSU. I've never really gotten into anything else, but now he likes the Denver, so I'll watch that with him. I don't really know much about it. 

Recording: (9283/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9284/ 9621) 
 And then there's somebody's house on three acres of land or something. 

Recording: (9285/ 9621) 
 I do. I think they should, you know, if you're open with your kids nowadays, you have to be with everything that's in the world. I mean, my parents never talked to me about drugs or anything. 

Recording: (9286/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I probably will. So you'll be watching her on the commercial breaks and ignoring the actual call? Yeah. 

Recording: (9287/ 9621) 
 I remember when I was married, my ex said, you want to go shopping? What? 

Recording: (9288/ 9621) 
 No, I thought my son. 

Recording: (9289/ 9621) 
 I'm sorry. 

Recording: (9290/ 9621) 
 I think if you're open enough with your children, these parents, and say, you know, we want to give you this option, we prefer you don't do this, but if you decide to do it, we want you to be protected. 

Recording: (9291/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9292/ 9621) 
 I don't know. 

Recording: (9293/ 9621) 
 Uh-oh. 

Recording: (9294/ 9621) 
 He was lucky. 

Recording: (9295/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9296/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we have two computers in our house and they both have internet on them. It's called All Advantage and they'll pay you to go to websites and it's like 25 cent an hour or something, I don't remember what it was. But we haven't got a check yet. 

Recording: (9297/ 9621) 
 so hard. I mean, every summer they have homework that has to be done or else the first grading period is an F. And when my oldest daughter went to Northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there. And once she got into it, she went, oh, maybe not. So I said, well, you know, whatever. So then she wanted to go to because it's basically a Columbus public school that's geared to college only. I mean, if if you're not going to college, don't go there because you will flunk out. It's very hard. And she got in the second year three weeks before school started. And so we go over there and they hand her this stack of material that's got to be done in three weeks. So I thought, well, I'll just call. And I called and I talked to the principal and I said, you know, they gave all this stuff. And, you know, everybody else has had June, July, August to get this done. And she's got three weeks. And she goes, and the principal goes, that's correct. And I go, well, there's no way she can get this done. And I said, you know, everybody else has had all this time. And she's going to get it done in three weeks. And they go, that's right. So they take, there's no excuses, you know. And it is very hard. I know my youngest daughter, who is just as smart as my oldest, would do horrible there because, you know, basically they say, we're talking about China this week, and on December the 15th, we want to report on why Chinese people do what they do. You know, and it's like, and every week they don't come by and go, have you started? Have you started? Have you started? Do you have the outline? Right. And it's up to you to go, gosh, I have to have an outline. I have to have a bibliography. I have to have the facts. I have to interview some people. And if you don't sit down with a little calendar and go, this week I'm getting this done, this week I'm getting this done, this, you just fail. So my oldest daughter is pretty detail oriented. So after we kind of helped her start, you know, and say, you know, you're, you're going to have to do these things so you get this done, I said, and basically get it done like two weeks before it's done. So then you can say, oh, this isn't very good and amend it or whatever or help somebody, get somebody with typing or whatever. So she's really good. And it's helped her at school a lot because I know she toured here here to Ohio State and there were some people here that would come from Cause and they go, this will be easier than your high school. 

Recording: (9298/ 9621) 
 I'm like, I don't remember that. 

Recording: (9299/ 9621) 
 I know it. 

Recording: (9300/ 9621) 
 You're like, no, he's back there trying to shoot me, you know? I remember hearing horror stories, you know, about people just dying, you know, left and right, just like, you know, just dropping, just to get out of East Germany. And they don't play. They do shoot to kill. And just now, just to walk back and forth, it's amazing. 

Recording: (9301/ 9621) 
 right. 

Recording: (9302/ 9621) 
 We had one of the parties up there and they had this big pyramid shaped thing. I forget what they call it. It's like a crystal or something. I don't know. But they have a speaker hook up to it and the structure of it makes the sound resonate like crazy. They have subwoofers sitting under it and there's this bed in the middle. So I ended up falling asleep there one night. Somebody woke me up with the music. 

Recording: (9303/ 9621) 
 She, there's our wanderlust right there. She travels all the time. 

Recording: (9304/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah. 

Recording: (9305/ 9621) 
 how to do it so I think that would probably be about the biggest difference is just really the amount of education you get 

Recording: (9306/ 9621) 
 You can't, especially with kids, it's just too overwhelming. 

Recording: (9307/ 9621) 
 Really? Why? Just because it's close to Japan? 

Recording: (9308/ 9621) 
 I was more comfortable here than in high school. You don't see like the big cliques like the popular Abercrombie wearing people or like all the art students hanging out together. It's a big mix of people and everyone's doing their own thing. 

Recording: (9309/ 9621) 
 Well, I'm very much in favor of gun control, very strong gun control. They just seem to be too available. I've done some of the things that the schools are doing about it. The kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets suspended. That's a little much, but... 

Recording: (9310/ 9621) 
 I think that's great. I think obviously there's always a downside, but I think that too many people abuse the system. And unfortunately, it's very hard when then it ruins it for the people who really do need it. But as long as they have created a system whereby it won't be obviously as good for those people as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployable. But I think depending on how sort of focused they are on the individuals in their area or whatever, however it's divided up, I don't know, hopefully not special treatment, but obviously you would try to steer them more in whichever direction they're most suited for as far as maybe like far as maybe like the volunteer work, because I mean, you know, there's so much volunteering to be done everywhere, and even if you don't have, you know, if you're lacking in whatever way, you think that you can, you know, there is something, you know, hopefully that, I don't know, 

Recording: (9311/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9312/ 9621) 
 Well, Teeter's a school board member for Columbus. 

Recording: (9313/ 9621) 
 To learn about God. He doesn't know anything about God right now, I don't think at all. 

Recording: (9314/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9315/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9316/ 9621) 
 You might think I'm an idiot, but you know what I mean? The next person walks in the door, might be real good. 

Recording: (9317/ 9621) 
 What I don't understand is with the construction, they start everywhere. You'd think that you would start one area, you put a whole bunch of people and they'd work real fast and they'd get that done. And then they'd move on. But it's like every single place in the city's got like four guys working. And you think, what the hell are you doing over there? 

Recording: (9318/ 9621) 
 a week. 

Recording: (9319/ 9621) 
 I don't think I can answer that. 

Recording: (9320/ 9621) 
 We're animals. Everyone's looking for leaders. It's the rules of the church. Simple as a rule. 

Recording: (9321/ 9621) 
 But, well, something's happening, of course, to the planet on weather patterns, and they've been having droughts in Oregon, which is so strange. But when I was there, it rains from November through June. It rains. I mean, they say on the weather in the morning, showers changing to rain, and then the next day they say rain changing to showers. And it does have, but they don't use umbrellas. I mean, they just go through it. They're just so used to it, and they wear that kind of jacket, you know, because it's not a hard rain. And the first year I was there, it was pretty hard to get used to it, there's no cold real cold winter and and then from July, August, September, October it's just gorgeous just so gorgeous but I like I like that fog and that mist and those evergreen trees. 

Recording: (9322/ 9621) 
 Yeah, pretty good for secretarial, administrative type work. I mean, everybody's always looking for that. 

Recording: (9323/ 9621) 
 You know, because you're learning more about yourself and you're also learning more about, like, you're experiencing a lot of freedoms that you didn't have, obviously. You know, you're driving. 

Recording: (9324/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it was. It's not bothering me, but when I talk and move my head. 

Recording: (9325/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9326/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Very much so. 

Recording: (9327/ 9621) 
 But it wasn't the worry about getting pregnant, it was the worry about getting AIDS. 

Recording: (9328/ 9621) 
 And she said, it's amazing you can give people numbers and they immediately use them wrong. They just don't know how to use them. They completely misinterpret it, even though it's very clearly stated what they're doing. And the newspapers do that a lot, too. 

Recording: (9329/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9330/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (9331/ 9621) 
 Yeah.

 Yeah, yeah.

 It only took, the last one I did was on Richards Road, which is right across from Whetstone Park. 

Recording: (9336/ 9621) 
 Um... 

Recording: (9337/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9338/ 9621) 
 Yeah, drugs, right. Yeah, so that's what she's interested in right now. She's looking to see if she can find some place to work this summer. Even if it's just a day a week, some clinic or something, just to see what goes on day to day. 

Recording: (9339/ 9621) 
 I never knew they had so many beaches. I mean, I know they had a good reputation, you know, for like just having a great vacation time. Because nobody ever came back from Australia and said, oh yeah, the place was terrible, you know, the weather was bad, you know, that people were rude. Everybody, they said, oh, you gotta go, you gotta go. You know, it's a long flight, but it's well worth the time. 

Recording: (9340/ 9621) 
 Where? 

Recording: (9341/ 9621) 
 cumulonimbus or whatever, you know. And, you know, he was pretty much pissed off the rest of the way up there because I was right. 

Recording: (9342/ 9621) 
 My answer to your question is, has this eroded? I'm going to answer using the word respect. Yes, I feel that this has eroded over time. There's not the respect for our elders. I don't necessarily mean elders in terms of the chronological age, but I'm talking in terms of generations. There's less respect for the father, less respect for the mother, less respect for the grandparents and the great-grandparents. I'm going to give you a first-hand example. I just had a conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now 20. She will come over to my house, Grandpa's house, and she'll come in and she'll flop down in a chair and she will do nothing in that household, even if you suggest it. I don't ever tell her to do things. And I've pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa or great grandfather, if we saw weeds out in the garden, we went out and we hoed the garden. If the chicken house needed to be cleaned and they hadn't gotten to it that day, we went out and cleaned the chicken house. We would say, grandpa, is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken house? Well, of course, you knew very well it was gonna be okay. But a matter of respect, though, you ask, is it okay for us to do it? And now, with her, I can have dishes out there in the sink that are left there from breakfast and maybe lunch, and she'll walk out there and I'll say, well, Grandpa, how come your dishes aren't done? And then she turns around and walks away. You're looking for something to eat, you know? That's right. And she may then go ahead and say, well, sometimes she'll ask, sometimes she doesn't. But let's assume she did. She asked, is it all right if I have some of this? She goes ahead and gets the dishes out and so forth. She puts them right in there in that sink with those other dishes, makes no efforts to clean them. And I've seen this in many, many, many incidents, but I'm giving you this is very firsthand. I know this, and I strongly suspect that this is a typical, typical thing in our society today. So yes, in my opinion, definitely it's eroding. I know you took a little different approach in answering the question from over the time that this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect. I I'll expect you to be able to know what to do. But I mean, I never did. And I know, well, I won't give you any examples. But anyway, if I told them they couldn't do it, I would try them. Swearing is one of my bad habits. And I know that I would try very, very hard. I got taught one time that I better watch a little more carefully by my own little girl. But anyway, I would always, and I would apologize. If they did catch me doing something, I'd be telling them, no, you can't do that. I I mean, now, if you want to hear the story, funny, well, the TV just sees that I was baking a pie, and I was taking this pie out of the oven. It was a cherry pie or an apple pie. Well, it was getting juicy sometimes, and I hadn't put any aluminum foil in there either to catch it. And just as I started to get it out, I spilled it. And I said a bad word, you know. And just as I said that word, leaning down here, there's two little shoes. And I just sit there for a minute before I take it out. I take it on out, sit on top of the line. I said, well, Mommy said a bad word. I guess that Mommy has to have soap on her feet. I Yep, so I go to the bathroom. I thought I always told you to tell the kids to stick your tongue out. And I just put a little bit of soap on the end of their tongue. Well, now I've been, I've had false teeth since I was about 32. Needless to say, I had false teeth when this kid did this. You were not five years old. Go in the bathroom, I sit down on that toilet stool, and I sit there, I stick out my tongue. She takes that cake of soap. She doesn't rub my tongue, she twists it. Takes off my teeth. And she doesn't always use the teeth. Two weeks, get that soap taste off my teeth. No matter how I scrub. Need many older folks right now I don't think because of two people have to work outside the house She just used the word penalty government, people, and everybody that's let's come back to about the middle. I'm concerned that we are getting away from penalties completely. And I feel it's absolutely essential that we have penalties. We have for everyone, for everyone, really across the board. We are getting away from penalties. We're getting away from penalties. But so many people, just to give an example, talking about adults, I just read a statistic the other day right here, City of Columbus, where there was an extremely high percent, I can't quote the percentages, of people who ignore yellow lights. And of consequence, they are ending up going through red lights. And there are many, many, many accidents taking place. And it used to be that you could place a law enforcement officer at the corner. If it happened, he immediately would penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the court as the case may be. Well, now we have passed so many little ordinances and laws and changed the enforcement policies and this kind of thing. With a poor police officer, he can't even do that any longer. He's got, if somebody runs through a red light, you almost have to hit somebody and then be accused for going through the red light. He can't just arbitrarily be there because that's called, I think the word harassment plays a part. You are harassing that individual because you are standing there waiting for him to commit this problem. Let's just get away from that example. You can talk about whether you were carrying, I don't want to get into the guns and knives and stuff in the school. 

Recording: (9343/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I think a lot of times people aren't real rational as far as who they go for. 

Recording: (9344/ 9621) 
 It was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent in exchange for having me all to herself. 

Recording: (9345/ 9621) 
 Not at all. 

Recording: (9346/ 9621) 
 their IDs. I mean, the guys are trying to look older, the girls are trying to look younger. 

Recording: (9347/ 9621) 
 I think because of the movies and I think of Nintendo and all those games that they have on there, I think that really does spark things in little children's minds and even, you know, like in junior high that, oh yeah, we could do that, you know. And there's just so much violence and when we were growing up, there wasn't any violence on TV. We were allowed to watch it. But you know what I mean? I mean, the comics weren't violent. Now it's too open for kids. They say the parents should monitor them. 

Recording: (9348/ 9621) 
 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 

Recording: (9349/ 9621) 
 And from downstairs, we broke into my computer. 

Recording: (9350/ 9621) 
 They just, I'm not sure really what they do. 

Recording: (9351/ 9621) 
 I don't know. 

Recording: (9352/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my kids were both two weeks late, so I know how that is. 

Recording: (9353/ 9621) 
 Um, 

Recording: (9354/ 9621) 
 Okay. 

Recording: (9355/ 9621) 
 It's kind of a neat place, isn't it? 

Recording: (9356/ 9621) 
 I guess so. I hope that they can keep the school somehow for kids. But it won't be him running it. 

Recording: (9357/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9358/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. Here. 

Recording: (9359/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9360/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9361/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9362/ 9621) 
 Somebody must have been watching over me. 

Recording: (9363/ 9621) 
 Anybody see this? 

Recording: (9364/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (9365/ 9621) 
 There's a lot of, I don't know, how the training is done with some of these animals. Some of them are treated very cruelly. 

Recording: (9366/ 9621) 
 I haven't seen any fights, I haven't seen anyone get shot. I mean, you read about it in the lantern, but the only thing that I was really shocked about was the people begging on High Street. 

Recording: (9367/ 9621) 
 No, it was just the usual things. She touched my things. Because they were far apart enough, they had their own social groups. They had their own friends and interests, so there wasn't much of that. But it was the usual, you know. She's breathing on me in the car. He's humming too loud. I don't know if you've got brothers and sisters, but yeah, you've probably went through it all. Yeah, well there were five of us and a lot of that. 

Recording: (9368/ 9621) 
 But you know what I mean? He was about nine years old, but he's known me all my life. So you know what I mean? It wasn't no big shock. 

Recording: (9369/ 9621) 
 Heh. 

Recording: (9370/ 9621) 
 that they fired him like that the night before the Michigan game. So then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora, you know, a hat. He looked so cool. You know, because Joe Paterno, he always wears a tie. I don't know. He just, he's a great coach. 

Recording: (9371/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and this is something I've thought about a lot because if I had stayed in Cincinnati, say, where it's very conservative, you know, not real open to new things, or if I had stayed on the East Coast where, of course, it would be really competitive, I probably wouldn't be working as a freelancer today. I came to Columbus. There wasn't, you know, there wasn't much going on when I came here. 

Recording: (9372/ 9621) 
 Oh, really? 

Recording: (9373/ 9621) 
 Yeah, it is. She doesn't even drive to work. 

Recording: (9374/ 9621) 
 and we were stopped at one of their defensive lines. 

Recording: (9375/ 9621) 
 But then you'll have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery. 

Recording: (9376/ 9621) 
 you know, we'll go places, you know. 

Recording: (9377/ 9621) 
 I'm not that old yet. I might look it. 

Recording: (9378/ 9621) 
 They don't have rabies. 

Recording: (9379/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It surprises me to find that Columbus is so out of shape. But I'm in the, well, you know, in the circles that I move in, everybody is middle-aged and they all quit smoking and they're all of a sudden trying to beat off the reaper. And so, you know, I mean, well, and of course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and twigs and leaves anyway, you know, so that's the sort of circles I move in. But I know because I have these part-time jobs from time to time, I see a whole different group of people. And I can say it's probably true. 

Recording: (9380/ 9621) 
 Hmm. 

Recording: (9381/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9382/ 9621) 
 Just 

Recording: (9383/ 9621) 
 So once you convince people that there's nothing to be scared of here, and there's nothing to be scared of there, then they start to play. And once you start playing, you start learning. 

Recording: (9384/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9385/ 9621) 
 And much and much other things, you know that I'm coming to understand 

Recording: (9386/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9387/ 9621) 
 We didn't know anything about what he did. We found out more after he died. 

Recording: (9388/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9389/ 9621) 
 you 

Recording: (9390/ 9621) 
 Yeah, yeah, that's another thing I hear about that. 

Recording: (9391/ 9621) 
 You know, they never ask for extra money. And they had to cut back on everything. And I think it just set people back. Now we're trying real hard to catch up. And at some point, we're going to have to put a levy on again. And who knows what's happened. We're keeping Rosa Smith right now because she's so good PR with the business community. But the business community in Columbus doesn't really support the schools. They don't. I mean, we've got two new stadiums and we haven't got any increase in school funding. 

Recording: (9392/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but my oldest, she's the oldest. She's got three kids. One, her oldest is by a different guy and her new husband adopted her. Cause she never sees him. And then they got two other girls. And they live together, they got a house. They're going through marriage. They've been together for like five years and they're not doing very well right now, but hopefully they'll get over that. And then I got an older brother who him and his girlfriend moved in together and they just had a baby. 

Recording: (9393/ 9621) 
 So they, I have OSU insurance but I had no doctor at the time and they wanted to admit me. They told me they were going to make me wait two months before they did anything. And what I did, I had my wife drive me down to the hospital and I crawled out of the car and crawled into the hospital until they either admit me or I crawl out the door. 

Recording: (9394/ 9621) 
 Yeah and it's been five years this year that we've been married and close to seven that I've known him so and it's still just as exciting it's still just as good and he amazes me every day because I'm I'm one oh this won't last forever but you know and he's like well when we're 90 you know you'll know so 

Recording: (9395/ 9621) 
 So he finally decided, you know, after, oh, well, when he was in Catholic school, they kept his desk in the hallway, you know. 

Recording: (9396/ 9621) 
 So what do you do if I don't know what to believe about something, I'll go and I'll find an answer for myself. I'm not going to take somebody else's answer. And if I do take someone else people who do, but I know a lot of people who don't. Do the theological discussions? No, no, unless you're seeking that out. I mean, I go to the Vineyard Church. It's up in Westerville, and there's about probably 6,000 of us. It's one of the biggest churches in Ohio. If you want to find something in that church, you can find it. You can find a discussion group about anything. It's just a matter of finding it. Within any denomination or within any religion, you go as deep as you want to go. There are people who just go on Sunday mornings. There are people who just go on Easter, there are people who go Monday, Wednesday, Tuesday, and Sunday nights and Saturday nights and are of Bible understanding, what do are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten that that's what the original, that's what a Christian's supposed to do. And that's what our church does. 

Recording: (9397/ 9621) 
 Wow. 

Recording: (9398/ 9621) 
 And that's actually a really interesting thing too, because especially coming back, you know, and moving all my stuff out of storage, I've just been on this, you know, I'm getting rid of half of everything I own because over there it's, you know, it just feels so weird to come back and I feel so loaded down, especially when I've spent so much time just living out of a suitcase. You know, I just really realize I have so much stuff that I don't need because there, you know, everyone has just sort little closet with clothes. There isn't stuff all around. Everything's more expensive so everyone has a lot less. And here it's like everything is so relatively inexpensive that it's like picture frames or something there, it might be $25 for one. So you buy one here, oh, they're $5 a piece, let's buy five. 

Recording: (9399/ 9621) 
 and that's what I'm saying, atoning for sins. It's quite a hypocrisy when you get a church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when what they did. I mean, in the church in Zanesville where I went and buried my grandparents and went through all my life, over the door of the church was a picture of Christopher Columbus with a missionary, a priest, and all his men with his sword drawn, a dead Native American at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear. Now I ask the priest a cold hard question. 

Recording: (9400/ 9621) 
 I get wick, that is it. 

Recording: (9401/ 9621) 
 So I had some family responsibilities. We were always, my brother and I and my sisters were active in the 4-H clubs. 

Recording: (9402/ 9621) 
 Huh. 

Recording: (9403/ 9621) 
 That's awesome, there's a lot of stuff to do down there. If you like outdoors. I bet. 

Recording: (9404/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (9405/ 9621) 
 The university never has money. That's like me when I first came here. The university was not paying me nothing. I worked two jobs for 10 years while I was here, the first 10 years, just to make a living. 

Recording: (9406/ 9621) 
 And he did that too. 

Recording: (9407/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9408/ 9621) 
 simply because it's not too much of a change from the status quo. 

Recording: (9409/ 9621) 
 And like even the people the maybe their apartments didn't look as impressive, but they were making money 

Recording: (9410/ 9621) 
 Hehe 

Recording: (9411/ 9621) 
 things, you know, collecting, but it's hard with my sister's cats because she has a little girl and no, she didn't go home vacuum every day, you know, but. 

Recording: (9412/ 9621) 
 the life. 

Recording: (9413/ 9621) 
 Yeah, and I think it could work, but I don't think people are ready to accept it. And if the people who are given the information aren't ready to accept it, then...

 Well, you're in a high-tech society. Most people, you said you're from New York, right? Your family's where? 

Recording: (9417/ 9621) 
 Mmm. 

Recording: (9418/ 9621) 
 I mean, I. 

Recording: (9419/ 9621) 
 I think so. 

Recording: (9420/ 9621) 
 Well, they only keep them there for a day or so, and then they try to intervene with their family and put them back with their family, or maybe call in children's services. And I just really don't think much of children's services. 

Recording: (9421/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I don't know where they're going now, but 

Recording: (9422/ 9621) 
 you

 See you tomorrow. I mean hold them, feel the warmth of the body, hear the conversation quietly rather than hearing, OK, time to get out of here, you know, with a vigorous thing, but a pleasant sort of remark. These kind, I could elaborate, I could write a whole book on that, on this, on the answer to your questions. But it's these kinds of things are very elementary really They're very elementary I guess to our rage group, but maybe not so sure that maybe the baby boomers that wouldn't be elementary at all Going back to your question about the baby boomers. I still think they were I don't think they're causing it about that I think it was a happenstance with that group, but it's a massive group very 

Recording: (9424/ 9621) 
 Ugh. 

Recording: (9425/ 9621) 
 Oh, I think that's good. 

Recording: (9426/ 9621) 
 I can see that. Like I said, for me, I kind of stay where I am. It's not that I really travel out into some of those other areas more. It doesn't really affect me personally. Maybe that's bad. I don't know. Maybe I should feel guilty about that. 

Recording: (9427/ 9621) 
 That's all I understand is money. 

Recording: (9428/ 9621) 
 My thesis is on the Sudeten Germans. Those are the Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the Second World War. And specifically I'm looking at how they perceived their condition switching from being part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Germans being sort of the majority, even though they weren't the majority, but sort of the master nation within the Austro-Hungarian Empire to becoming a minority within Czechoslovakia. 

Recording: (9429/ 9621) 
 There is, very definitely. 

Recording: (9430/ 9621) 
 Yeah, they was burning couches and over by Pearl Alley, they was actually rolling a Volkswagen down the alley. Man, there was all kinds of people doing it.

 My mom teaches there, so it's free tuition. I get a tuition waiver. 

Recording: (9438/ 9621) 
 you know that's a possibility. You're not supposed to carry that much money around. And it's as much to protect the people after you as it is to protect you. Because the word has to get out that we don't have that much money. It doesn't pay. Yeah. 

Recording: (9439/ 9621) 
 You know, always something going on. 

Recording: (9440/ 9621) 
 Personally, I think it's too late because they can get things on the internet. You know, there's just so many things, so many avenues for them to find violence and pornography and, you know, things that we, you know, when I was growing up, we just, there was no way I could see any of that stuff. I had good parents, but I was into, you know, Lassie and Tom and Jer. I mean, you know, these, but, you know, they weren't violent and they made you feel good after you watched them. But I just think, I don't think it could turn back right now. I don't know. 

Recording: (9441/ 9621) 
 No, the lifestyle was very easy to fit into and I've always been interested in sort of like to the whole European culture before I went there. But I think the most difficult was actually because I was studying English when I went there. And studying English here is a dime a dozen and studying English in England is sort of, I don't know, more sort of elitist, which I didn't realize before I got there. So I was in all these courses. I was the only American. The classes were really small. And I definitely got a feeling. And there were a few classes that really stood out where there was sort of, I'd have to say something or I'd have to give a presentation or something and it was sort of like, what does this American know? That was the hardest thing, is the way I was treated by some of my peers in classes. I mean, not directly, they'd never say anything terrible to you or anything, but it was just sort of that feeling of, 

Recording: (9442/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9443/ 9621) 
 So they get more buying power if they go there, okay. 

Recording: (9444/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9445/ 9621) 
 Right, right.

 and was threatening kids with it, and so they suspended him. 

Recording: (9447/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean... 

Recording: (9448/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9449/ 9621) 
 He does. And his music is extremely good. He taught himself. By 16, he's playing eight instruments very well. And he can't do that now where he lives. He lives with, this is another thing that boggles my mind, his girlfriend's mother. He's afraid his girlfriend, her daughter, was going to run away, so she lets them sleep together in their house when her daughter was 14. 

Recording: (9450/ 9621) 
 when he was one just for one minute. My mother taught me that. I don't stand him in the corner. 

Recording: (9451/ 9621) 
 That's huge. 

Recording: (9452/ 9621) 
 Really? 

Recording: (9453/ 9621) 
 But I want them to do that to me. And I think if you could teach your kids that and get back to teaching them the same thing on those radio programs and TV programs instead of what they're showing right now, I think the world would be a lot of place, a lot better place. And long to the politicians, if they stop saying now what's really best for the general public instead of what we think to make ourselves look great. 

Recording: (9454/ 9621) 
 There's lots of theater. And the third thing would be, we got restaurants. 

Recording: (9455/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9456/ 9621) 
 Well I can tell you some community bands that could use ya. Oh really? Yeah! 

Recording: (9457/ 9621) 
 I'm retired. 

Recording: (9458/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean it's like it's known, but it's in a different way. It's like a different type of fame than like traditional style, so It's like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like like it's more of like a It's not like an MTV type thing, you know

 and he was the assistant manager of a video game store I worked at in high school. 

Recording: (9460/ 9621) 
 She's wonderful, but back then, they were, it was the 60s and they were hippies and you know, my mom's got long jet black hair and they're wearing their army outfits and whatever, you know, everybody's got bell bottoms. My dad's got long hair down to here and everything. So they lived like 17th Avenue for a while and we lived, like I said, on Summit until I was about three years old and then they split up for a little bit and got back together and my mom and I lived someplace on campus in just a little one room apartment. It was just she and I and I would go see my dad on the weekends which was great for me. I mean everybody, my dad and I would do fun stuff, my mom and I would do fun stuff and I never remember it being negative. 

Recording: (9461/ 9621) 
 I definitely, I mean, I think I went to like kindergarten in a public school so I don't really know too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do. But I know, I mean, as far as going to a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that, that I'm doing now is stuff I already covered in high school so I already have a basis for it. 

Recording: (9462/ 9621) 
 Yeah, that's what it seems. I mean, I know it's like I mean, it's the same proportion I mean there are more old people there, but it just seems more apparent just because of how But you can't like go outside all the time. Yeah, I mean, there's never like three or four months where you just want to sit in your house and 

Recording: (9463/ 9621) 
 You know, it's like, look, you always think I could, you know, look, I'm doing really well. Look how wonderful everything is. 

Recording: (9464/ 9621) 
 I think the news media have hyped it up too much, really. I mean, we have an accord with Cuba that says anyone that's trying to escape from Cuba to the United States that's found at sea is immediately returned to Cuba. Whether you agree with it or not, that's the accord. And that's what Castro's, that's the premise he's operating on. And the news media, they haven't really been, they just haven't been real objective about it. I mean, you know, like there are two fishermen that found him at sea. You never hear about the other one because this was on one, just briefly I heard on the news, because he thinks he should go back to his father, but you don't hear about him. There's three cousins. Two of them think he should stay in Miami. The other one thinks he should go back with his father. You don't hear about him. I was reading about him in Newsweek or someplace. So I think the news media has not been totally objective about this. 

Recording: (9465/ 9621) 
 You know, stuff like that. It's kind of neat because you don't have to pay, well you have to pay for it, but like magazines. 

Recording: (9466/ 9621) 
 But we still need to have property management records. That's very essential. And a lot of times when you're talking to engineers, they don't realize that part of it. They don't like the detail, at least that aspect of it. But we need to have a lot of that because you need to know how your facilities are structured, the time history, any type of activity on that, whether it's been installed, removed, relocated, wherever it might be. But we need to know that how it has an impact upon the design of a particular facility voice and data. 

Recording: (9467/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I mean, like, it just, it provides a window of opportunity for those who really do work, like. 

Recording: (9468/ 9621) 
 three years. I have them, usually I have them sixth, seventh, and eighth for those language arts subjects unless they get some miraculous cure and they get phased out. Like right now I'm phasing an eighth grader out and into the regular English. But he worked really, really hard and he's very bright and he's still a terrible speller, but he is not lazy and he does his assignments and as long as you clearly explain to him what he's supposed to do and he's a good writer and usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context, you know, so we're in the process of phasing him out so that he won't have to, he's had help I think since he was in kindergarten. That's the other thing that's really an enigma about these kids. 90% of the time their IQ is like 115 to 130. I mean they're very bright but yet something isn't 

Recording: (9469/ 9621) 
 I know the way we dressed and everything was kind of appalling to the parents and everything. I guess maybe that's where I'm coming from. The way some of the kids dress, retro back to with the bell bottoms and everything to us. The piercings, I just can't get into that. And some of the girls, I mean, they, you know, I mean, my guy, they, 14, 6, 15 years old, they look like they're 20-some years old, you know, and that's what they want to look like. Plus, you watch some of these stupid shows on TV, you know, and you sit there and go, man, I couldn't, my daughter don't do that, you know, when she's around me. Now, when she's away from me, I don't know what the hell she does.

Recording: (9472/ 9621) 
 because I become unpopular if I have like any time away from my girlfriend. 

Recording: (9473/ 9621) 
 There's, you know, just, I had three spiritual leaders tell me that a great gift came with that. That there was, it was no accident. It was supposed to happen. And there's a word called synchronicity. 

Recording: (9474/ 9621) 
 Well, and especially in my situation, you know, I think about it quite a bit, you know, if I would have had more of an opportunity to have a one-on-one relationship with her, I probably, being a girl, you know, could have probably helped her out in a lot of social things, you know, about men. Because I kind of get the impression that she don't really, she still ain't very interested in men, you know, so. Which is her thing, you know. So. 

Recording: (9475/ 9621) 
 Right. 

Recording: (9476/ 9621) 
 Just let people make their own mistakes, but don't make me pay for it. 

Recording: (9477/ 9621) 
 Like, mostly because we had time, but if you had time and money, you'd be able to do the tourist things. 

Recording: (9478/ 9621) 
 Oh yeah, I was never going to get married again. I had my house, my kids, I had already done that. I was financially secure and I wasn't even looking. One of my best friends though at the time, she saw this guy, he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing. And I talked to this girl every day and she was like, oh you have to meet him, you have to meet him. I was like, oh, call me tomorrow, I don't want to meet anybody. So it took a long time for us to be introduced. But then as soon as we were, she was right. I mean, we were like inseparable from probably two weeks after we met. We just, I haven't been without him. So. 

Recording: (9479/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9480/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he's got energy. Yeah. 

Recording: (9481/ 9621) 
 Exactly right yeah, yeah, and you know a lot of people I work with don't see that and you know they think I'm a real cheapskate You know because you know I will I spend money You know it well. I I'm very selective I mean like I'd love to go to Disney World and there are people work that would not go to Disney World just because of what it cost to get in you know now I drive there I don't fly because I'm really that cheap, but you know I'd love to fly, but I just go oh my gosh, and you know, but you know I will do, we don't buy a butterball turkey, we buy a mire. And it's just as good, and we make do. 

Recording: (9482/ 9621) 
 For me, it seems like I have a Midwestern sort of humor, which works best in the Midwest. I have some East Coast clientele, but when I go to Florida, 

Recording: (9483/ 9621) 
 No idea. 

Recording: (9484/ 9621) 
 Yeah, well we didn't find out. We had a, I don't know, we figured we'd just wait and be surprised. Is that what you guys did? 

Recording: (9485/ 9621) 
 I think so. I mean, there's enough open-minded people in the country. 

Recording: (9486/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9487/ 9621) 
 They are, but it seems like they're going out instead of having, we don't do things in hotels and things because they have in-house. 

Recording: (9488/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9489/ 9621) 
 Oh my gosh. 

Recording: (9490/ 9621) 
 I mean, like, what's his name, who wrote the book? 

Recording: (9491/ 9621) 
 They're covered, but it was real tricky because she sort of had some, she was a US citizen. She fell in love through email over the internet back in the early, like 1990, it was real early. And went over there and married the guy. And so she had some of the medical problems and she immigrated and it was just, it took years to get that straightened out. But she's covered now.

 We're using his aunt right now. I mean, she stays home with her daughter and she's got one on the way and so she watches him while I'm in school. It's not a long period of time, only there until 10 o'clock. 

Recording: (9494/ 9621) 
 I just haven't enjoyed it. Before then I was fine. I made a mistake by playing for that one job. I just wanted to get something different because I didn't want to go back where I was. I would have been better off back where I was. I would have been better at the job for one thing. And I knew the kind of insanity I'd be dealing with there. 

Recording: (9495/ 9621) 
 That's fine.

 I don't get on it, but I mean, it's there.

 Mm-hmm.

 like one of my friends who had the apartment in Arlington. 

Recording: (9499/ 9621) 
 It's really beautiful out there. We like mountains and walking around. We got married in Lake Tahoe, which is really beautiful. 

Recording: (9500/ 9621)

 which they have to. 

Recording: (9506/ 9621) 
 If they had a way to cure it, then fine, but leave that up to the people. 

Recording: (9507/ 9621) 
 I tried volunteering, you know, picking them up, doing a volunteer thing. And I'd get calls all during the night to go pick these kids up because I thought I was doing something to help. But, you know, you're not helping them. 

Recording: (9508/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9509/ 9621) 
 I just go back and copycat something she said, picking up that child and cuddling it, and having that baby touch your skin, and teaching what love is. You don't necessarily teach love by words, but just by the feel. That child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother, little brother and the little sister, all of those. Now you say, teach that? Well, my God, didn't they know that when they first came into this classroom? No, not today, not today. I dare say that the vast majority, and I mean above 50, well above 50% when I say that, I'm not being arbitrary, students in high school today probably haven't had their mother or their father truly hold them and hug them rather than just saying, hi Johnny, bye. 

Recording: (9510/ 9621) 
 Das ist gut. 

Recording: (9511/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9512/ 9621) 
 You're talking to people all over the country. I mean, you're becoming more diversified because you get thoughts and opinions from people from all across the world. 

Recording: (9513/ 9621) 
 the lawyers, the judges, everybody that works in that system. I don't care who they are. There isn't an honest one in it. I don't care. There isn't an honest one in it. They might think they are. But once you expose yourself to corruption, you take that in with you.

 Yeah, I'll be starting in 2003. 

Recording: (9517/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9518/ 9621) 
 XD 

Recording: (9519/ 9621) 
 I mean that probably couldn't be proven. I don't know. If anybody would do any decent studies on it, I just bet you a million dollars that it would be the influence of TV. And then another thing, well TV is where it comes from, but the kids are all into Pokemon right now. 

Recording: (9520/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I've been here pretty much all my life until just recent weeks when I moved up to Delaware. It's a real comfort for me because everybody pretty much around where we used to live just, you know, it gets worse and worse. 

Recording: (9521/ 9621) 
 Yeah, go in there and find out, you know, is the kid being abused? If the kid's being abused, you know, take them out. You know, forget the parents' rights, you know. Or, you know, if they're using drugs, put them somewhere, you know, and get them, you know, get them in rehab, you know, and keep them there. You know, just don't throw them there for three days and then throw them out. It's a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes where nothing's getting accomplished. 

Recording: (9522/ 9621) 
 Mhm. 

Recording: (9523/ 9621) 
 Doesn't bother me at all. 

Recording: (9524/ 9621) 
 I'm going to be a teacher. Going into business for myself, I need something to sell and selling my own time doesn't actually seem to be a worthwhile endeavor. I've done it. I've already done independent consulting. I set up a contract and said, hi, you pay me, I'll do this thing and I go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that. The problem is you get taxed obscenely like that because you don't have an employer paying half your taxes for you. And there's other bunches of overhead involved and there's the constant cycle of marketing oneself and it all depends on how much you want to market yourself. Marketing yourself is easier for some people than for others and it's more fun for some people than for others. So, so far I don't know if I 

Recording: (9525/ 9621) 
 That whole thing. 

Recording: (9526/ 9621) 
 Yeah, I guess they do. I don't know where it is or how many. 

Recording: (9527/ 9621) 
 I think it's too late. I do. 

Recording: (9528/ 9621) 
 and call her Tammy when she's little. 

Recording: (9529/ 9621) 
 back there block. So it's right near a lot of other student housing. 

Recording: (9530/ 9621) 
 No, they always have a way to get you out of the car and, you know, like they'll order a pizza for some place that's dark. They'll be waiting there for you. Yeah, yeah. So that's, yeah. 

Recording: (9531/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9532/ 9621) 
 Now. 

Recording: (9533/ 9621) 
 Oh, no, I don't feel that at all. We don't hesitate to get together with other friends and take our kids places. I don't remember my dad doing that stuff. Two or three dads get together and take six kids to the park or something. I don't remember things like that. It could have been there maybe. 

Recording: (9534/ 9621) 
 Right. That's good. 

Recording: (9535/ 9621) 
 Oh. 

Recording: (9536/ 9621) 
 I'm gonna let him choose. I really am. I think as long I mean, I really don't care What religion he is I mean with my husband I really didn't care if he turned Catholic or not I do think religion is important and whatever that religion is to him and he has a place to go to pray to be with his family and other people I Think that's important If he wants to be Catholic, great. If he doesn't, that's okay, too. 

Recording: (9537/ 9621) 
 but and the parent left it in the top drawer of a tool shed that was locked and the kid knew where the key was, he climbed up on a ladder, unlocked it, and he ended up shooting himself with it. I mean, as far as that goes, there's really nothing more he can do. 

Recording: (9538/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9539/ 9621) 
 Projects were right from infancy where I was designing the project. First of all, we had to find out what we had with the vesture. As everyone should know, even as a residential user, you have to know what you have in your house. The telephone company doesn't provide the service to you anymore. We had to know what we had throughout the state of Ohio and some 88 counties and wherever else, the number of facilities we had. So we went on a scavenger hunt. 

Recording: (9540/ 9621) 
 the lack of discipline at the home. 

Recording: (9541/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9542/ 9621) 
 Right. Well, that's something I've noticed in the local news, particularly lately. They say exclusively on our channel and stuff. And it's usually not that big of a deal what they're talking about. But they're making a big point that you heard it here first. I mean, if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station or another, what difference does it make? 

Recording: (9543/ 9621) 
 But yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think it's like there's like a real like either it's old people who are there retiring or whatever or it's more of like a younger people there. I don't know. You don't see a lot. I don't know. There is middle-aged people there, but it's not so apparent like it is here I guess. 

Recording: (9544/ 9621) 
 I mean it was a pretty good place. I mean looking back on it, I remember it a lot better than when I was actually there. 

Recording: (9545/ 9621) 
 Yeah, but 50 years ago if you had epilepsy, they'd lock you in a closet and throw away the key and wouldn't let you out. Most of the parents I've seen, to me, I'd rather see the kids with a step-parent. 

Recording: (9546/ 9621) 
 I worked for a company called Highlights for Children. 

Recording: (9547/ 9621) 
 It's 

Recording: (9548/ 9621) 
 Yeah. No. No. Oh man, I was. 

Recording: (9549/ 9621) 
 Well, the one that's, um, 

Recording: (9550/ 9621) 
 Hehehehehehe 

Recording: (9551/ 9621) 
 They were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one dose. And they were giving him three doses. 

Recording: (9552/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9553/ 9621) 
 Right, right. 

Recording: (9554/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my aunts do. 

Recording: (9555/ 9621) 
 I have no idea. 

Recording: (9556/ 9621) 
 Right, well... 

Recording: (9557/ 9621) 
 Right, and you aren't as close to your family and the traditions and I think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that I don't think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have and I don't know, the culture is just so fast paced that I don't think people are, maybe it's not honesty, maybe it's just they don't have as much time to get attached and they're ready to move on again. You just don't get as close to people as you used to. 

Recording: (9558/ 9621) 
 And people don't have big families like they used to. 

Recording: (9559/ 9621) 
 Help them. 

Recording: (9560/ 9621) 
 That's just ridiculous too though. But yeah, to me that's really weird. I don't, like I said, I don't know what they're thinking or what their thought process was, but I'm thinking maybe the social, because a lot, to me high school was real social. 

Recording: (9561/ 9621) 
 Well that gets back to what you're saying almost in the family life. Hey, what's a hat? Well, you don't need a husband. All you need is a sperm bank That's what you're saying, aren't you? Aren't you? 

Recording: (9562/ 9621) 
 Well, I don't know how to explain that especially if anybody is going to listen to this. I had a friend that taught classes, human potential classes, was very interested and participated very in depth in the human potential movement. So, a gentleman by the name of Alexander Everett who really is the father of the human potential movement, moved out there and he was going to have a group of people work out there. And he said that, you know, I was qualified. Well, when we got out there, it just fell through, you know, and we all just lived our lives. But I was glad that, you know, that he got me out there because I adored it. I just loved it out there. 

Recording: (9563/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9564/ 9621) 
 Yeah, thanks. 

Recording: (9565/ 9621) 
 I think in the case of tie it should be used, but if there's a black woman who is very well qualified for a job and a white male who is equally qualified for the job, the black woman should get it. 

Recording: (9566/ 9621) 
 Thank you guys. 

Recording: (9567/ 9621) 
谢谢 

Recording: (9568/ 9621) 
 And the data they collect is just, I mean, there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail, but the basic data, essentially how many people live in the household, what are their ages and race, and that's it. And that's not a, I don't think that's a big secret myself. 

Recording: (9569/ 9621) 
 Right, right. Tremendous demand right now. 

Recording: (9570/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9571/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9572/ 9621) 
 He's from Ohio. 

Recording: (9573/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9574/ 9621) 
 It's up to him to resolve it. 

Recording: (9575/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9576/ 9621) 
 Try it if you have eight children. And if you're here in this country and you have eight children, why do you have eight children to start with? 

Recording: (9577/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9578/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9579/ 9621) 
 Exactly. 

Recording: (9580/ 9621) 
 And then they physically died before they got a chance to live. And when their spirit wakes up and finds out that they're physically dead and they can't do anything in a physical world anymore, they want to draw themselves to, especially if they were a bad person, they want to draw them to the brightest thing. 

Recording: (9581/ 9621) 
 They think they should get paid. And I happen to be the person to believe that if you live in his house, you contribute your share. You clean up your room, you help with the dishes, you take your plates from the table, rinse them off and put them there by the sink. You take turns doing the dishes if mom or somebody's busy and can't do it. You help and you do your share around the home and you don't do it because you're going to get paid for it. Well, daddy gets paid. Well, yeah, but daddy's the one that's supporting the household. You know, he's got to pay for all the utilities and the finances and the food we bring in and everything else. But everybody else has got to help here to make the home. And I think that that's one of the problems. Too many people think instead of just getting them to lovingly help each other because we're supposed to help each other. And this goes all the way back to what I said. You said beginning in school or kindergarten. I think it begins from the time the baby is born and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a bottle and rock it and sing to it, put it to bed and play with them and teach them things as they grow up. Teach them how to tie their shoes and take them off. Teach them how to do everything they're supposed to do. And oh, that reminds me of a joke. I got to tell this. Maybe this is off the record, but I read it in Reader's Digest the other day, and it said about this little... The mother was trying to teach a child how to put the clothes away. She said, go put it in a hamper, and the kid looked at her like, it's crazy. Hamper, hamper. Well, you know, where Daddy and Mommy and everybody, we put our clothes when we take them off. And the kid immediately took his clothes and went and he threw them down beside the Daddy's bed. 

Recording: (9582/ 9621) 
 Yeah, he just used that Raynex stuff. 

Recording: (9583/ 9621) 
 Yes. 

Recording: (9584/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9585/ 9621) 
 No, I mean it's nothing crazy, whatever they think they're gotten. 

Recording: (9586/ 9621) 
 If that happened, I would be 10 times more understanding and I would say, you know, I would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes. 

Recording: (9587/ 9621) 
 They weren't being represented. I don't know. I'll have to read. I didn't read the paper yet. 

Recording: (9588/ 9621) 
 It's a job. It's a full-time job. My wife and I are both like, I can't wait to get back to work. 

Recording: (9589/ 9621) 
 Well he's working part time at Lazarus but really he doesn't have anything. So I'm working 

Recording: (9590/ 9621) 
 Yeah, right, because I always keep using my oldest daughter. She can get up in the morning and brush her teeth and just barely comb her hair, put on a shirt and a pair of pants and go somewhere because she's comfortable with herself. She doesn't have to be made up. She doesn't have to look perfect. Now, my youngest one has to do that. And the oldest one, I look at her as, you know, I like myself. And if you don't like me, well, then move on. Maybe somebody else does. And that's the way I'm going to be, you know. And like I said, she can clean up and look like a beauty queen, but she can also look just like, you know, just basically, you know, like she was raking leaves 10 minutes ago. And my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect. And I just think that's sort of shallow because, you know, just basically, you know, like she was raking leaves 10 minutes ago and my other one will not leave the house without looking perfect. And I just think that's sort of shallow because, you know, I look at people who got, you know, they have to have the facelifts and they got to have the perfect hair and they got to have the perfect clothes. It's like, you're so insecure about the image you present that you've got to be perfect. And by gosh, if your hair is out of place, you're going to be out of the loop. And you know, if, if people were more comfortable with themselves, you know and I'm a big one to talk, I was like Mr. Insecure for 30 years at least and then I finally got to the point and I went to hell with it. You know it's too much work. You know either like me or don't. If you don't go to somebody else. And you know a lot of people are really worried and you know I don't know if boys so much but I know girls are really worried about what people think of them and how they look. And it's like, why don't you kind of like go past the outside and go inside? Because my wife was saying the other day, she says, well, I'm getting wrinkles and I'm thinning on top. And I go, well, obviously you're not looking too close at me. Because I said, mother nature has a way of making your vision get a little worse as time goes by. And I honestly feel it's so that that tight butt, tight skin woman that you married who is not there anymore still kind of looks that way because 

Recording: (9591/ 9621) 
 I'm gonna go. 

Recording: (9592/ 9621) 
 No, because like I work, like I said, my supervisor's a black woman. Now I get along good with her. The other woman is an Indian woman. I get along real good with her. The other guy's a black guy. I get along real good with her. But my supervisor's got a friend that's a black woman that works in another department. Now she'll come and talk to her and dump all her work onto us. 

Recording: (9593/ 9621) 
 is not going to work. 

Recording: (9594/ 9621) 
 She doesn't try to get her daughter back. She has visitation with her. I love her very, very much, you know, that way, emotionally. But boy, I'd like for her mom to take her back. Yeah. You know, I'm fortunate because I got a grant for her through the Y, YMCA, at a very nice learning center that she goes to every day. So, you know, of course a lot of that, you know, hinges on the fact that my son is a student and they're very pro-education, you know. So my son, he's back home now, but I wish he would go too. He just joined this fraternity. 

Recording: (9595/ 9621) 
 I was sitting down in my boyfriend's room and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone. I had my computer on, but nobody was sitting at it. 

Recording: (9596/ 9621) 
 you know, a check magnet. 

Recording: (9597/ 9621) 
 me 

Recording: (9598/ 9621) 
 Yeah, people that live there, I mean we've got the, you know, the Indian department stores right down there on High Street and a couple of Asian groceries. But, you know, I don't know where they live. I mean it seems like for those stores to be opening there, they must be somewhere in Clintonville, but I don't know. 

Recording: (9599/ 9621) 
 They've always been there. I mean, you know, I don't really care what the guy's specific thing is if he's in a box hole with me, you know, and as long as he can shoot a gun, you know, I mean, I could care less. I've got gay friends, you know, so. 

Recording: (9600/ 9621) 
 That's not my favorite age, I guess. 

Recording: (9601/ 9621) 
 But I think computers is going to really dominate. 

Recording: (9602/ 9621) 
 See, he's just, he's in his twos and I like, he's gotta be in a cart or something. Well, cause when I'm holding his hand and taking him, he just tends to want to, he's not calm and collective. He's a little, you know. So like, that's why we don't do nothing. Cause when I take him to people's houses, I can't do that because he'll get into everything. And I get real stressed out about that. 

Recording: (9603/ 9621) 
 It's just wonderful. I know, like, Saturday we're going to drive to Oberlin to watch swim tube events and come back. So, you know, she says, Mom, I'm only going to be in the water five minutes total. Why are you guys driving to Oberlin, Ohio for this? Because we wouldn't miss it. There'll be a time when we, you know, she won't be doing those things. So it's just important. It's wonderful. And I just think it's just such an opportunity. I'm so lucky to be able to do that. See, now, like, my husband, I'm 11 years older than he is. 

Recording: (9604/ 9621) 
 Me or 

Recording: (9605/ 9621) 
 know. 

Recording: (9606/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9607/ 9621) 
 But most of the time, it's not bad. So there's that. It's an opportunity for the musicians in the college to play in an orchestra. And what else do they get out of it? I don't know. Prestige, I suppose. Yeah. 

Recording: (9608/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9609/ 9621) 
 And here I am in a predicament, I can't say nothing to them. 

Recording: (9610/ 9621) 
 Here at college I really haven't witnessed any violence at all. 

Recording: (9611/ 9621) 
 Yeah, my wife and I like to do that. 

Recording: (9612/ 9621) 
 And now they have the little tiny grape tomatoes that are so cute. Haven't you seen the size of grapes? Yeah, they're darling. 

Recording: (9613/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9614/ 9621) 
 Yeah. 

Recording: (9615/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9616/ 9621) 
 The area I live in now is the Westgate area. We grew up on the Hilltop area, but I now live in the Westgate, which is a little further west. 

Recording: (9617/ 9621) 
 Oh, like, yeah, really? 

Recording: (9618/ 9621) 
 Really? Okay. 

Recording: (9619/ 9621) 
 Yeah, we're pretty white. 

Recording: (9620/ 9621) 
 Mm-hmm. 

Recording: (9621/ 9621) 
 And I was one of them type of people.
